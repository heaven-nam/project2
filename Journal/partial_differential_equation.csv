0,The Probabilistic Point of View on the Generalized Fractional Partial Differential Equations,"This paper aims at unifying and clarifying the recent advances in the analysis of the fractional and generalized fractional Partial Differential Equations of Caputo and Riemann-Liouville type arising essentially from the probabilistic point of view. This point of view leads to the path integral representation for the solutions of these equations, which is seen to be stable with respect to the initial data and key parameters and is directly amenable to numeric calculations (Monte-Carlo simulation). In many cases these solutions can be compactly presented via the wide class of operatorvalued analytic functions of the Mittag-Leffler type, which are proved to be expressed as the Laplace transforms of the exit times of monotone Markov processes.",Vassili N.

0,Normal Forms for Equivariant Differential Equations,"We show that if the equation \(x'=A(t) x + f(t,x)\) is equivariant (respectively, reversible), then any normal form as well as the coordinate change taking the original equation to the normal form have equivariance (respectively, reversibility) properties. The proof depends on writing down somewhat explicit coordinate changes based on the block diagonalization of the linear part so that each block corresponds to a connected component of the nonuniform spectrum.

0,Stochastic Control for Mean-Field Stochastic Partial Differential Equations with Jumps,"We study optimal control for mean-field stochastic partial differential equations (stochastic evolution equations) driven by a Brownian motion and an independent Poisson random measure, in case of partial information control. One important novelty of our problem is represented by the introduction of general mean-field operators, acting on both the controlled state process and the control process. We first formulate a sufficient and a necessary maximum principle for this type of control. We then prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution of such general forward and backward mean-field stochastic partial differential equations. We apply our results to find the explicit optimal control for an optimal harvesting problem.","Roxana Dumitrescu1, Bernt Øksendal2 & Agnès Sulem",Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-018-1243-3,"Mean-field stochastic partial differential equation,Optimal control,Mean-field backward stochastic partial differential equation,Stochastic maximum principles"
0,Using a cubic B-spline method in conjunction with a one-step optimized hybrid block approach to solve nonlinear partial differential equations,"In this paper, we develop an optimized hybrid block method which is combined with a modified cubic B-spline method, for solving non-linear partial differential equations. In particular, it will be applied for solving three well-known problems, namely, the Burgers equation, Buckmaster equation and FitzHugh–Nagumo equation. Most of the developed methods in the literature for non-linear partial differential equations have not focused on optimizing the time step-size and a very small value must be considered to get accurate approximations. The motivation behind the development of this work is to overcome this trade-off up to much extent using a larger time step-size without compromising accuracy. The optimized hybrid block method considered is proved to be A-stable and convergent. Furthermore, the obtained numerical approximations have been compared with exact and numerical solutions available in the literature and found to be adequate. In particular, without using quasilinearization or filtering techniques, the results for small viscosity coefficient for Burgers equation are found to be accurate. We have found that the combination of the two considered methods is computationally efficient for solving non-linear PDEs.","Higinio Ramos

0,A New Spline-in-Tension Method of O(\(k^{2}+h^{4})\) Based on Off-step Grid Points for the Solution of 1D Quasi-linear Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations in Vector Form,"In this paper, we propose a new three level implicit method based on half-step spline in tension method of order two in time and four in space for the solution of one-space dimensional quasi-linear hyperbolic partial differential equation of the form \(w_{tt}=K(x,t,w)w_{xx} + {\varphi }(x,t,w,w_{x},w_{t})\). We describe spline in tension approximations and its properties using two half-step grid points. The new method for one dimensional quasi-linear hyperbolic equation is obtained directly from the consistency condition. In this method we use three grid points for the unknown function w(x, t) and two half-step points for the known variable ‘x’ in x-direction. The proposed method when applied to Telegraphic equation is shown to be unconditionally stable. Further, the stability condition for 1-D linear hyperbolic equation with variable coefficients is established. Our method is directly applicable to hyperbolic equations irrespective of the coordinate system which is the main advantage of our work.

0,How to approximate the Dirac equation with the Mauser method,"Mauser and coworkers discussed in a series of papers an ansatz how to split the Dirac equation and the wave function appearing therein into a part related to a free moving electron and another part related to a free moving positron. This ansatz includes an expansion of these quantities into orders of the reciprocal of the speed of light \(\epsilon = 1/c\). In particular, in Mauser (VLSI Design 9:415, 1999) it is discussed how to apply this expansion up to the second order in the reciprocal of the speed of light \(\epsilon \). As an expansion of this analysis, we show in this work how all three well-known terms that appear in an expansion of the Dirac equation in second order on the reciprocal of the speed of light, namely, a relativistic correction to the kinetic energy, the Darwin term, and the spin-orbit interaction, can be found using the ansatz of Mauser—and doing so, we close a gap between this ansatz to approximate the Dirac equation and other approximative results found using the Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation.","Klaus Renziehausen

The problem of solving such equations without triangulating surfaces is of increasing importance in various applications, and their discretization has recently been investigated in the framework of finite difference methods. For the two most frequently used implicit representations of surfaces, namely level set methods and phase-field methods, we discuss the construction of finite element schemes, the solution of the arising discretized problems, and provide error estimates. The convergence properties of the finite element methods are illustrated by computations for several test problems.",Martin Burger,Computing and Visualization in Science,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00791-007-0081-x,"Weak Solution,Implicit Representation,Finite Element Approximation,Elliptic Partial Differential Equation,Implicit Surface"

0,Numerical Methods for Solving Space Fractional Partial Differential Equations Using Hadamard Finite-Part Integral Approach,"We introduce a novel numerical method for solving two-sided space fractional partial differential equations in two-dimensional case. The approximation of the space fractional Riemann–Liouville derivative is based on the approximation of the Hadamard finite-part integral which has the convergence order \(O(h^{3- \alpha })\), where h is the space step size and \(\alpha \in (1, 2)\) is the order of Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative. Based on this scheme, we introduce a shifted finite difference method for solving space fractional partial differential equations. We obtained the error estimates with the convergence orders \(O(\tau +h^{3-\alpha }+ h^{\beta })\), where \(\tau\) is the time step size and \(\beta >0\) is a parameter which measures the smoothness of the fractional derivatives of the solution of the equation. Unlike the numerical methods for solving space fractional partial differential equations constructed using the standard shifted Grünwald–Letnikov formula or higher order Lubich’s methods which require the solution of the equation to satisfy the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition to get the first-order convergence, the numerical method for solving the space fractional partial differential equation constructed using the Hadamard finite-part integral approach does not require the solution of the equation to satisfy the Dirichlet homogeneous boundary condition. Numerical results show that the experimentally determined convergence order obtained using the Hadamard finite-part integral approach for solving the space fractional partial differential equation with non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions is indeed higher than the convergence order obtained using the numerical methods constructed with the standard shifted Grünwald–Letnikov formula or Lubich’s higher order approximation schemes.","Yanyong Wang1, Yubin Yan2 & Ye Hu",Communications on Applied Mathematics and Computation,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42967-019-00036-7,"Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative,Space fractional partial differential equation,Error estimates"

0,On the Formulaic Solution of a \((n+1)\)th Order Differential Equation,"A systematic method to facilitate the solution of a \((n+1)\)th order differential equation is introduced. This set of ordinary differential equations is unique in the sense that it defines a hierarchy whose solution can be manipulated to solve a partial differential hierarchy, called Burgers’ hierarchy. The latter forms a highly nonlinear evolutionary class of equations. Our approach can be described as in the following two ways. Firstly, we construct the one-parameter Lie group of transformations that leave the ordinary differential equation invariant, and find that they are universally derived from the \((n+1)\) complex roots of a certain polynomial. Secondly, we prove that the exact solution of the hierarchy for all values of n, is given by an integration formula. An important consequence of this study, is the extension of the formulaic method to exactly solve the entire Burgers’ hierarchy. We exemplify the advantageous nature of our results through solving various members of the hierarchy.

0,A local least-squares method for solving nonlinear partial differential equations of second order,"In this paper a mesh-free method for the treatment of time-independent and time-dependent nonlinear PDEs of second order is presented. The basic idea of the discretization is a local least-squares approximation, similar to the moving least-squares approach in data approximation. However, in our approach the PDE is incorporated as an additional minimization constraint. The discretization leads to a fixed-point problem, which is solved by iteration. Because of the local nature of the method only small dimensional matrix inversions have to be done. The approximation error of the discretization—even on unstructured meshes—is comparable to respective versions of finite elements. As a by-product the method provides an a posteriori measure for the local approximation error.

We prove that this method has the convergence order O(τ3−α) for all α ∈ (0, 1) when the first and second derivatives of the solution are vanish at t = 0, where τ is the time step size and α is the fractional order in the Caputo sense. We then introduce a new time discretization method for solving time fractional partial differential equations, which has no requirements for the initial values as imposed in Li et al. [21]. We show that this new method also has the convergence order O(τ3−α) for all α ∈ (0, 1). The proofs of the error estimates are based on the energy method developed recently by Lv and Xu [26]. We also consider the space discretization by using the finite element method. Error estimates with convergence order O(τ3−α + h2) are proved in the fully discrete case, where h is the space step size. Numerical examples in both one- and two-dimensional cases are given to show that the numerical results are consistent with the theoretical results.","Zhiqiang Li1,2 & Yubin Yan",Fractional Calculus and Applied Analysis,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1515/fca-2018-0039,"Primary 65M06,Secondary 65M12, 65M15, 26A33, 35R11"

Our results improve previous related ones for linear [18] and nonlinear [22] equations because we weaken structural assumptions on the nonlinearities. Counterexamples show that our results are optimal. Moreover they are complemented by comparison and uniqueness results, in which a viscosity subsolution is compared with a piecewise classical supersolution. It is curious to note that existence of a piecewise classical solution to a fully nonlinear problem implies its uniqueness in the larger class of continuous viscosity solutions.",Bernd Kawohl1 & Nikolai Kutev,Archiv der Mathematik,1998,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s000130050221,"Differential Equation,Partial Differential Equation,Spatial Variable,Maximum Principle,Large Class"
0,A modified formal Lagrangian formulation for general differential equations,"In this paper, we propose a modified formal Lagrangian formulation by introducing dummy dependent variables and prove the existence of such a formulation for any system of differential equations. The corresponding Euler–Lagrange equations, consisting of the original system and its adjoint system about the dummy variables, reduce to the original system via a simple substitution for the dummy variables. The formulation is applied to study conservation laws of differential equations through Noether’s Theorem and in particular, a nontrivial conservation law of the Fornberg–Whitham equation is obtained by using its Lie point symmetries. Finally, a correspondence between conservation laws of the incompressible Euler equations and variational symmetries of the relevant modified formal Lagrangian is shown.","Linyu Peng

These formulas are based on finite difference schemes in both the spatial and temporal directions. One of these schemes reduces to a Runge-Kutta type formula when the equations are linear. On practical grounds the methods are restricted to schemes that are fourth order in time and either second, fourth or sixth order in space. For hyperbolic problems the second order in space methods are not useful while the fourth order methods offer no advantage over the Kreiss-Oliger method unless very fine meshes are used. Advantages are first achieved using sixth order methods in space coupled with fourth order accuracy in time. The averaging procedure advocated by Gragg does not increase the efficiency of the scheme. For parabolic problems severe stability restrictions are encountered that limit the applicability to problems with large cell Reynolds number.

In spatial direction, the Galerkin finite element method is presented.

By using the properties of the fractional Ritz projection and the fractional Ritz–Volterra projection, the convergence analyses of semi-discretization scheme and full discretization scheme are derived separately. Due to the lack of smoothness of the exact solution, the numerical accuracy does not achieve second order convergence in time, which is \(O(k^{3-\beta }+k^{3}t_{n+1}^{-\beta }+k^{3}t_{n+1}^{-\beta -1})\), \(n=0,1,\ldots ,N-1\).

0,"Analyticity, Regularity, and Generalized Polynomial Chaos Approximation of Stochastic, Parametric Parabolic Two-Scale Partial Differential Equations","We study two-scale parabolic partial differential equations whose coefficient is stochastic and depends linearly on a sequence of pairwise independent random variables which are uniformly distributed in a compact interval. We cast the problem into a deterministic two-scale parabolic problem which depends on a sequence of real parameters in a compact interval. Passing to the limit when the microscale tends to zero, using two-scale homogenization, we obtain the parametric two-scale homogenized problem. This problem contains the solution to the homogenized equation which describes the solution to the original two-scale parabolic problem macroscopically, and the corrector which encodes the microscopic information. The solution of this two-scale homogenized equation is represented as a generalized polynomial chaos (gpc) expansion according to a polynomial basis of the L2 space of the parameters. We use a semidiscrete Galerkin approximation which projects the solution into a space of parametric functions which contain a finite number of pre-chosen gpc modes. Analyticity of the solution of the two-scale homogenized equation with respect to the parameters is established. Under mild assumptions, we show the summability of the coefficients of the solution’s gpc expansion. From this, an explicit error estimate for the semidiscrete Galerkin approximation in terms of the number of the chosen gpc modes is derived when these gpc modes are chosen as the N best ones according to the norms of the gpc coefficients. Regularity of the gpc coefficients and summability of their norms in the regularity spaces are also established. Using the solution of the best N term semidiscrete Galerkin approximation, we derive an approximation for the solution of the original two-scale problem, with an explicit convergence rate in terms of the microscopic scale and the number of gpc modes in the Galerkin approximation.","Viet Ha Hoang

0,A hybrid numerical method to solve nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations of time-arbitrary order,"In this study, the Quasi-Linearization Method (QLM) is combined with the collocation method, based on the bivariate generalized fractional order of the Chebyshev functions (B-GFCFs), to solve higher order nonlinear partial differential equations (NPDEs) of the evolution parabolic kind with the time-arbitrary (integer or fractional) order, where are very important because the description of various mechanisms in physics and engineering. The method is used for solving some famous NPDEs, such as the generalized Burgers–Fisher equation, the Fisher equation, the Burgers–Huxley equation, and the modified KdV–Burgers equation. First, the QLM converts the nonlinear equation to a sequence of linear partial differential equations (LPDEs), and then these LPDEs are solved using the B-GFCFs collocation method. In the time-fractional case, we use the Caputo fractional derivative operational matrix to get rid of the fractional derivative. An algorithm is presented by examining its complexity order for the method, as also, the convergence analysis, error analysis, and error estimate for the method are briefly investigated.

This algorithm, which was motivated by statistical physics, is now interpreted as gradient descent on a modified loss function. The modified, or relaxed, loss function is the solution of a viscous Hamilton–Jacobi partial differential equation (PDE). Experimental results on modern, high-dimensional neural networks demonstrate that the algorithm converges faster than the benchmark stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Well-established PDE regularity results allow us to analyze the geometry of the relaxed energy landscape, confirming empirical evidence.

SAV approach was originally proposed for the gradient flows that have lower-bounded nonlinear potentials such as the Allen–Cahn and Cahn–Hilliard equations, and this assumption on the energy was essential. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address gradient flows with unbounded energy functionals such as the KdV equation by a decomposition of energy functionals. Further, we will show that the equation of the SAV approach, which is a system of equations with scalar auxiliary variables, is expressed as another gradient system that inherits the variational structure of the original system. This expression allows us to construct novel higher-order integrators by a certain class of Runge-Kutta methods.

0,Maximum Principles of Markov Regime-Switching Forward–Backward Stochastic Differential Equations with Jumps and Partial Information,"This paper presents three versions of maximum principle for a stochastic optimal control problem of Markov regime-switching forward–backward stochastic differential equations with jumps. First, a general sufficient maximum principle for optimal control for a system, driven by a Markov regime-switching forward–backward jump–diffusion model, is developed. In the regime-switching case, it might happen that the associated Hamiltonian is not concave and hence the classical maximum principle cannot be applied. Hence, an equivalent type maximum principle is introduced and proved. In view of solving an optimal control problem when the Hamiltonian is not concave, we use a third approach based on Malliavin calculus to derive a general stochastic maximum principle. This approach also enables us to derive an explicit solution of a control problem when the concavity assumption is not satisfied. In addition, the framework we propose allows us to apply our results to solve a recursive utility maximization problem.","Olivier Menoukeu Pamen1,2,",Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-017-1144-x,"Forward–backward stochastic differential equations,Malliavin calculus,Regime switching,Recursive utility maximization,Stochastic maximum principle"

When we solve a system of discrete equations arising from the finite difference discretization of the PDE, we can use iterative algorithms such as conjugate gradient, generalized minimum residual, and multigrid methods. An iterative method is a numerical approach that generates a sequence of improved approximate solutions for a system of equations. We repeat the iterative algorithm until a numerical solution is within a specified tolerance. Therefore, even though the discretization is conservative, the actual numerical solution obtained from an iterative method is not conservative. We propose a simple projection method which projects the non-conservative numerical solution into a conservative one by using the original scheme.

We show that for \(n=1\), the squeezing function on an annulus \(A_r = \lbrace z \in {\mathbb {C}} : r<|z| <1 \rbrace \) is given by \(S_{A_r}(z)= \max \left\{ |z| ,\frac{r}{|z|} \right\} \) for all \(0<r<1\). This disproves the conjectured formula for the squeezing function proposed by Deng, Guan and Zhang and establishes (up to biholomorphisms) the squeezing function for all doubly-connected domains in \({\mathbb {C}}\) other than the punctured plane. It provides the first non-trivial formula for the squeezing function for a wide class of plane domains and answers a question of Wold. Our main tools used to prove this result are the Schottky–Klein prime function (following the work of Crowdy) and a version of the Loewner differential equation on annuli due to Komatu.

0,On semi-linear degenerate backward stochastic partial differential equations," In this paper we study a class of one-dimensional, degenerate, semilinear backward stochastic partial differential equations (BSPDEs, for short) of parabolic type. By establishing some new a priori estimates for both linear and semilinear BSPDEs, we show that the regularity and uniform boundedness of the adapted solution to the semilinear BSPDE can be determined by those of the coefficients, a special feature that one usually does not expect from a stochastic differential equation. The proof follows the idea of the so-called bootstrap method, which enables us to analyze each of the derivatives of the solution under consideration. Some related results, including some comparison theorems of the adapted solutions for semilinear BSPDEs, as well as a nonlinear stochastic Feynman-Kac formula, are also given.","Ying Hu1, Jin Ma2 & Jiongmin Yong",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004400100193,"Differential Equation,Partial Differential Equation,Stochastic Differential Equation,Related Result,Bootstrap Method"
0,A Novel Weakly-Intrusive Non-linear Multiresolution Framework for Uncertainty Quantification in Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations,"In this paper, a novel multiresolution framework, namely the Truncate and Encode (TE) approach, previously proposed by some of the authors (Abgrall et al. in J Comput Phys 257:19–56, 2014. doi:10.1016/j.jcp.2013.08.006), is generalized and extended for taking into account uncertainty in partial differential equations (PDEs). Innovative ingredients are given by an algorithm permitting to recover the multiresolution representation without requiring the fully resolved solution, the possibility to treat a whatever form of pdf and the use of high-order (even non-linear, i.e. data-dependent) reconstruction in the stochastic space. Moreover, the spatial-TE method is introduced, which is a weakly intrusive scheme for uncertainty quantification (UQ), that couples the physical and stochastic spaces by minimizing the computational cost for PDEs. The proposed scheme is particularly attractive when treating moving discontinuities (such as shock waves in compressible flows), even if they appear during the simulations as it is common in unsteady aerodynamics applications. The proposed method is very flexible since it can easily coupled with different deterministic schemes, even with high-resolution features. Flexibility and performances of the present method are demonstrated on various numerical test cases (algebraic functions and ordinary differential equations), including partial differential equations, both linear and non-linear, in presence of randomness. The efficiency of the proposed strategy for solving stochastic linear advection and Burgers equation is shown by comparison with some classical techniques for UQ, namely Monte Carlo or the non-intrusive polynomial chaos methods.","Gianluca Geraci1, Pietro Marco Congedo2, Rémi Abgrall3 & …Gianluca Iaccarino",Journal of Scientific Computing,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-015-0026-3,"Multiresolution,Uncertainty quantification,Adaptive grid,ENO,MUSCL,Hyperbolic conservation laws"

0,A Decision-Making Machine Learning Approach in Hermite Spectral Approximations of Partial Differential Equations,"The accuracy and effectiveness of Hermite spectral methods for the numerical discretization of partial differential equations on unbounded domains are strongly affected by the amplitude of the Gaussian weight function employed to describe the approximation space. This is particularly true if the problem is under-resolved, i.e., there are no enough degrees of freedom. The issue becomes even more crucial when the equation under study is time-dependent, forcing in this way the choice of Hermite functions where the corresponding weight depends on time. In order to adapt dynamically the approximation space, it is here proposed an automatic decision-making process that relies on machine learning techniques, such as deep neural networks and support vector machines. The algorithm is numerically tested with success on a simple 1D problem, but the main goal is its exportability in the context of more serious applications. As a matter of fact we also show at the end an application in the framework of plasma physics.

The so-called port-Hamiltonian systems cover, for instance, the wave equation and the transport equation, but also networks of the aforementioned equations fit into this framework. Our main results firstly characterize the boundary conditions which turn the corresponding linear operator into the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup.

0,Particle-without-Particle: A Practical Pseudospectral Collocation Method for Linear Partial Differential Equations with Distributional Sources,"Partial differential equations with distributional sources—in particular, involving (derivatives of) delta distributions—have become increasingly ubiquitous in numerous areas of physics and applied mathematics. It is often of considerable interest to obtain numerical solutions for such equations, but any singular (“particle”-like) source modeling invariably introduces nontrivial computational obstacles. A common method to circumvent these is through some form of delta function approximation procedure on the computational grid; however, this often carries significant limitations on the efficiency of the numerical convergence rates, or sometimes even the resolvability of the problem at all. In this paper, we present an alternative technique for tackling such equations which avoids the singular behavior entirely: the “Particle-without-Particle” method. Previously introduced in the context of the self-force problem in gravitational physics, the idea is to discretize the computational domain into two (or more) disjoint pseudospectral (Chebyshev–Lobatto) grids such that the “particle” is always at the interface between them; thus, one only needs to solve homogeneous equations in each domain, with the source effectively replaced by jump (boundary) conditions thereon. We prove here that this method yields solutions to any linear PDE the source of which is any linear combination of delta distributions and derivatives thereof supported on a one-dimensional subspace of the problem domain. We then implement it to numerically solve a variety of relevant PDEs: hyperbolic (with applications to neuroscience and acoustics), parabolic (with applications to finance), and elliptic. We generically obtain improved convergence rates relative to typical past implementations relying on delta function approximations.","Marius Oltean

We construct diffusion wavelets using an approximation of second-order differential operators. We test the squeezing error behavior corresponding to different parameters involved in the constructed diffusion wavelet, using two test functions. The diffusion wavelet is used to construct adaptive grid arrangements and the fast computation of the diffusion operator’s dual power. The constructed adaptive grid arrangements and dual power of diffusion operators are more effective for finding the numerical solutions of PDEs. Test problems verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. For each test problem, the processing time taken by ADWM is compared with the existing methods like the fast diffusion wavelet method (FDWM) and finite difference method (FDM). The proposed method (ADWM) takes lesser processing time than FDWM and FDM. We verify the convergence of the given method.

0,A Robust Numerical Approach for Singularly Perturbed Time Delayed Parabolic Partial Differential Equations,"A numerical study for a class of singularly perturbed partial functional differential equation has been initiated. The solution of the problem, being contaminated by a small perturbation parameter, exhibits layer behavior. There exist narrow regions, in the neighborhood of outflow boundary, where the solution has steep gradient. The presence of parasitic parameters, perturbation parameter and time delay, is often the source for the increased order and stiffness of these systems. The stiffness, attributed to the simultaneous occurrence of slow and fast phenomena and on their dependence on the past history of the physical systems. A numerical method based on standard finite difference operator is presented. The first step involves a discretization of time variable using backward Euler method. This results into a set of stationary singularly perturbed semi-discrete problems which are further discretized in space using standard finite difference operators. A priori explicit bounds on the solution of problem are established. Extensive amount of analysis is carried out in order to establish the convergence and stability of the method proposed.","Manju Sharma1,",Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12591-016-0280-3,"Unsteady parabolic partial differential equation,Time delayed,Singular perturbation,Uniform mesh,Discretization"

In our numerical scheme the Laplace transform is used to avoid the time stepping procedure, and the local meshless method is used to produce sparse differentiation matrices and avoid the ill conditioning issues resulting in global meshless methods. Our numerical method comprises three steps. In the first step we transform the given equation to an equivalent time independent equation. Secondly the reduced equation is solved via a local meshless method. Finally, the solution of the original equation is obtained via the inverse Laplace transform by representing it as a contour integral in the complex left half plane. The contour integral is then approximated using the trapezoidal rule. The stability and convergence of the method are discussed. The efficiency, efficacy, and accuracy of the proposed method are assessed using four different problems.

Incomplete nested dissection and domain decomposition are used to distribute the domain among the processors and to organize the matrix into sections in which pivoting is applied to stabilize the factorization of indefinite equation sets. The algorithm is highly parallel and memory efficient; the efficient use of sparsity in the matrix allows the solution of larger problems as the number of processors is increased, and minimizes computations as well as the number and volume of communications among the processors. The number of messages and the total volume of messages passed during factorization, which are used as measures of algorithm efficiency, are reduced significantly compared to other algorithms.

We present a technique for the rapid and reliable optimization of systems characterized by linear-functional outputs of coercive elliptic partial differential equations with affine (input) parameter dependence. The critical ingredients are: reduced-basis approximation to effect significant reduction in state-space dimensionality; a posteriori error bounds to provide rigorous error estimation and control; “offline/online” computational decompositions to permit rapid evaluation of output bounds, output bound gradients, and output bound Hessians in the limit of many queries; and reformulation of the approximate optimization statement to ensure (true) feasibility and control of suboptimality. To illustrate the method we consider the design of a three-dimensional thermal fin: Given volume and power objective-function weights, and root temperature “not-to-exceed” limits, the optimal geometry and heat transfer coefficient can be determined—with guaranteed feasibility—in only 2.3 seconds on a 500 MHz Pentium machine; note the latter includes only the online component of the calculations. Our method permits not only interactive optimal design at conception and manufacturing, but also real-time reliable adaptive optimal design in operation.

This approach gives a great flexibility, and allows, in many cases the construction of simple linearly implicit schemes without any Newton’s iteration. This is obtained by identifying the (possibly linear) dependence on the unknown of the system which generates the stiffness. Only the stiff dependence is treated implicitly, then making the whole method much simpler than fully implicit ones. The resulting schemes are denoted as semi-implicit R–K.

Superconvergence results for the solution itself and the auxiliary variables are established. To be more precise, we first prove that, for any polynomial of degree k, the errors of numerical fluxes at nodes and for the cell averages are superconvergent under some suitable initial discretization, with an order of \(O(h^{2k+1})\). We then prove that the LDG solution is \((k+2)\)-th order superconvergent towards a particular projection of the exact solution and the auxiliary variables. As byproducts, we obtain a \((k+1)\)-th and \((k+2)\)-th order superconvergence rate for the derivative and function value approximation separately at a class of Radau points. Moreover, for the auxiliary variables, we, for the first time, prove that the convergence rate of the derivative error at the interior Radau points can reach as high as \(k+2\).

A traveling wave solution is hard to obtain with traditional numerical methods when the corresponding wave speed is unknown in advance. We propose a novel method to approximate both the traveling wave solution and the unknown wave speed via a neural network and an additional free parameter. We proved that under a mild assumption, the neural network solution converges to the analytic solution and the free parameter accurately approximates the wave speed as the corresponding loss tends to zero for the Keller–Segel equation. We also demonstrate in the experiments that reducing loss through training assures an accurate approximation of the traveling wave solution and the wave speed for the Keller–Segel equation, the Allen–Cahn model with relaxation, and the Lotka–Volterra competition model.","Sung Woong Cho1 na1, Hyung Ju Hwang

There are two different approaches to the sparsity study of control problems. One approach consists of taking functions to control the system, putting in the cost functional a convenient term that promotes the sparsity of the optimal control. A second approach deals with controls that are Borel measures and the norm of the measure is involved in the cost functional. The use of measures as controls allows to obtain optimal controls supported on a zero Lebesgue measure set, which is very interesting for practical implementation. If the state equation is linear, then we can carry out a complete analysis of the control problem with measures. However, if the equation is nonlinear the use of measures to control the system is still an open problem, in general, and the use of functions to control the system seems to be more appropriate.",Eduardo Casas,SeMA Journal,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40324-017-0121-5,"Sparse controls,Measure controls,Elliptic equations,Parabolic equations"

In the field of integral equations, a successful technique for handling dense matrices efficiently is to use a data-sparse representation like the popular multipole method. In this paper we prove that this approach can be generalized to cover inverse matrices corresponding to partial differential equations by switching to data-sparse \({\mathcal{H}}\)- and \({\mathcal{H}^2}\)-matrices.

This equation models a simple electrostatic Micro-Electromechanical System (MEMS) device consisting of a thin dielectric elastic membrane with boundary supported at 0 above a rigid ground plate located at –1. Here u is modeled to describe dynamic deflection of the elastic membrane. When a voltage–represented here by λ– is applied, the membrane deflects towards the ground plate and a snap-through (touchdown) may occur when it exceeds a certain critical value λ* (pull-in voltage), creating a so-called “pull-in instability” which greatly affects the design of many devices. In an effort to achieve better MEMS designs, the material properties of the membrane can be technologically fabricated with a spatially varying dielectric permittivity profile f(x). We show that when \({\rm \lambda} \leq {\rm \lambda}^{*}\) the membrane globally converges to its unique maximal steady-state. On the other hand, if λ > λ* the membrane must touchdown at finite time T, and that touchdown cannot occur at a location where the permittivity profile vanishes. We establish upper and lower bounds on first touchdown times, and we analyze their dependence on f, λ and Ω by applying various analytical and numerical techniques.

0,Reduced-basis output bounds for approximately parametrized elliptic coercive partial differential equations,"We present a technique for the rapid and reliable prediction of linear-functional outputs of elliptic coercive partial differential equations with (approximately) affine parameter dependence. The essential components are (i) (provably) rapidly convergent global reduced-basis approximations – Galerkin projection onto a space WN spanned by solutions of the governing partial differential equation at N selected points in parameter space; (ii) a posteriori error estimation – relaxations of the error-residual equation that provide inexpensive yet sharp bounds for the error in the outputs of interest; and (iii) off-line/on-line computational procedures – methods which decouple the generation and projection stages of the approximation process. The operation count for the on-line stage – in which, given a new parameter value, we calculate the output of interest and associated error bound – depends only on N, typically very small, and the (approximate) parametric complexity of the problem; the method is thus ideally suited for the repeated and rapid evaluations required in the context of parameter estimation, design, optimization, and real-time control.In our earlier work, we develop a rigorous a posteriori error bound framework for the case in which the parametrization of the partial differential equation is exact; in this paper, we address the situation in which our mathematical model is not “complete.” In particular, we permit error in the data that define our partial differential operator: this error may be introduced, for example, by imperfect specification, measurement, calculation, or parametric expansion of a coefficient function. We develop both accurate predictions for the outputs of interest and associated rigorous a posteriori error bounds; and the latter incorporate both numerical discretization and “model truncation” effects.

0,Exponential moments for numerical approximations of stochastic partial differential equations,"Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) have become a crucial ingredient in a number of models from economics and the natural sciences. Many SPDEs that appear in such applications include non-globally monotone nonlinearities. Solutions of SPDEs with non-globally monotone nonlinearities are in nearly all cases not known explicitly. Such SPDEs can thus only be solved approximatively and it is an important research problem to construct and analyze discrete numerical approximation schemes which converge with strong convergence rates to the solutions of such SPDEs. In the case of finite dimensional stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs) with non-globally monotone nonlinearities it has recently been revealed that exponential integrability properties of the discrete numerical approximation scheme are a key instrument to establish strong convergence rates for the considered approximation scheme. Exponential integrability properties for appropriate approximation schemes have been established in the literature in the case of a large class of finite dimensional SODEs. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no result in the scientific literature which proves exponential integrability properties for a time discrete approximation scheme in the case of a SPDE. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no result in the scientific literature which establishes strong convergence rates for a time discrete approximation scheme in the case of a SPDE with a non-globally monotone nonlinearity. In this paper we propose a new class of tamed space-time-noise discrete exponential Euler approximation schemes that admit exponential integrability properties in the case of SPDEs. More specifically, the main result of this article proves that these approximation schemes enjoy exponential integrability properties for a large class of semilinear SPDEs with possibly non-globally monotone nonlinearities. In particular, we establish exponential moment bounds for the proposed approximation schemes in the case of stochastic Burgers equations, stochastic Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equations, and two-dimensional stochastic Navier–Stokes equations.","Arnulf Jentzen1 & Primož Pušnik

0,Finite Difference Method with Metaheuristic Orientation for Exploration of Time Fractional Partial Differential Equations,"This exposition deals with the implementation of a robust nature inspired metaheuristic technique for computing the approximate solutions of Caputo type nonlinear time fractional partial differential equations (PDEs) in an effective and fruitful manner. The proposed finite difference metaheuristic solver (FDMS) comprises the fourfold procedure of Laplace transformation, approximation via finite difference scheme, fabrication of the global residue function in the root mean square sense and finally the optimization of the constructed residue function by utilization of three distinct nature inspired metaheuristic techniques, which belongs to the physics, evolution and the swarm based categories. The offered FDMS is benchmarked on some well-known and extensively used time fractional PDEs. The computed results are compared with the available exact solution and some former numerical and metaheuristic techniques, which expounds the correctness and accuracy of the suggested technique. Detailed performance analysis is carried out to perform an in-depth investigation and examination of the proposed design methodology in terms of accuracy, convergence and consistency. Moreover, statistical inference is drawn on the basis of large independent runs of the projected metaheuristic algorithm. The results of statistical parameters in terms of mean, standard deviation and mean deviation that are calculated on the basis of hundred independent runs certifies the functionality and reliability of the recommended technique.",Najeeb Alam Khan1 & Samreen Ahmed,International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40819-021-01061-y,"Partial differential equations,Caputo derivative,Metaheuristic optimization,Finite difference method"
0,On the construction of accurate difference schemes for hyperbolic partial differential equations,"Methods are developed for increasing the fidelity of difference approximations to hyperbolic partial differential equations. A relation between the truncation error and the exact and approximate amplification factors is derived. Based upon this relation, quantitative criteria for the minimization of dissipation and dispersion are derived, and difference schemes which satisfy these criteria are constructed. Completely new schemes, one of them promising, are obtained, together with several well-known schemes. One of these is the Fromm scheme, for which previously only a heuristic derivation could be given. It is shown that in general the accuracy of the Rusanov-Burstein-Mirin scheme is disappointing.

0,Existence Results for Some Partial Integro-Differential Equations,"In this note, we deal with semilinear integro-differential equations subject to homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions given on the boundaries of the sections. Even if the differentiation will be taken only in some directions, it is not possible to see the main problem parameterized by the other coordinates because of the non-local terms which also obliged the problem to be degenerate. We establish the existence of solutions by employing the singular perturbations method as a natural tool. The perturbed problems are classical, non-local, semilinear elliptic problems and the limits of the subsequences of their solutions, in weighted Sobolev type spaces, are solutions of the main problem. Some improvement, concerning the existence of the solutions and the convergence results depending on the weights, will be established.

The underlying method is spectral element method. The least-squares formulation is based on the minimization of a functional as defined in (4.1). The jump in the solution and its normal derivative across the interface are enforced (in an appropriate Sobolev norm) in the functional. The solution is obtained by solving the normal equations using preconditioned conjugate gradient method. Essentially the method is nonconforming, so a block diagonal matrix is constructed as a preconditioner based on the stability estimate where each diagonal block is decoupled. A conforming solution is obtained by making a set of corrections to the nonconforming solution as in Schwab (p and h–p Finite Element Methods, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1998) and an error estimate in H

The approximate solutions of these equations are considered as linear combinations of Müntz–Legendre polynomials with unknown coefficients. Operational matrix of fractional differentiation is provided to accelerate computations of the proposed method. Using Padé approximation and two-sided Laplace transformations, the mentioned delay fractional partial differential equations will be transformed to a sequence of fractional partial differential equations without delay. The localization process is based on the space-time collocation in some appropriate points to reduce the fractional partial differential equations into the associated system of algebraic equations which can be solved by some robust iterative solvers.

0,Approximation of partial differential equations on compact resistance spaces,"We consider linear partial differential equations on resistance spaces that are uniformly elliptic and parabolic in the sense of quadratic forms and involve abstract gradient and divergence terms. Our main interest is to provide graph and metric graph approximations for their unique solutions. For families of equations with different coefficients on a single compact resistance space we prove that solutions have accumulation points with respect to the uniform convergence in space, provided that the coefficients remain bounded. If in a sequence of equations the coefficients converge suitably, the solutions converge uniformly along a subsequence. For the special case of local resistance forms on finitely ramified sets we also consider sequences of resistance spaces approximating the finitely ramified set from within. Under suitable assumptions on the coefficients (extensions of) linearizations of the solutions of equations on the approximating spaces accumulate or even converge uniformly along a subsequence to the solution of the target equation on the finitely ramified set. The results cover discrete and metric graph approximations, and both are discussed.

We first show that the errors of the numerical solution of the Poisson equation on the unit ball in arbitrary dimensions can be identified by the approximation errors of the (weighted) \(L^2\)-projection of the right-hand function together with the non-homogeneous boundary function. This result indicates that the decay rate of the high frequency coefficients of the right-hand term in weighted orthogonal ball polynomials and of the boundary term in spherical harmonics serves as an ideal a posteriori error estimator. In the sequel, we establish a posteriori error estimates on the Galerkin spectral method applied to the singular perturbation problem of a reaction–diffusion equation on the unit ball. Again, the efficiency is given by the approximation errors of the weighted \(L^2\)-projection of the right-hand function; while the reliability is determined by the truncation errors of the right-hand function together with exponentially decaying multiples of the low frequency coefficients, which also reveals that the a posterior error estimator is dominated by the decay rate of the high frequency coefficients of the right-hand term.

0,A new hierarchically-structured n-dimensional covariant form of rotating equations of geophysical fluid dynamics,"We introduce n-dimensional equations of geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) valid on rotating n-dimensional manifolds. Moreover, by using straight and twisted differential forms and an auxiliary velocity field, we introduce hierarchically-structured equations of (geophysical) fluid dynamics in which the equations are split into metric-free and metric-dependent parts. For these sets of equations we provide representations in local coordinate charts and we show that they conserve potential vorticity and that Kelvin’s circulation theorem holds. As such general n-dimensional formulations do not exist in vector calculus, we provide for both covariant and vector-invariant equations a representation on a rotating coordinate frame in an Euclidean space and compare these representations. This study reveals, among others, that the prognostic variables, described by straight and twisted differential forms, are independent of both metric and orientation. This makes them perfect descriptors of the fluid’s quantities of interest, as they assign, analogously to physical measurement devices, real valued numbers to finite distances, areas, or volumes. This is not the case for prognostic variables described by (vector) proxy fields, as they depend on metric and orientation. The new structuring reveals also important geometrical features of the equations of GFD. For instance, the dimensioned differential forms display the geometric nature of the fluid’s characteristics, while the equations’ structuring illustrates how the metric-free momentum and continuity equations geometrically interact and how they are connected by the metric-dependent Hodge star and Riemannian lift. Besides this geometric insight, this structuring has also practical benefits: since equations containing only topological structure are less complicated to implement and can be integrated exactly, our results may contribute to more efficient and accurate discretizations.",Werner Bauer,GEM - International Journal on Geomathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13137-015-0074-8,"Rotating Euler’s equations,Covariant equations,Covariant split Euler’s equations of GFD,Geophysical fluid dynamics,Differential geometry, Exterior calculus"

The GCFPDT is a modified version of the conformable fractional partial differential transform introduced in our recent work and it can be used as an efficient alternative transform to find analytical solutions for nonlinear systems of CSTFPDEs available in the literature. The convergence and error estimation of the proposed GCFPDT are also considered. Moreover, approximate analytical solutions to nonlinear system of gas dynamic equations, nonlinear system of KdV equations, and nonlinear system of approximate long water wave equations in the sense of conformable space-time fractional partial derivatives are successfully obtained to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed GCFPDT.","Hayman Thabet

0,Localized Boundary-Domain Integro-partial Differential Formulations for Transient Scalar Transport Problems,"Integro-partial differential equations, though very challenging can still be solved using conventional numerical techniques. Although these problems have been severally solved, it is still noticeable how little has been said about them in boundary element method (BEM) literature. A major reason for this is that for those problems where an encounter with the problem domain becomes a necessity, BEM’s inadequacies become highly apparent. Moreover for such situations, the fundamental solution is either not available in a cheaply computable form or a considerable numerical effort is required to handle this numerical challenge. Sometimes, the fundamental solutions may exist in a form that is highly non-local and lead to system of equations with a fully populated matrix that is cumbersome to handle numerically, especially for field problems. In the work reported herein, we adopt a fundamental solution of an auxiliary form of a governing partial differential equation coupled with the Green’s identity to discretize and localize an integro-partial differential transport equation by conversion into a boundary-domain form which is amenable to a hybrid boundary integral numerical formulation. It is observed that this numerical formulation is straightforward and yields accurate results when compared with those found in literature.",Okey Oseloka Onyejekwe,International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40819-016-0235-y,"Boundary element method,Green’s identity,Complementary equation,Fundamental solution,Hybrid formulation,Integro-differential transport equation"

0, UG – A flexible software toolbox for solving partial differential equations," Over the past two decades, some very efficient techniques for the numerical solution of partial differential equations have been developed. We are especially interested in adaptive local grid refinement on unstructured meshes, multigrid solvers and parallelization techniques.
Up to now, these innovative techniques have been implemented mostly in university research codes and only very few commercial codes use them. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the multigrid solution and adaptive refinement for many engineering applications are still a topic of active research and cannot be considered to be mature enough for routine application. Secondly, the implementation of all these techniques in a code with sufficient generality requires a lot of time and know-how in different fields.
UG (abbreviation for Unstructured Grids) has been designed to overcome these problems. It provides very general tools for the generation and manipulation of unstructured meshes in two and three space dimensions as well as a flexible data layout. Therefore, it can serve on the one hand as a tool for exploring new algorithms and, on the other hand, a whole range of algorithms already implemented can be applied to complex problems.
In this paper, we show the software design structure of UG and explore some of the subsystems in more detail. Finally, we try to illustrate the capabilities of the approach with several non–trivial examples.

The boundary conditions following Thom’s formula, Jenison’s formula of second and third order and computational boundary method are applied to solve the coupled equations. The geometry for the problem is a lid-driven cavity in which the coupled differential equations are solved. The order of accuracy of the boundary conditions affects largely the value of vorticity values at the centre of the primary vortex. At lower Reynolds number these values don’t have any impact; however at large Reynolds numbers those values are affected by large amount. Sometimes the computed values overshot the theoretical value of vorticity i.e. − 1.88596 with increase of Reynolds number. For this computation the grid meshes 129 × 129 and 257 × 257 are used.

0,Vallée-Poussin theorem for fractional functional differential equations,"An analog of the classical Vallée-Poussin theorem about differential inequality in the theory of ordinary differential equations is developed for fractional functional differential equations. The main results are obtained in a form of a theorem about several equivalent assertions. Among them solvability of two-point boundary value problems with fractional functional differential equation, negativity of Green’s function, and its derivatives and existence of a function v(t) satisfying a corresponding differential inequality. Thus the Vallée-Poussin theorem presents one of the possible “entrances” to assertions on nonoscillating properties and assertions about the negativity of Green’s functions and their derivatives for various two-point problems. Choosing the function v(t) in the condition, we obtain explicit tests of sign-constancy of Green’s functions and their derivatives. It can be stressed that a choice of a corresponding function in the Vallée-Poussin theorem leads to explicit criteria in the form of algebraic inequalities, which, as we demonstrate with examples, cannot be improved. Replacing strict inequalities with non-strict ones will already lead to incorrect statements. In some cases, the well-known results obtained in the form of the Lyapunov inequalities for fractional differential equations can be improved based on ours. Another development, we propose, is a concept to consider fractional functional differential equations. The basis of this concept is to reduce boundary value problems for fractional functional differential equations to operator equations in the space of essentially bounded functions. Fractional functional differential equations can appear in various applications and in the process of construction of equations for a corresponding component of a solution-vector of a system of fractional equations.","Alexander Domoshnitsky1, Seshadev Padhi2 & Satyam Narayan Srivastava

The focus is put on a size-structured population balance equation (PBE) predicting the evolution of the number distribution of a single cell population as a function of the size variable. Since the inverse problem at hand is ill-posed, an adequate regularization scheme is required to avoid amplification of measurement errors in the solution method. The technique developed in this work to determine a rate function in a PBE is based on the approximate inverse method, a pointwise regularization scheme, which employs two key ideas. Firstly, the mollification in the directions of time and size variables are separated. Secondly, instable numerical data derivatives are circumvented by shifting the differentiation to an analytically given function. To examine the performance of the introduced scheme, adapted test scenarios have been designed with different levels of data disturbance simulating the model and measurement errors in practice. The success of the method is substantiated by visualizing the results of these numerical experiments.","Andreas Groh1, Holger Kohr2 & Alfred K.

0,Tensor Networks and Hierarchical Tensors for the Solution of High-Dimensional Partial Differential Equations,"Hierarchical tensors can be regarded as a generalisation, preserving many crucial features, of the singular value decomposition to higher-order tensors. For a given tensor product space, a recursive decomposition of the set of coordinates into a dimension tree gives a hierarchy of nested subspaces and corresponding nested bases. The dimensions of these subspaces yield a notion of multilinear rank. This rank tuple, as well as quasi-optimal low-rank approximations by rank truncation, can be obtained by a hierarchical singular value decomposition. For fixed multilinear ranks, the storage and operation complexity of these hierarchical representations scale only linearly in the order of the tensor. As in the matrix case, the set of hierarchical tensors of a given multilinear rank is not a convex set, but forms an open smooth manifold. A number of techniques for the computation of hierarchical low-rank approximations have been developed, including local optimisation techniques on Riemannian manifolds as well as truncated iteration methods, which can be applied for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations. This article gives a survey of these developments. We also discuss applications to problems in uncertainty quantification, to the solution of the electronic Schrödinger equation in the strongly correlated regime, and to the computation of metastable states in molecular dynamics.","Markus Bachmayr1, Reinhold Schneider2 & André Uschmajew",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-016-9317-9,"Hierarchical tensors,Low-rank approximation,High-dimensional partial differential equations"

First, the Genocchi polynomials properties and the pseudo-operational matrix of the VO-fractional derivative and fractional integration are presented. Then, to approximate an integral part of the problems, we obtain the dual pseudo-operational matrix of fractional order with a new technique.

Although originally only developed for ordinary equations, it has been extended to large classes of partial equations as well. In the first part Loewy’s results for ordinary equations are outlined.

High order polynomial approximations are used for both the solution and the representation of the geometry. Following an isoparametric approach, the four edges of the computational domain are first parametrized using high order polynomial interpolation. Transfinite interpolation is then used to construct the mapping from the square reference domain to the physical domain. Through a series of numerical examples we show the importance of representing the boundary of the domain in a careful way; the choice of interpolation points along the edges of the physical domain may significantly effect the overall discretization error. One way to ensure good interpolation points along an edge is based on the following criteria: (i) the points should be on the exact curve; (ii) the derivative of the exact curve and the interpolant should coincide at the internal points along the edge. Following this approach, we demonstrate that the discretization error for the Poisson problem may decay exponentially fast even when the boundary has low regularity.","Tormod Bjøntegaard1, Einar M.

The results are counterparts of earlier results by the author on local uniqueness in the Cauchy problem. We also give a necessary condition by constructing solutions with singularities. We think that the technique used here should also have other applications. Anyhow this result is a generalization of a result by Y. Tsuno related to simple characteristic hypersurfaces.

In both methods, a domain of interest is divided into two subsets where continuous-time Markov chain models and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are used, respectively.

0,Overcoming the Curse of Dimensionality in the Numerical Approximation of Parabolic Partial Differential Equations with Gradient-Dependent Nonlinearities ,"Partial differential equations (PDEs) are a fundamental tool in the modeling of many real-world phenomena. In a number of such real-world phenomena the PDEs under consideration contain gradient-dependent nonlinearities and are high-dimensional. Such high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs can in nearly all cases not be solved explicitly, and it is one of the most challenging tasks in applied mathematics to solve high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs approximately. It is especially very challenging to design approximation algorithms for nonlinear PDEs for which one can rigorously prove that they do overcome the so-called curse of dimensionality in the sense that the number of computational operations of the approximation algorithm needed to achieve an approximation precision of size \({\varepsilon }> 0\) grows at most polynomially in both the PDE dimension \(d \in \mathbb {N}\) and the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy \({\varepsilon }\). In particular, to the best of our knowledge there exists no approximation algorithm in the scientific literature which has been proven to overcome the curse of dimensionality in the case of a class of nonlinear PDEs with general time horizons and gradient-dependent nonlinearities. It is the key contribution of this article to overcome this difficulty. More specifically, it is the key contribution of this article (i) to propose a new full-history recursive multilevel Picard approximation algorithm for high-dimensional nonlinear heat equations with general time horizons and gradient-dependent nonlinearities and (ii) to rigorously prove that this full-history recursive multilevel Picard approximation algorithm does indeed overcome the curse of dimensionality in the case of such nonlinear heat equations with gradient-dependent nonlinearities.","Martin Hutzenthaler1, Arnulf Jentzen2,3 & Thomas Kruse",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-021-09514-y,"Curse of dimensionality,Partial differential equation,PDE,Backward stochastic differential equation,BSDE,Multilevel Picard,Multilevel Monte Carlo,Gradient-dependent nonlinearity"

Most of them investigate the properties of coupled systems that include one-dimensional drift–diffusion equations for describing the highly sensitive semi-conducting elements in the circuit. Here, we extend the results to coupled systems with higher dimensional drift–diffusion models that allow a proper modeling of semiconductor devices constituted of regions with different material properties. For stability reasons, we investigate a monolithic simulation approach and consider two common variants of PDE discretizations for semiconductors in the system: besides a finite element method that may be combined with the Scharfetter–Gummel approach, a mixed finite element discretization. The resulting differential algebraic equations share important properties that allow us to show that their index is always less or equal to two and depends only on the circuit’s topology. The information about the index enables us to conclude unique solvability of the associated initial value problems as well as to choose appropriate time-stepping methods for them.","Sascha Baumanns1, Lennart Jansen2, Monica Selva-Soto3 & …Caren Tischendorf2,",Computational and Applied Mathematics,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-014-0157-4,"Circuit device simulation,DAEs index,Finite elements,Mixed finite elements,Monolithic simulation,Unique solvability"

0,Study of One Dimensional Hyperbolic Telegraph Equation Via a Hybrid Cubic B-Spline Differential Quadrature Method,"Hybrid cubic B-spline differential quadrature method (in brief, HCB-DQM) have been proposed for the study of one space dimensional time dependent partial differential equations. Specially, we have applied the proposed method for 1D telegraph equation (1D TE). The HCB-DQM is based on DQM with hybrid cubic-B-splines as base functions, and so, the 1D TE is reduced to a system of first order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which is solved via SSP-RK43 scheme. The accurateness and efficiency of the proposed method is tested for four examples of 1D TE via \(L_2\) and \(L_\infty \) errors. It is demonstrated that proposed HCB-DQM produces stable solutions for 1D telegraph equation. The evaluated solutions are compared with the exact results. Also, we compare the evaluated results with existing recently published results. It is seen that the produced results are agreed well with the exact solutions.

0,Inferring the unknown parameters in differential equation by Gaussian process regression with constraint,"Differential equation (DE) is a commonly used modeling method in various scientific subjects such as finance and biology. The parameters in DE models often have interesting scientific interpretations, but their values are often unknown and need to be estimated from the measurements. Here, we develop a one-stage parameter estimation framework, which is based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, to draw the samples from the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters from the given noisy and scarce observations of the solution only. A likelihood function including a novel potential is constructed to infer the unknown parameters and the novel potential works by measuring the residual errors of both data and DE model with given model parameters. A key issue in parameter estimation problem is to robustly estimate the solution and its derivatives from noisy observations of only the function values at given location points, under the assumption of a physical model in the form of differential equation governing the function and its derivatives. To address the key issue, we propose to use the Gaussian process regression with constraint (GPRC) method which jointly model the solution, its derivatives, and the parametric differential equation, to estimate the solution and its derivatives. With numerical examples, we illustrate that the proposed method has competitive performance against existing approaches for estimating the unknown parameters in DEs.","Ying Zhou1, Qingping Zhou1 & Hongqiao Wang

0,Subordinated Gaussian random fields in elliptic partial differential equations,"To model subsurface flow in uncertain heterogeneous or fractured media an elliptic equation with a discontinuous stochastic diffusion coefficient—also called random field—may be used. In case of a one-dimensional parameter space, Lévy processes allow for jumps and display great flexibility in the distributions used. However, in various situations (e.g. microstructure modeling), a one-dimensional parameter space is not sufficient. Classical extensions of Lévy processes on two parameter dimensions suffer from the fact that they do not allow for spatial discontinuities [see for example Barth and Stein (Stoch Part Differ Equ Anal Comput 6(2):286–334, 2018)]. In this paper a new subordination approach is employed [see also Barth and Merkle (Subordinated gaussian random fields.

Existence and uniqueness of a (pathwise) solution to a general elliptic partial differential equation is proved and an approximation theory for the diffusion coefficient and the corresponding solution provided. Further, numerical examples using a Monte Carlo approach on a Finite Element discretization validate our theoretical results.

The leading coefficient a satisfies the ellipticity condition and depends on \((\omega ,t)\). The lower-order coefficients b, c, and \(\xi \) depend on \((\omega ,t,x)\). The coefficients a ,b, c, and \(\xi \) are bounded. The initial data \(u_0\) depends on \((\omega ,x)\). The unique existence of local solutions to the SPDE follows from the unique solvability of a general Lipschitz case. We prove a Hölder embedding theorem for solution space \(\mathcal {H}_p^\gamma (\tau )\) and maximum principle for SPDEs with the random fractional Laplacians to extend local solutions to a global one. The range of \(\lambda \in [0,\alpha /2-1/2)\) depending on the highest order of the fractional Laplacian is given as a sufficient condition for the existence. When \(\alpha \uparrow 2\), the condition is in accordance with the one for unique solvability of Laplacian case.

Towards fast convergence of the overlapping and non-overlapping Schwarz subdomain iterations, in this paper we firstly perform, for fixed Tikhonov parameter \(\mu \), rigorous analyses based on optimization of the convergence factor of subdomain iterations in Fourier frequency domain to give the optimized transmission parameters involved in the above mentioned transmission conditions, as well as those involved in a Ventcell-like and a two-sided Robin-like transmission condition that we propose to accelerate the Schwarz subdomain iterations, and meanwhile we obtain also the corresponding asymptotic convergence rate estimates. The results show that the Tikhonov parameter \(\mu \) occurs in both the optimized transmission parameters and the corresponding convergence rate estimates and affects the performance of the Schwarz domain decomposition methods significantly: when \(\mu \) is less than a certain threshold value, with the decreasing of the Tikhonov parameter \(\mu \), the subdomain iteration converges more and more fast, though the regularity of the system deteriorates in this process. We lastly investigate the case where the Tikhonov parameter \(\mu =h^4\) that is suggested by Benamou (where h is the mesh size). We obtain as well the optimized transmission parameters involved in the non-coupled, the partially-coupled and the fully-coupled Robin-like transmission conditions, and find that they lead to optimized Schwarz methods that are very robust in the mesh size. The analysis also sheds light on optimizing the Schwarz domain decomposition methods for biharmonic equations, since they can also be reformulated as a system of second order elliptic PDEs.

In Section 1 are defined certain algebraic notions related to the symmetric bilinear form (2iv) and which are necessary for the construction of any Galois theory. Necessary and sufficient condition for the extension of the domain of the operator Δα (this operator is not a derivation although it commutes with the partial derivations of the α-differential field) from an α-differential fieldK to a finitely generated α-differential extension field is given in Theorem 1.Section 2 defines the notion of α-differential mapping as linear mappings which preserve the symmetric bilinear form and commute with the partial derivations. The group properties of the set of α-differential mappings are discussed and the Galois correspondence theorems set up for α-differential fields.Section 3 sets up the notion of α-Liouvillian extensions of α-differential fields and briefly discusses the Galois groups associated with these α-Liouvillian extension fields.Section 4 points to the procedure for the algebraic characterization of ω-simple-α-differential field extensions by elementary solutions of the partial differential equationΔ

0,Differential equation model for central-place foragers with memory: implications for bumble bee crop pollination,"Bumble bees provide valuable pollination services to crops around the world. However, their populations are declining in intensively farmed landscapes. Understanding the dispersal behaviour of these bees is a key step in determining how agricultural landscapes can best be enhanced for bumble bee survival. Here we develop a partial integro-differential equation model to predict the spatial distribution of foraging bumble bees in dynamic heterogeneous landscapes. In our model, the foraging population is divided into two subpopulations, one engaged in an intensive search mode (modeled by diffusion) and the other engaged in an extensive search mode (modeled by advection). Our model considers the effects of resource-dependent switching rates between movement modes, resource depletion, central-place foraging behaviour, and memory. We use our model to investigate how crop pollination services are affected by wildflower enhancements. We find that planting wildflowers such that the crop is located in between the wildflowers and the nest site can benefit crop pollination in two different scenarios. If the bees do not have a strong preference for wildflowers, a small or low density wildflower patch is beneficial. If, on the other hand, the bees strongly prefer the wildflowers, then a large or high density wildflower patch is beneficial. The increase of the crop pollination services in the later scenario is of remarkable magnitude.","Pau Capera-Aragones1, Eric Foxall1 & Rebecca C.

The system has a special semilinear structure because, on the one hand, the evolution law can be expressed as the sum of a linear unbounded operator and a nonlinear Lipschitz function but, on the other hand, the nonlinear perturbation takes values not in X but on a larger space Y which is related to X. In order to deal with this situation we use the theory of dual semigroups. Stability results around steady states are also given when the nonlinear perturbation is Fréchet differentiable. These results are based on two propositions: one relating the local dynamics of the nonlinear semiflow with the linearised semigroup around the equilibrium, and a second relating the dynamical properties of the linearised semigroup with the spectral values of its generator. The later is proven by showing that the Spectral Mapping Theorem always applies to the semigroups one obtains when the semiflow is linearised.

In this paper we review the reduced basis methods (built upon a high-fidelity ‘truth’ finite element approximation) for a rapid and reliable approximation of parametrized partial differential equations, and comment on their potential impact on applications of industrial interest. The essential ingredients of RB methodology are: a Galerkin projection onto a low-dimensional space of basis functions properly selected, an affine parametric dependence enabling to perform a competitive Offline-Online splitting in the computational procedure, and a rigorous a posteriori error estimation used for both the basis selection and the certification of the solution. The combination of these three factors yields substantial computational savings which are at the basis of an efficient model order reduction, ideally suited for real-time simulation and many-query contexts (for example, optimization, control or parameter identification).

In contrast to the previously established complexity-bound \(\mathcal {O}\left( d^3\log _{2}^{q}(1/ \epsilon ) \right) \) for ReLU neural networks, we derive an upper bound \(\mathcal {O}\left( d^3\log _{2}^{q}\log _{2}(1/ \epsilon ) \right) \) on the size of the deep ReQU neural network required to achieve accuracy \(\epsilon >0\), where d is the dimension of reduced basis representing the solutions.

Some basic properties of the weak solutions to the stochastic differential equation and to the Fokker–Planck equation are investigated and the relationship between them is discussed. Under certain assumptions, the equivalence between the stochastic and the deterministic optimal control problems is proven. A maximum principle is established and necessary optimality conditions for the deterministic problem are derived. A similar result can be obtained in the case of time-independent controllers. The existence of an optimal control is proven under additional hypotheses for the deterministic problem. These results enable gaining a deeper insight into the initial stochastic optimal control problem. Some examples and possible extensions illustrate the applicability of the theoretical results.

0,On the Stability of the Zero Solution of a Differential Equation of the Second Order in a Critical Case,"AbstractDifferential equations of the form \(\ddot {x} + {{x}^{2}}\operatorname{sgn} x\) = Y(t, x, \(\dot {x}\)) are considered, in which the right-hand side is a small periodic perturbation of t, a sufficiently differentiable function in the origin neighborhood with variables x, \(\dot {x}\). It is assumed that X perturbation is of an order of smallness not lower than the fifth if x is assigned the second order and \(\dot {x}\) is assigned the third order. Periodic functions are introduced that are solutions of the equation above with a zero right-hand side. Since the differentiability of the quadratic part is bounded, the differentiability of the introduced functions is also bounded. These functions are used to switch from the initial equation to a system of equations in coordinates similar to polar. This system, with the help of polynomial replacement, is reduced to a system with Lyapunov constants. Replacement coefficients are found by partial fraction decomposition. A conclusion regarding the nature of the stability of the zero solution is drawn on the basis of the sign of the first nonzero constant. Due to the bounded differentiability of the introduced functions, the degree of the polynomial replacement must be limited. The system of differential equations for the replacement coefficients is solved recursively. The number of found Lyapunov constants is also bounded. This paper considers the in which when all found constants are zero. To study this problem, a method is used of isolating the main part of the introduced functions and their combinations as a result of the expansion of the latter in the Fourier series. The remainder of the series is assumed to be rather small, and it is shown that its presence can be neglected. The transition to the main parts instead of functions allows the lack of differentiability of the introduced functions to be compensated. In the case of such systems, polynomial replacement can be again used and the Lyapunov constant for each main part can be found. It is shown that the sign of the constant for any main part is preserved. Sufficient conditions for stability and instability are indicated.",A. A.

For ordinary delay-differential (DD) equations these behavioral problems were investigated in a seminal paper by Glüsing-Lürssen (SIAM J Control Optim 35:480–499, 1997) and in later papers by Habets, Glüsing-Lürssen, Vettori and Zampieri. In these papers the delay-differential operators are considered as distributions with compact support which act on smooth functions or on arbitrary distributions via convolution. The entire analytic Laplace transforms of the distributions with compact support play an important part in the quoted papers. In our approach the partial differential-difference operators belong to various topological operator rings \(A\) of holomorphic functions on subsets of \(\mathbb C ^n\) and are thus studied in the frequency domain, the arguments of these (operator) functions being interpreted as generalized frequencies. We show that the topological duals \(A^{\prime }\) of these operator rings with the canonical action of \(A\) on \(A^{\prime }\) have strong elimination and duality properties for \(_A A^{\prime }\)-behaviors and admit concrete representations as spaces of analytic functions of systems theoretic interest. In particular, we study systems with generalized frequencies in the vicinity of suitable compact sets. An application to elimination for systems of periodic signals is given.

0,Spectral methods for nonlinear functionals and functional differential equations,"We present a rigorous convergence analysis for cylindrical approximations of nonlinear functionals, functional derivatives, and functional differential equations (FDEs). The purpose of this analysis is twofold: First, we prove that continuous nonlinear functionals, functional derivatives, and FDEs can be approximated uniformly on any compact subset of a real Banach space admitting a basis by high-dimensional multivariate functions and high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), respectively. Second, we show that the convergence rate of such functional approximations can be exponential, depending on the regularity of the functional (in particular its Fréchet differentiability), and its domain. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency, stability and convergence of cylindrical approximations to linear FDEs. These results open the possibility to utilize numerical techniques for high-dimensional systems such as deep neural networks and numerical tensor methods to approximate nonlinear functionals in terms of high-dimensional functions, and compute approximate solutions to FDEs by solving high-dimensional PDEs. Numerical examples are presented and discussed for prototype nonlinear functionals and for an initial value problem involving a linear FDE.","Daniele Venturi

0,On the Use of ANOVA Expansions in Reduced Basis Methods for Parametric Partial Differential Equations,"We propose two different improvements of reduced basis (RB) methods to enable the efficient and accurate evaluation of an output functional based on the numerical solution of parametrized partial differential equations with a possibly high-dimensional parameter space. The element that combines these two techniques is that they both utilize analysis of variance (ANOVA) expansions to enable the improvements. The first method is a three-step RB–ANOVA–RB method, which aims to use a combination of RB methods and ANOVA expansions to effectively compress the parameter space with minimal impact on the accuracy of the output of interest under the assumption that only a selection of parameters are very important for the problem. This is achieved by first building a low-accuracy reduced model for the full high-dimensional parametric problem. This is used to recover an approximate ANOVA expansion for the output functional at marginal cost, allowing the estimation of the sensitivity of the output functional to parameter variation and enabling a subsequent compression of the parameter space. A new accurate reduced model can then be constructed for the compressed parametric problem at a substantially reduced computational cost as for the full problem. In the second approach we explore the ANOVA expansion to drive an hp RB method. This is initiated considering a RB as accurate as can be afforded during the online stage. If the offline greedy procedure for a given parameter domain converges with equal or less than the maximum basis functions, the offline algorithm stops. Otherwise, an approximate ANOVA expansion is performed for the output functional. The parameter domain is decomposed into several subdomains where the most important parameters according to the ANOVA expansion are split. The offline greedy algorithms are performed in these parameter subdomains. The algorithm is applied recursively until the offline greedy algorithm converges across all parameter subdomains. We demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and generality of these two approaches through a number of test cases.","Jan S.

We apply the isomonodromy method to represent all of these rational solutions by means of two related Riemann–Hilbert problems, each of which involves two integer-valued parameters related to the two parameters in the Painlevé-IV equation. We then use the steepest-descent method to analyze the rational solutions in the limit that at least one of the parameters is large. Our analysis provides rigorous justification for formal asymptotic arguments that suggest that in general solutions of Painlevé-IV with large parameters behave either as an algebraic function or an elliptic function. Moreover, the results show that the elliptic approximation holds on the union of a curvilinear rectangle and, in the case of the generalized Okamoto rational solutions, four curvilinear triangles each of which shares an edge with the rectangle; the algebraic approximation is valid in the complementary unbounded domain.

Relations between the wave equations of the input and the output of the generalized open systems, corresponding to the Schrödinger equation and the Korteweg–de Vries equation, are obtained.

0,Dynamical Soliton Wave Structures of One-Dimensional Lie Subalgebras via Group-Invariant Solutions of a Higher-Dimensional Soliton Equation with Various Applications in Ocean Physics and Mechatronics Engineering,"Having realized various significant roles that higher-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDEs) play in engineering, we analytically investigate in this paper, a higher-dimensional soliton equation, with applications particularly in ocean physics and mechatronics (electrical electronics and mechanical) engineering. Infinitesimal generators of Lie point symmetries of the equation are computed using Lie group analysis of differential equations. In addition, we construct commutation as well as Lie adjoint representation tables for the nine-dimensional Lie algebra achieved. Further, a one-dimensional optimal system of Lie subalgebras is also presented for the soliton equation. This consequently enables us to generate abundant group-invariant solutions through the reduction of the understudy equation into various ordinary differential equations (ODEs). On solving the achieved nonlinear differential equations, we secure various solitonic solutions. In consequence, these solutions containing diverse mathematical functions furnish copious shapes of dynamical wave structures, ranging from periodic, kink and kink-shaped nanopteron, soliton (bright and dark) to breather waves with extensive wave collisions depicted. We physically interpreted the resulting soliton solutions by imploring graphical depictions in three dimensions, two dimensions and density plots. Moreover, the gained group-invariant solutions involved several arbitrary functions, thus exhibiting rich physical structures. We also implore the power series technique to solve part of the complicated differential equations and give valid comments on their results.

As a result, in many problems the order in time will be strictly smaller than the conventional one, a phenomenon called order reduction. This phenomenon is extensively discussed, both analytically and numerically. As distinct from earlier contributions we here treat explicit Runge-Kutta schemes.

0,"Fractional differential equations, compatibility, and exact solutions","In this study, we propose the concept of compatibility between a fractional-order differential equation (FDE) and an integer-order one. For a given FDE, we obtain integer-order quasilinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that are compatible with it by imposing compatibility criteria. The criteria are constructed by considering the FDE and the PDEs. Then, using the general solutions of integer-order equations, we derive the exact solutions to the FDE. To illustrate the novelty and advantage of the method, we consider the time/space-fractional diffusion equations to show that the compatibility with the first-order PDE leads quickly and easily to the solutions obtained by the nonclassical Lie symmetry analysis. More importantly, compatibility with the second-order PDEs gives us new exact solutions to the above-mentioned fractional equations.","R. Najafi

Both Pantelides’s algorithm and Pryce’s \(\varSigma \)-method are equivalent: if one of them finds correct structural information, the other does also. Nonsingularity of the Jacobian produced by SA indicates success, which occurs on many problems of interest. However, these methods can fail on simple, solvable DAEs and give incorrect structural information including the index. This article investigates \(\varSigma \)-method’s failures and presents two conversion methods for fixing them. Under certain conditions, both methods reformulate a DAE system on which the \(\varSigma \)-method fails into a locally equivalent problem on which SA is more likely to succeed. Aiming at achieving global equivalence between the original DAE system and the converted one, we provide a rationale for choosing a conversion from the applicable ones.","Guangning Tan

The conjugate equation for the above-mentioned type of equations is also investigated. Such types of integro-differential equations are different from Cauchy-type singular integro-differential equations. Cauchy-type singular integro-differential equations are studied by the methods of theory of analytical functions. However, the method of analytical functions is not applicable for our case of super singular equations with integrals understanding in Riemann–Stieltjes sense. Here, we have used the method of representation the considering equation as a product of two one-dimensional singular first order integro-differential operators. Further, a complete integro-differential equation and its conjugate equation have been investigated. It is shown that in every cases of characteristic equation roots the homogeneous integro-differential equation can have a nontrivial solutions. Non-model equation is investigated by the regularization method. Regularization of non-model equation is based on selecting a model part of equation. On the basis of the analysis of a model part of equation the solution of non-model equation reduced to the solution of a second kind Volterra integral equations with super singular kernel. It is important to emphasize that in contrast to the usual theory of Volterra integral equations, the studied homogeneous integral equation has nontrivial solutions.

0,Approximate Analytical Solution for Non-Linear Fitzhugh–Nagumo Equation of Time Fractional Order Through Fractional Reduced Differential Transform Method,The fractional reduced differential transform method (FRDTM) is frequently used to solve linear and non-linear fractional differential equations of ordinary and partial type is revisited in the present work. The FRDTM is implemented to solve the non-linear Fitzhugh–Nagumo equation of time fractional order. The present article is more concerned to demonstrate the accuracy and rapid convergence of the FRDTM to get true solutions of non-linear partial differential equations of fractional order. The present algorithm is observed the faster convergence in comparison with the prevailed classical methods i.e. Homotopy perturbation method (HPM) and Adomian decomposition method (ADM). The 2-terms approximated result through FRDTM is compared with the exact solutions. The accuracy of the proposed method is demonstrated over HPM and ADM methods through comparison tables and error graphs at different values of space and time. The effect of different fractional derivatives to the solution behavior of the the non-linear Fitzhugh–Nagumo equation of time fractional order is shown through the graphs at \(x=1\). The present work gives wider description of FRDTM and provides approximate results in terms of convergent series. The FRDTM is quite powerful tool in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The small size of computation contrary to the HPM and ADM methods is its main advantage. The novelty of the present work lies in the study of comparison analysis of FRDTM with prevailed methods HPM and ADM.,"Pankaj Ramani1, Arif M. Khan2, Daya Lal Suthar3 & …Dinesh Kumar

In this article, for any locally Lipschitz continuous mapping between finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces, Nesterov’s lexicographic derivatives are shown to be elements of the plenary hull of the (Clarke) generalized Jacobian whenever they exist. It is argued that in applications, and in several established results in nonsmooth analysis, elements of the plenary hull of the generalized Jacobian of a locally Lipschitz continuous function are no less useful than elements of the generalized Jacobian itself. Directional derivatives and lexicographic derivatives of solutions of parametric ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems are expressed as the unique solutions of corresponding ODE systems, under Carathéodory-style assumptions.

However, fixed-point arithmetic is not natural to the type of computations involved in neural networks. In this work, we explore ways to improve quantized CNNs using PDE-based perspective and analysis. First, we harness the total variation (TV) approach to apply edge-aware smoothing to the feature maps throughout the network. This aims to reduce outliers in the distribution of values and promote piecewise constant maps, which are more suitable for quantization. Secondly, we consider symmetric and stable variants of common CNNs for image classification and graph convolutional networks for graph node classification. We demonstrate through several experiments that the property of forward stability preserves the action of a network under different quantization rates. As a result, stable quantized networks behave similarly to their non-quantized counterparts even though they rely on fewer parameters. We also find that at times, stability even aids in improving accuracy. These properties are of particular interest for sensitive, resource-constrained, low-power or real-time applications like autonomous driving.","Ido Ben-Yair1, Gil Ben Shalom1, Moshe Eliasof1 & …Eran Treister

Such a result holds for all the values of the depth parameter in a Borel set of asymptotically full measure. This is a small divisor problem. The main difficulties are the fully nonlinear nature of the gravity water waves equations—the highest order x-derivative appears in the nonlinear term but not in the linearization at the origin—and the fact that the linear frequencies grow just in a sublinear way at infinity. We overcome these problems by first reducing the linearized operators, obtained at each approximate quasi-periodic solution along a Nash–Moser iterative scheme, to constant coefficients up to smoothing operators, using pseudo-differential changes of variables that are quasi-periodic in time. Then we apply a KAM reducibility scheme which requires very weak Melnikov non-resonance conditions which lose derivatives both in time and space. Despite the fact that the depth parameter moves the linear frequencies by just exponentially small quantities, we are able to verify such non-resonance conditions for most values of the depth, extending degenerate KAM theory.","Pietro Baldi1, Massimiliano Berti2, Emanuele Haus1 & …Riccardo Montalto",Inventiones mathematicae,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-018-0812-2,"76B15,37K55 (37C55, 35S05)"

In this paper, a geometric generalization of the sphere-valued model is considered, where the solutions are supposed to take values in compact Riemann surfaces. As a main result, time-local existence and uniqueness of a solution to the initial value problem are established under the assumption that the sectional curvature of the Riemann surface is constant. The analytic difficulty comes from the so-called loss of derivatives and the absence of the local smoothing effect. The proof is based on the geometric energy method combined with a kind of gauge transformation to eliminate the loss of derivatives.

In contrast to the classical 3D-VAR formulation that penalizes the measurement error directly, we present a modified formulation that penalizes the experimentally observable misfit in the measurement space. Furthermore, we include a model correction term that allows to obtain an improved state estimate. We begin by discussing the influence of the measurement space on the amplification of noise and prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the identification of a “good” measurement space. We then propose a certified reduced basis (RB) method for the estimation of the model correction, the state prediction, the adjoint solution, and the observable misfit with respect to the true state for real-time and many-query applications. A posteriori bounds are proposed for the error in each of these approximations. Finally, we introduce different approaches for the generation of the reduced basis spaces and the stability-based selection of measurement functionals. The 3D-VAR method and the associated certified reduced basis approximation are tested in a parameter and state estimation problem for a steady-state thermal conduction problem with unknown parameters and unknown Neumann boundary conditions.","Nicole Aretz-Nellesen1, Martin A.

Both spatially semidiscrete and fully discrete finite element approximations are considered and analyzed. We use piecewise linear and continuous finite elements to approximate the space variable whereas the time discretization uses two fully discrete schemes based on the convolution quadrature, namely the backward Euler and the second-order backward difference. For the spatially discrete scheme, optimal order a priori error estimates are derived for smooth initial data, i.e., when \(u_0\in H_0^1(\varOmega )\cap H^2(\varOmega )\). Moreover, for the homogeneous problem, almost optimal error estimates for positive time are established for nonsmooth initial data, i.e., when the initial function \(u_0\) is only in \( L^2(\varOmega )\). The error estimates for the fully discrete methods are shown to be optimal in time for both smooth and nonsmooth initial data under the specific choice of the kernel operator in the integral. Finally, we provide some numerical illustrations to verify our theoretical analysis.","Shantiram Mahata1 & Rajen Kumar Sinha

0,Tensor-Sparsity of Solutions to High-Dimensional Elliptic Partial Differential Equations,"A recurring theme in attempts to break the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of solutions to high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) is to employ some form of sparse tensor approximation. Unfortunately, there are only a few results that quantify the possible advantages of such an approach. This paper introduces a class \(\Sigma _n\) of functions, which can be written as a sum of rank-one tensors using a total of at most \(n\) parameters, and then uses this notion of sparsity to prove a regularity theorem for certain high-dimensional elliptic PDEs. It is shown, among other results, that whenever the right-hand side \(f\) of the elliptic PDE can be approximated with a certain rate \(\mathcal {O}(n^{-r})\) in the norm of \({\mathrm H}^{-1}\) by elements of \(\Sigma _n\), then the solution \(u\) can be approximated in \({\mathrm H}^1\) from \(\Sigma _n\) to accuracy \(\mathcal {O}(n^{-r'})\) for any \(r'\in (0,r)\). Since these results require knowledge of the eigenbasis of the elliptic operator considered, we propose a second “basis-free” model of tensor-sparsity and prove a regularity theorem for this second sparsity model as well. We then proceed to address the important question of the extent to which such regularity theorems translate into results on computational complexity. It is shown how this second model can be used to derive computational algorithms with performance that breaks the curse of dimensionality on certain model high-dimensional elliptic PDEs with tensor-sparse data.","Wolfgang Dahmen1, Ronald DeVore2, Lars Grasedyck1 & …Endre Süli",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-015-9265-9,"High-dimensional elliptic PDEs,Tensor-sparsity models,Regularity theorems,Exponential sums of operators,Dunford integral,Complexity bounds"

0,Stability of Synchronous Slowly Oscillating Periodic Solutions for Systems of Delay Differential Equations with Coupled Nonlinearity,"We study stability of so-called synchronous slowly oscillating periodic solutions (SOPSs) for a system of identical delay differential equations (DDEs) with linear decay and nonlinear delayed negative feedback that are coupled through their nonlinear term. Under a row sum condition on the coupling matrix, existence of a unique SOPS for the corresponding scalar DDE implies existence of a unique synchronous SOPS for the coupled DDEs. However, stability of the SOPS for the scalar DDE does not generally imply stability of the synchronous SOPS for the coupled DDEs. We obtain an explicit formula, depending only on the spectrum of the coupling matrix, the strength of the linear decay and the values of the nonlinear negative feedback function near plus/minus infinity, that determines the stability of the synchronous SOPS in the asymptotic regime where the nonlinear term is heavily weighted. We also treat the special cases of so-called weakly coupled systems, near uniformly coupled systems, and doubly nonnegative coupled systems, in the aforementioned asymptotic regime. Our approach is to estimate the characteristic (Floquet) multipliers for the synchronous SOPS. We first reduce the analysis of the multidimensional variational equation to the analysis of a family of scalar variational-type equations, and then establish limits for an associated family of monodromy-type operators. We illustrate our results with examples of systems of DDEs with mean-field coupling and systems of DDEs arranged in a ring.

(k) (i.e., the rings of partial differential operators with polynomial coefficients) over a base field k of characteristic zero. More generally, based on results of Stafford and Coutinho-Holland, we develop constructive versions of Stafford’s theorems for very simple domains D. The algorithmization is based on the fact that certain inhomogeneous quadratic equations admit solutions in a very simple domain. We show how to explicitly compute a unimodular element of a finitely generated left D-module of rank at least two. This result is used to constructively decompose any finitely generated left D-module into a direct sum of a free left D-module and a left D-module of rank at most one. If the latter is torsion-free, then we explicitly show that it is isomorphic to a left ideal of D which can be generated by two elements. Then, we give an algorithm which reduces the number of generators of a finitely presented left D-module with module of relations of rank at least two. In particular, any finitely generated torsion left D-module can be generated by two elements and is the homomorphic image of a projective ideal whose construction is explicitly given. Moreover, a non-torsion but non-free left D-module of rank r can be generated by r+1 elements but no fewer. These results are implemented in the Stafford package for D=A

0,On the Stability of the Zero Solution of a Periodic Reversible Second-Order Differential Equation,"AbstractThe problem concerning stability of the zero solution of a second-order differential equation describing the periodic perturbations of an oscillator with a nonlinear restoring force is studied. In this work, time-periodic perturbations are studied assuming that the right-hand side of the equation remains the same when time is replaced with its opposite (in sign) value. It is known that to answer the question regarding the stability of such perturbations, one needs to consider all terms in the expansion of the right-hand side in series. A. M. Lyapunov called such cases transcendental as opposed to algebraic ones, where it is sufficient to consider only a finite number of terms in the expansion of the right-hand side of the equation. The problem is solved by the methods of Kolmogorov—Arnold—Moser (KAM) theory, according to which there are time-periodic invariant two-dimensional tori, which separate three-dimensional configuration space, in any vicinity of the equilibrium position at the coordinate origin of the phase plane. These tori are considered two-dimensional periodic invariant surfaces overlapping the time axis, leading to (nonasymptotic) stability of the zero solution. The problem to be solved is characterized by the fact that the unperturbed part of the equation contains a dissipative term (a term dependent on velocity) with the same order of smallness as the restoring force. The unperturbed movement is found to be Lyapunov stable if the dissipative part of the perturbation is small enough.",Yu. N.

0,On a Boundary-value Problem for Boussinesq type Nonlinear Integro-Differential Equation with Reflecting Argument,"AbstractIn the three-dimensional domain a Boussinesq type nonlinear partial integro-differential equation of the fourth order with a degenerate kernel, integral form conditions, spectral parameters and reflecting argument is considered. The solution of this partial integro-differential equation is studied in the class of generality functions. The method of separation of variables and the method of a degenerate kernels are used. Using these methods, the nonlocal boundary value problem is integrated as a countable system of ordinary differential equations. When we define the arbitrary integration constants there are possible five cases with respect to the first spectral parameter. Calculated values of the spectral parameter for each case. Further, the problem is reduced to solving countable system of linear algebraic equations. Irregular values of the second spectral parameter are determined. At irregular values of the second spectral parameter the Fredholm determinant is degenerate. Other values of the second spectral parameter, for which the Fredholm determinant does not degenerate, are called regular values. Taking the values of the first spectral parameter into account for regular values of the second spectral parameter the corresponding solutions were constructed and we obtained the countable system of nonlinear integral equations for each of five cases. To establish the unique solvability of this countable system of nonlinear integral equations we use the method of successive approximations and the method of compressing mappings. Using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality and the Bessel inequality, we proved the absolute and uniform convergence of the obtained Fourier series. The stability of the solution of the boundary value problem with respect to given functions in integral conditions is proved. The conditions under which the solution of the boundary value problem will be small are studied. For the irregular values of the second spectral parameter each of the five cases is checked separately. The orthogonality conditions are used. Cases are determined in which the problem has an infinite number of solutions and these solutions are constructed as Fourier series. For other cases, the absence of nontrivial solutions of the problem is proved. The corresponding theorems are formulated.",T. K.

Efficient numerical method is necessary to overcome the bottleneck of expensive computational cost for real-world application. Therefore, this paper proposes a scale-dependent hybrid algorithm to numerically solve multi-dimensional time fractional differential models. We employ the Hausdorff metric-based hybrid algorithm to discretize time terms of time fractional differential equations (FDEs) with variable step size, which is applicable to non-uniform time steps geological problems. Meantime, another advantage of the proposed algorithm is optimizing the computational process. The method only requires O(\(n_s\) \(n_e\)) memory and O(\(n_s\) \(n_t\) \(n_e\)) computational cost while classical finite difference method relatively demands O(\(n_s\) \(n_t\)) and O(\(n_s\) \(n_t^2\)), where \(n_s\), \(n_t\) and \(n_e\) are the number of space nodes, time steps and exponentials, respectively. Furthermore, we adopt a meshless generalized finite difference method to discretize space terms of FDEs.

Based on the unified approach proposed in Zhang et al. (Phys Rev E 78:026709, 2008), Zhang et al. (Phys Rev E 79:046711, 2009), the nonlinear absorbing boundary conditions for one-dimensional and two-dimensional nonlinear parabolic integro-differential PDEs are derived. Thus the original problem on the unbounded spatial domain is reduced to an initial-boundary-value (IBV) problem on a bounded computational domain. Secondly, a simple but efficient adaptive time-stepping scheme for the reduced IBV problem is achieved by using the fixed point method to make the finite difference approximation stable at each time level. At each time level, we also prove that the lower bound and upper bound of the blow-up time can be bounded by the numerical blow-up times of the forward and backward Euler schemes.

We show that the difference between the discrete sequence and its continuous analogue can be bounded in terms depending on the discretization of the infinite dimensional space and the contraction factor, defined by the continuous iteration. Furthermore, we show that the comparison between the finite dimensional and the continuous fixed point iteration naturally paves the way towards a general a posteriori error analysis that can be used within the framework of a fully adaptive solution procedure. In order to demonstrate our approach, we use the Galerkin approximation of singularly perturbed semilinear monotone problems. Our scheme combines the fixed point iteration with an adaptive finite element discretization procedure (based on a robust a posteriori error analysis), thereby leading to a fully adaptive fixed-point-Galerkin scheme.

Small noise, large sample and high frequency cases","We present a review of some recently obtained results on estimation of the solution of a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) in the Markovian case. We suppose that the forward equation depends on some finite-dimensional unknown parameter. We consider the problem of estimating this parameter and then use the proposed estimator to estimate the solution of the BSDE. This last estimator is constructed with the help of the solution of the corresponding partial differential equation. We are interested in three observation models admitting a consistent estimation of the unknown parameter: small noise, large samples and unknown volatility. In the first two cases we have a continuous time observation, and the unknown parameter is in the drift coefficient. In the third case the volatility of the forward equation depends on the unknown parameter, and we have discrete time observations. The presented estimators of the solution of the BSDE in the three casesmentioned are asymptotically efficient.","Yury A.

In 2015, Van Gorder (J Number Theory 147:778–788, 2015) considered the question of whether \(\zeta (s)\) satisfies a non-algebraic differential equation and showed that it formally satisfies an infinite order linear differential equation. Recently, Prado and Klinger-Logan (J Number Theory 217:422–442, 2020) extended Van Gorder’s result to show that the Hurwitz zeta function \(\zeta (s,a)\) is also formally satisfies a similar differential equation $$\begin{aligned} T\left[ \zeta (s,a) - \frac{1}{a^s}\right] = \frac{1}{(s-1)a^{s-1}}. \end{aligned}$$But unfortunately in the same paper they proved that the operator T applied to Hurwitz zeta function \(\zeta (s,a)\) does not converge at any point in the complex plane \({\mathbb {C}}\). In this paper, by defining \(T_{p}^{a}\), a p-adic analogue of Van Gorder’s operator T,  we establish an analogue of Prado and Klinger-Logan’s differential equation satisfied by \(\zeta _{p,E}(s,a)\) which is the p-adic analogue of the Hurwitz-type Euler zeta functions $$\begin{aligned} \zeta _E(s,a)=\sum _{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(n+a)^s}. \end{aligned}$$In contrast with the complex case, due to the non-archimedean property, the operator \(T_{p}^{a}\) applied to the p-adic Hurwitz-type Euler zeta function \(\zeta _{p,E}(s,a)\) is convergent p-adically in the area of \(s\in {\mathbb {Z}}_{p}\) with \(s\ne 1\) and \(a\in K\) with \(|a|_{p}>1,\) where K is any finite extension of \({\mathbb {Q}}_{p}\) with ramification index over \({\mathbb {Q}}_{p}\) less than \(p-1.\)",Su Hu1 & Min-Soo Kim,Abhandlungen aus dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universität Hamburg,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12188-021-00234-2,"

Here this approach is generalized to nonlinear ode’s. It is not based on the existence of Lie symmetries, in that it is a genuine extension of the usual solution algorithms. If an equation allows a Lie symmetry, the proposed decompositions are usually more efficient and often lead to simpler expressions for the solution. For the vast majority of equations without a Lie symmetry decomposition is the only available systematic solution procedure. Criteria for the existence of diverse decomposition types and algorithms for applying them are discussed in detail and many examples are given.

Time adaptivity is then complemented by a local refinement/coarsening strategy of the spatial mesh of a stochastic version of the ZZ-estimator. Next to an improved accuracy, we observe a significantly reduced empirical variance of standard estimators, and therefore a reduced sampling effort. The performance of the adaptive strategies is studied for SPDEs with linear drift, including the convection-dominated case where the streamline diffusion method is adopted to attain a stable discretization, and the stochastic version of the non-linear harmonic map heat flow to the sphere \({\mathbb {S}}^{2}\) where approximate solutions exhibit discrete blow-up dynamics.","Andreas Prohl

Thus the solutions give curved generalizations of such embedded orbit structures.

","We study the Darboux integrability of two differential systems with parameters: the Raychaudhuri equation (a relativistic model in \(\mathbb {R}^4\)) and a chemical reaction model in \(\mathbb {R}^5\). We prove that the first one is completely integrable and that the first integrals are of Darboux type. This is the first four-dimensional realistic non-trivial model which is completely integrable with first integrals of Darboux type and for which for a full Lebesgue measure set of the values of the parameters the three linearly independent first integrals are rational. For the second one, we find all its Darboux polynomials and exponential factors and we prove that it is not Darboux integrable.","Antoni Ferragut

0,The Method of Difference Potentials for the Helmholtz Equation Using Compact High Order Schemes,"The method of difference potentials was originally proposed by Ryaben’kii and can be interpreted as a generalized discrete version of the method of Calderon’s operators in the theory of partial differential equations. It has a number of important advantages; it easily handles curvilinear boundaries, variable coefficients, and non-standard boundary conditions while keeping the complexity at the level of a finite-difference scheme on a regular structured grid. The method of difference potentials assembles the overall solution of the original boundary value problem by repeatedly solving an auxiliary problem. This auxiliary problem allows a considerable degree of flexibility in its formulation and can be chosen so that it is very efficient to solve.Compact finite difference schemes enable high order accuracy on small stencils at virtually no extra cost. The scheme attains consistency only on the solutions of the differential equation rather than on a wider class of sufficiently smooth functions. Unlike standard high order schemes, compact approximations require no additional boundary conditions beyond those needed for the differential equation itself. However, they exploit two stencils—one applies to the left-hand side of the equation and the other applies to the right-hand side of the equation.We shall show how to properly define and compute the difference potentials and boundary projections for compact schemes. The combination of the method of difference potentials and compact schemes yields an inexpensive numerical procedure that offers high order accuracy for non-conforming smooth curvilinear boundaries on regular grids. We demonstrate the capabilities of the resulting method by solving the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation with a variable wavenumber with high order (4 and 6) accuracy on Cartesian grids for non-conforming boundaries such as circles and ellipses.","M.

Uniform regularity properties and Fredholmness of this problem are obtained in vector-valued \( {\text{L}}_{p} \)-spaces. We prove that the corresponding differential operator is positive and is a generator of an analytic semigroup. Then, via maximal regularity properties of the linear problem, the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the nonlinear elliptic problem is obtained. As an application, we establish maximal regularity properties of the Cauchy problem for abstract parabolic equations, Wentzell–Robin-type mixed problems for parabolic equations, and anisotropic elliptic equations with small parameters.","Martin J.

0,Uncertain seepage equation in fissured porous media,"Seepage equation in fissured porous media is a partial differential equation describing the variation of pressure of a given area over time. In traditional seepage equation, the strength of mass source is supposed to be deterministic. However, the mass source in practice is often affected by noise such as transformation of underground environment and geological activities. To depict the noise, some scholars attempted to employ a technique called Winner process. Unfortunately, it is unreasonable to model the noise in seepage equation with Winner process, since change rate of pressure will be infinite. As a alternative tool in uncertainty theory, Liu process is introduced to model the noise, which can refrain from the problem of infinity. Then this paper deduces the uncertain seepage equation in fissured porous media driven by Liu process. Furthermore, the analytic solution and its inverse uncertainty distribution are derived. Finally, a paradox of stochastic seepage equation in fissured porous media is presented.","Lu Yang1, Tingqing Ye2 & Haizhong Yang",Fuzzy Optimization and Decision Making,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10700-021-09370-z,"Uncertain seepage equation,Fissured porous media,Uncertainty theory,Uncertain process"

The operators which we investigate are of the form P(X, Y) where X = δx and Y = δy + xδw for variables (x, y, w) ∈ ℝ3. We find that the operators P (X, Y) are locally solvable if and only if the kernels of the ordinary differential operators P(iδx, ± x)* contain no Schwartz-class functions other than the zero function.

0,Generalized Derivatives of Differential–Algebraic Equations,"Nonsmooth equation-solving and optimization algorithms which require local sensitivity information are extended to systems with nonsmooth parametric differential–algebraic equations embedded. Nonsmooth differential–algebraic equations refers here to semi-explicit differential–algebraic equations with algebraic equations satisfying local Lipschitz continuity and differential right-hand side functions satisfying Carathéodory-like conditions. Using lexicographic differentiation, an auxiliary nonsmooth differential–algebraic equation system is obtained whose unique solution furnishes the desired parametric sensitivities. More specifically, lexicographic derivatives of solutions of nonsmooth parametric differential–algebraic equations are obtained. Lexicographic derivatives have been shown to be elements of the plenary hull of the Clarke (generalized) Jacobian and thus computationally relevant in the aforementioned algorithms. To accomplish this goal, the lexicographic smoothness of an extended implicit function is proved. Moreover, these generalized derivative elements can be calculated in tractable ways thanks to recent advancements in nonsmooth analysis. Forward sensitivity functions for nonsmooth parametric differential–algebraic equations are therefore characterized, extending the classical sensitivity results for smooth parametric differential–algebraic equations.","Peter G.

We first study the existence and the uniqueness of the solution of the fractional differential system with time delay in a Hilbert space.

The performance index of a FOCP is considered as a function of both state and control variables, and the dynamic constraints are expressed by a partial fractional differential equation. The time horizon is fixed. Finally, we impose some constraints on the boundary control.

0,An exploration of pressure dynamics using differential equations defined on a fractal geometry,"Pressure tests have been used to understand the behavior of naturally fractured reservoirs (NFRs) by establishing parameters such as permeability, connectivity of fractures, system compressibility, fracture network parameters, and others associated with the physical properties of the reservoir. The complex fracture network of a NFR produces anomalous fluid flow, which is shown by the pressure behavior at the well. A plausible model to explain this behavior is to assume that it arises from a fractal fracture system. However, to estimate the parameters that define this fractal fracture system, fluid flow models based on the modification of Darcy’s law are used. On the other hand, in this work, a fractal structure with known fractal dimension: Sierpinski gasket (SG) is proposed. The objective of this work is to solve numerically the diffusion equation on SG, and establish a comparison with flow models used in the oil industry to investigate the fractality assumption. This study is focused on the qualitative behavior of the solution of the diffusion equation defined on a SG supported by the Kigami’s theory of differential equations on fractals.","Jesús M.

second order system of hyperbolic equation with
piecewise-constant argument of generalized type. By a new unknown
functions this problem is transformed to a family of problems for
system of differential equations with piecewise-constant argument

investigate the family of differential equations with
piecewise-constant argument of generalized type in the rectangular
domain. This domain is divided into \(N\) parts, the values of a
solution at the interior lines of the subdomains are considered as
additional functional parameters, and the family of differential
equations with piecewise-constant argument of generalized type is
reduced to a family of Cauchy problems for system of differential
equations with parameters on the subdomains. Using the solutions
to these problems, new general solutions to the family of
differential equations with piecewise-constant argument of
generalized type are introduced and their properties are
established. Based on the general solution, boundary condition,
and continuity conditions of a solution at the interior lines of
the partition, the system of linear functional equations with
respect to parameters is composed. Its coefficients and right hand
sides are found by solving the family of Cauchy problems for
linear differential equations on the subdomains. It is shown that
the solvability of family boundary value problems is equivalent to
the solvability of systems composed. Methods for solving problem

pyomo.dae: a modeling and automatic discretization framework for optimization with differential and algebraic equations","We describe pyomo.dae, an open source Python-based modeling framework that enables high-level abstract specification of optimization problems with differential and algebraic equations. The pyomo.dae framework is integrated with the Pyomo open source algebraic modeling language, and is available at http://www.pyomo.org. One key feature of pyomo.dae is that it does not restrict users to standard, predefined forms of differential equations, providing a high degree of modeling flexibility and the ability to express constraints that cannot be easily specified in other modeling frameworks. Other key features of pyomo.dae are the ability to specify optimization problems with high-order differential equations and partial differential equations, defined on restricted domain types, and the ability to automatically transform high-level abstract models into finite-dimensional algebraic problems that can be solved with off-the-shelf solvers. Moreover, pyomo.dae users can leverage existing capabilities of Pyomo to embed differential equation models within stochastic and integer programming models and mathematical programs with equilibrium constraint formulations. Collectively, these features enable the exploration of new modeling concepts, discretization schemes, and the benchmarking of state-of-the-art optimization solvers.","Bethany Nicholson1, John D.

The equation that we consider appear in several models in the applied sciences, particularly physics, rheology, material science and more generally in phenomena where memory effects play an important role.

\({\mathcal{R}}\) -boundedness, pseudodifferential operators, and maximal regularity for some classes of partial differential operators","It is shown that an elliptic scattering operator A on a compact manifold with boundary with operator valued coefficients in the morphisms of a bundle of Banach spaces of class (\({\mathcal{HT}}\)) and Pisier’s property (α) has maximal regularity (up to a spectral shift), provided that the spectrum of the principal symbol of A on the scattering cotangent bundle avoids the right half-plane. This is accomplished by representing the resolvent in terms of pseudodifferential operators with \({\mathcal{R}}\) -bounded symbols, yielding by an iteration argument the \({\mathcal{R}}\) -boundedness of λ(A−λ)−1 in \(\Re(\lambda) \geq \gamma\) for some \(\gamma \in {\mathbb{R}}\) . To this end, elements of a symbolic and operator calculus of pseudodifferential operators with \({\mathcal{R}}\) -bounded symbols are introduced.

The problem appears as a limiting equation for a semilinear elliptic equation in a higher dimensional domain shrinking to the interval \((-1,1)\). First we prove that odd solutions and even solutions form families of branches \(\{ {{\mathcal {C}}}^o_k\}_{k \in {{\mathbb {N}}}}\) and \(\{ {{\mathcal {C}}}^e_k\}_{k \in {{\mathbb {N}}}}\), respectively.

This method is applicable to a wide range of systems beyond the reach of currently existing mathematically rigorous methods. As an initial application, we prove the positivity of the top Lyapunov exponent for a class of weakly-dissipative, weakly forced stochastic differential equations; in this paper we prove that this class includes the Lorenz 96 model in any dimension, provided the additive stochastic driving is applied to any consecutive pair of modes.","Jacob Bedrossian1, Alex Blumenthal2 & Sam Punshon-Smith",Inventiones mathematicae,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-021-01069-7,"Primary: 37H15,35H10,Secondary: 37D25,58J65,35B65"

0,A roadmap for Generalized Plane Waves and their interpolation properties,"This work focuses on the study of partial differential equation (PDE) based basis function for Discontinuous Galerkin methods to solve numerically wave-related boundary value problems with variable coefficients. To tackle problems with constant coefficients, wave-based methods have been widely studied in the literature: they rely on the concept of Trefftz functions, i.e. local solutions to the governing PDE, using oscillating basis functions rather than polynomial functions to represent the numerical solution. Generalized Plane Waves (GPWs) are an alternative developed to tackle problems with variable coefficients, in which case Trefftz functions are not available. In a similar way, they incorporate information on the PDE, however they are only approximate Trefftz functions since they don’t solve the governing PDE exactly, but only an approximated PDE. Considering a new set of PDEs beyond the Helmholtz equation, we propose to set a roadmap for the construction and study of local interpolation properties of GPWs. Identifying carefully the various steps of the process, we provide an algorithm to summarize the construction of these functions, and establish necessary conditions to obtain high order interpolation properties of the corresponding basis.","Lise-Marie Imbert-Gérard1 & Guillaume Sylvand

First, we observe how the associated Lorentz force acts on the vector fields in the dynamic Frenet frame or pseudo-orthonormal frame along the trajectory depending on its causality. Based on this, we characterize magnetic trajectories in respect of their Frenet apparatus. Afterwards, we present a geometrical model of hyperbolic quaternions for \(\mathbb{S}^{3}_{1}\) where we identified \(\mathbb{S}^{3}_{1}\) with a subspace of the Lie group \(\mathbb{H}\) of hyperbolic quaternions and obtain Killing vector fields on \(\mathbb{S}^{3}_{1}\) forming a basis for the concerned six-dimensional Lie algebra. We also characterize Killing vector fields along regular curves in \(\mathbb{S}^{3}_{1}\) and observe that they can be extended to Killing vector fields on \(\mathbb{S}^{3}_{1}\) (in respect of their causality) and vice-versa.

0,Linear stability of slowly rotating Kerr black holes,"We prove the linear stability of slowly rotating Kerr black holes as solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations: linearized perturbations of a Kerr metric decay at an inverse polynomial rate to a linearized Kerr metric plus a pure gauge term. We work in a natural wave map/DeTurck gauge and show that the pure gauge term can be taken to lie in a fixed 7-dimensional space with a simple geometric interpretation. Our proof rests on a robust general framework, based on recent advances in microlocal analysis and non-elliptic Fredholm theory, for the analysis of resolvents of operators on asymptotically flat spaces. With the mode stability of the Schwarzschild metric as well as of certain scalar and 1-form wave operators on the Schwarzschild spacetime as an input, we establish the linear stability of slowly rotating Kerr black holes using perturbative arguments; in particular, our proof does not make any use of special algebraic properties of the Kerr metric. The heart of the paper is a detailed description of the resolvent of the linearization of a suitable hyperbolic gauge-fixed Einstein operator at low energies. As in previous work by the second and third authors on the nonlinear stability of cosmological black holes, constraint damping plays an important role. Here, it eliminates certain pathological generalized zero energy states; it also ensures that solutions of our hyperbolic formulation of the linearized Einstein equations have the stated asymptotics and decay for general initial data and forcing terms, which is a useful feature in nonlinear and numerical applications.","Dietrich Häfner1, Peter Hintz2 & András Vasy",Inventiones mathematicae,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-020-01002-4,"Primary 83C05,58J50,Secondary 83C57,35B40,83C35"
0,Existence and Characterization of the Values of Two Player Differential Games with State Constraints,"We consider a two player, zero sum differential game with a cost of Bolza type, subject to a state constraint. It is shown that, under a suitable hypothesis concerning existence of inward pointing velocity vectors for the minimizing player at the boundary of the constraint set, the lower value of the game is Lipschitz continuous and is the unique viscosity solution (appropriately defined) of the lower Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation. If the inward pointing hypothesis is satisfied by the maximizing player’s velocity set, then the upper game is Lipschitz continuous and is the unique solution of the upper Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation. Under the classical Isaacs condition, the upper and lower Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation coincide. In this case, even if the inward pointing hypothesis is satisfied w.r.t. both players, the value of the game might fail to exist; however imposing stronger constraint qualifications (involving the existence of inward pointing vectors associated with saddle points for the Hamiltonian) the game value does exist and is the unique solution to this Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation. The novelty of our work resides in the fact that we permit the two players’ controls to be completely coupled within the dynamic constraint, state constraint and the cost functional, in contrast to earlier work, in which the players’ controls are decoupled w.r.t. the dynamics and state constraint, and interaction between them only occurs through the cost function. Furthermore, the inward pointing hypotheses that we impose are of a verifiable nature and less restrictive than those earlier employed.","Piernicola Bettiol1, Marc Quincampoix1 & Richard B.

It is a numerical scheme that utilizes a modified shape function of the conventional Moving Least Square (MLS) method to solve fourth order Integro-differential equations. Smooth orthogonal polynomials have been constructed and used as the basis functions. A robust and unrestricted trigonometric weight function, along with the basis function, drives the shape function and facilitates the convergence of the scheme. The choice of the support size and some controlling parameters ensures the existence of the moment matrix inverse and the MLS solution. Valid explanation and illustration were made for the existence of the inverse linear operator. To overcome problems of near-singularity, the singular value decomposition rule is used to compute the inverse of the moment matrix. Gauss quadrature rule is used to compute the integral at the initial test points when the exact solution is unknown. Some tested problems were solved to show the applicability of the method. The results obtained compare favourable with the exact solutions. Finally, a highly significant interpolating polynomial is obtained and used to reproduce the solutions over the entire problem domain. The negligible magnitude of the error at each evaluation knot demonstrates the reliability and effectiveness of this scheme.","O. A. Taiwo1, M. O. Etuk2, E. Nwaeze3 & …M. O. Ogunniran

0,How to adaptively resolve evolutionary singularities in differential equations with symmetry,"Many time-dependent partial differential equations have solutions which evolve to have features with small length scales. Examples are blow-up singularities and interfaces. To compute such features accurately it is essential to use some form of adaptive method which resolves fine length and time scales without being prohibitively expensive to implement. In this paper we will describe an r-adaptive method (based on moving mesh partial differential equations) which moves mesh points into regions where the solution is developing singular behaviour. The method exploits natural symmetries which are often present in partial differential equations describing physical phenomena. These symmetries give an insight into the scalings (of solution, space and time) associated with a developing singularity, and guide the adaptive procedure. In this paper the theory behind these methods will be developed and then applied to a number of physical problems which have (blow-up type) singularities linked to symmetries of the underlying PDEs. The paper is meant to be a practical guide towards solving such problems adaptively and contains an example of a Matlab code for resolving the singular behaviour of the semi-linear heat equation.",C.

After introducing the notion of uniformly semi-normalized classes of differential equations, we compute the equivalence groupoid of the class under study and show that it is uniformly semi-normalized. More specifically, each admissible transformation in the class is the composition of a linear superposition transformation of the corresponding initial equation and an equivalence transformation of this class. This allows us to apply the new version of the algebraic method based on uniform semi-normalization and reduce the group classification of the class under study to the classification of low-dimensional appropriate subalgebras of the associated equivalence algebra.

These provide an effective notion of approximate differential operators, with a strong algebraic structure. We introduce the approximate greatest common right divisor problem (GCRD) of differential polynomials, as a non-commutative generalization of the well-studied approximate GCD problem. Given two differential polynomials, we present an algorithm to find nearby differential polynomials with a non-trivial GCRD, where nearby is defined with respect to a suitable coefficient norm. Intuitively, given two linear differential polynomials as input, the (approximate) GCRD problem corresponds to finding the (approximate) differential polynomial whose solution space is the intersection of the solution spaces of the two inputs. The approximate GCRD problem is proven to be locally well posed. A method based on the singular value decomposition of a differential Sylvester matrix is developed to produce an initial approximation of the GCRD. With a sufficiently good initial approximation, Newton iteration is shown to converge quadratically to an optimal solution. Finally, sufficient conditions for existence of a solution to the global problem are presented along with examples demonstrating that no solution exists when these conditions are not satisfied.","Mark Giesbrecht1, Joseph Haraldson1 & Erich Kaltofen",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-019-09422-2,"Symbolic–numeric computation,Approximate polynomial computation,Approximate GCD,Differential polynomials,Linear differential operators"

Secondly, in each time step, only one jump is involved in the computational procedure, which again reduces dramatically the computational complexity.

The model is formulated as a differential equation with state-dependent delay, where maturity is described as a continuous variable. The maturation rate of cells may be regulated by the amount of mature cells and, moreover, it may depend on cell maturity: we investigate how the stability of equilibria is affected by the choice of the maturation rate. We show that the principle of linearised stability holds for this model, and develop some analytical methods for the investigation of characteristic equations for fixed delays. For a general maturation rate we resort to numerical methods and we extend the pseudospectral discretisation technique to approximate the state-dependent delay equation with a system of ordinary differential equations. This is the first application of the technique to nonlinear state-dependent delay equations, and currently the only method available for studying the stability of equilibria by means of established software packages for bifurcation analysis. The numerical method is validated on some cases when the maturation rate is independent of maturity and the model can be reformulated as a fixed-delay equation via a suitable time transformation.

0,Interactions between mechanics and differential geometry in the 19th century,"79. This study of the interaction between mechanics and differential geometry does not pretend to be exhaustive. In particular, there is probably more to be said about the mathematical side of the history from Darboux to Ricci and Levi Civita and beyond. Statistical mechanics may also be of interest and there is definitely more to be said about Hertz (I plan to continue in this direction) and about Poincaré's geometric and topological reasonings for example about the three body problem [Poincaré 1890] (cf. also [Poincaré 1993], [Andersson 1994] and [Barrow-Green 1994]). Moreover, it would be interesting to find out how the 19th century ideas discussed here influenced the developments in the 20th century. Einstein himself is a hotly debated case.Yet, despite these shortcommings, I hope that this paper has shown that the interactions between mechanics and differential geometry is not a 20th century invention. Klein's view (see my Introduction) that Riemannian geometry grew out of mechanics, more specifically the principle of least action, cannot be maintained. On the other hand, when Riemannian geometry became known around 1870 it was immediately used in mechanics by Lipschitz. He began a continued tradition in this field, which had several elements in common with the new view of mechanics conceived by the physicists and explicitly carried out by Hertz.Before 1870 we found only scattered interactions between differential geometry and mechanics and only direct ones for systems of two or three degrees of freedom.

0,Toward a Solution of the Active Target Defense Differential Game,"A novel pursuit-evasion differential game involving three agents is considered. An Attacker missile is pursuing a Target aircraft. The Target aircraft is aided by a Defender missile launched by, say, the wingman, to intercept the Attacker before it reaches the Target aircraft. Thus, a team is formed by the Target and the Defender which cooperate to maximize the separation between the Target aircraft and the point where the Attacker missile is intercepted by the Defender missile, while at the same time the Attacker tries to minimize said distance. A long-range Beyond Visual Range engagement which is in line with current CONcepts of OPeration is envisaged, and it is therefore assumed that the players have simple motion kinematics á la Isaacs. Also, the speed of the Attacker is equal to the speed of the Defender and the latter is interested in point capture. It is also assumed that at all time the Attacker is aware of the Defender’s position, i.e., it is a perfect information game. The analytic/closed-form solution of the target defense pursuit-evasion differential game delineates the state space region where the Attacker can reach the Target without being intercepted by the Defender, thus disposing of the Game of Kind. The target defense Game of Degree is played in the remaining state space. The analytic solution of the Game of Degree yields the agents’ optimal state feedback strategies, that is, the instantaneous heading angles for the Target and the Defender team to maximize the terminal separation between Target and Attacker at the instant of interception of the Attacker by the Defender, and also the instantaneous optimal heading for the Attacker to minimize said separation. Their calculation hinges on the real-time solution of a quartic equation. In this paper we contribute to the solution of a differential game with three states—an additional example to the, admittedly small, repertoire of pursuit-evasion differential games in 3-D which can be solved in closed form.","Meir Pachter1, Eloy Garcia

Using a Riemann–Hilbert representation proposed in Bothner et al. (Stud Appl Math 141:626–679, 2018), we study the asymptotic behavior of \(u_n(x;m)\) in the limit \(n\rightarrow +\infty \) with \(m\in \mathbb {C}\) held fixed. We isolate an eye-shaped domain E in the \(y=n^{-1}x\) plane that asymptotically confines the poles and zeros of \(u_n(x;m)\) for all values of the second parameter m. We then show that unless m is a half-integer, the interior of E is filled with a locally uniform lattice of poles and zeros, and the density of the poles and zeros is small near the boundary of E but blows up near the origin, which is the only fixed singularity of the Painlevé-III equation. In both the interior and exterior domains we provide accurate asymptotic formulæ for \(u_n(x;m)\) that we compare with \(u_n(x;m)\) itself for finite values of n to illustrate their accuracy. We also consider the exceptional cases where m is a half-integer, showing that the poles and zeros of \(u_n(x;m)\) now accumulate along only one or the other of two “eyebrows,” i.e., exterior boundary arcs of E.",Thomas Bothner1 & Peter D.

0,Conservation Laws and Potential Symmetries of Linear Parabolic Equations,"
We carry out an extensive investigation of conservation laws and potential symmetries for the class of linear (1+1)-dimensional second-order parabolic equations. The group classification of this class is revised by employing admissible transformations, the notion of normalized classes of differential equations and the adjoint variational principle. All possible potential conservation laws are described completely. They are in fact exhausted by local conservation laws. For any equation from the above class the characteristic space of local conservation laws is isomorphic to the solution set of the adjoint equation. Effective criteria for the existence of potential symmetries are proposed. Their proofs involve a rather intricate interplay between different representations of potential systems, the notion of a potential equation associated with a tuple of characteristics, prolongation of the equivalence group to the whole potential frame and application of multiple dual Darboux transformations. Based on the tools developed, a preliminary analysis of generalized potential symmetries is carried out and then applied to substantiate our construction of potential systems. The simplest potential symmetries of the linear heat equation, which are associated with single conservation laws, are classified with respect to its point symmetry group. Equations possessing infinite series of potential symmetry algebras are studied in detail.

0,Integral equations between theory and practice: the cases of Italy and France to 1920,"In 1899, Ivar Fredholm discovered how to treat an integral equation using conceptual methods from linear algebra and use these ideas to solve certain classes of boundary value problems. He formulated a theory allowing him both to unify large classes of problems and to attack several problems fruitfully. The historical literature on the theory of integral equations has concentrated largely on the unification that was afforded by Hilbert and his school, but has not throughly investigated the roots of the subject in the older theory of partial differential equations, as developed for instance by Fredholm himself but also by Volterra and Levi-Civita. By concentrating on work issuing from this older tradition, in particular on French and Italian work, the paper shows how the new theory of integral equations was enthusiastically received, especially for its fruitful applications to areas of mathematical physics such as hydrodynamics, elasticity, and heat theory.",T.

Existence, uniqueness, and continuation of solutions are shown, followed by lexicographically smooth (implying Lipschitzian) parametric dependence. The sensitivity theory found here accurately characterizes sensitivity jumps resulting from active set changes via an auxiliary nonsmooth sensitivity system obtained by lexicographic directional differentiation. The results in this article hold under easily verifiable regularity conditions (linear independence of constraints and strong second-order sufficiency), which are shown to imply generalized differentiation index one of a nonsmooth differential-algebraic equation system obtained by replacing the optimization problem with its optimality conditions and recasting the complementarity conditions as nonsmooth algebraic equations. The theory in this article is computationally relevant, allowing for implementation of dynamic optimization strategies (i.e., open-loop optimal control), and recovers (and rigorously formalizes) classical results in the absence of active set changes. Along the way, contributions are made to the theory of piecewise differentiable functions.","Peter Stechlinski

For Hamiltonian or reversible nonlinearities we also prove their linear stability. The key analysis concerns the reducibility of the linearized operator at an approximate solution, which provides a sharp asymptotic expansion of its eigenvalues. For quasi-linear perturbations this cannot be directly obtained by a KAM iteration. Hence we first perform a regularization procedure, which conjugates the linearized operator to an operator with constant coefficients plus a bounded remainder. These transformations are obtained by changes of variables induced by diffeomorphisms of the torus and pseudo-differential operators. At this point we implement a Nash–Moser iteration (with second order Melnikov non-resonance conditions) which completes the reduction to constant coefficients.","Pietro Baldi1, Massimiliano Berti1,2 & Riccardo Montalto",Mathematische Annalen,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00208-013-1001-7,"37K55,35Q53"

0,Decay Rate Estimates for the Wave Equation with Subcritical Semilinearities and Locally Distributed Nonlinear Dissipation,"We study the stabilization and the wellposedness of solutions of the wave equation with subcritical semilinearities and locally distributed nonlinear dissipation. The novelty of this paper is that we deal with the difficulty that the main equation does not have good nonlinear structure amenable to a direct proof of a priori bounds and a desirable observability inequality. It is well known that observability inequalities play a critical role in characterizing the long time behaviour of solutions of evolution equations, which is the main goal of this study. In order to address this, we truncate the nonlinearities, and thereby construct approximate solutions for which it is possible to obtain a priori bounds and prove the essential observability inequality. The treatment of these approximate solutions is still a challenging task and requires the use of Strichartz estimates and some microlocal analysis tools such as microlocal defect measures. We include an appendix on the latter topic here to make the article self contained and supplement details to proofs of some of the theorems which can be already be found in the lecture notes of Burq and Gérard (http://www.math.u-psud.fr/~burq/articles/coursX.pdf, 2001). Once we establish essential observability properties for the approximate solutions, it is not difficult to prove that the solution of the original problem also possesses a similar feature via a delicate passage to limit. In the last part of the paper, we establish various decay rate estimates for different growth conditions on the nonlinear dissipative effect. We in particular generalize the known results on the subject to a considerably larger class of dissipative effects.","M. M. Cavalcanti1, V. N. Domingos Cavalcanti1, V. H. Gonzalez Martinez

One of the challenges of implementing RSNK methods is the efficient solution of the linear subproblems, which involve the reduced Hessian. This paper explores inexact Hessian-vector products to improve the efficiency of these subproblems. The reduced-Hessian-vector products, which are required by the Krylov solver in RSNK, can be determined by solving two second-order adjoint equations. To reduce computational cost, we consider the approximate (i.e. inexact) solution of the second-order adjoints. We present bounds for the second-order adjoint tolerances that ensure the Hessian-vector product remains sufficiently accurate for inexact-Krylov methods. The bounds involve the 2-norm of the state and first-order adjoint sensitivities, and we provide an inexpensive Lanczos algorithm to estimate these matrix norms. Using numerical experiments, we investigate the proposed RSNK algorithm and compare it to other optimization algorithms.",Jason E.

0,Shock formation in solutions to the 2D compressible Euler equations in the presence of non-zero vorticity,"We study the Cauchy problem for the compressible Euler equations in two spatial dimensions under any physical barotropic equation of state except that of a Chaplygin gas. We prove that the well-known phenomenon of shock formation in simple plane wave solutions, starting from smooth initial data, is stable under perturbations of the initial data that break the plane symmetry. Moreover, we provide a sharp asymptotic description of the singularity formation. The new feature of our work is that the perturbed solutions are allowed to have small but non-zero vorticity, even at the location of the shock. Thus, our results provide the first constructive description of the vorticity near a singularity formed from compression. Specifically, the vorticity remains uniformly bounded, while the vorticity divided by the density exhibits even more regular behavior: the ratio remains uniformly Lipschitz relative to the standard Cartesian coordinates. To control the vorticity, we rely on a coalition of new geometric and analytic insights that complement the ones used by Christodoulou in his groundbreaking, sharp proof of shock formation in vorticity-free regions. In particular, we rely on a new formulation of the compressible Euler equations (derived in a companion article) exhibiting remarkable structures. To derive estimates, we construct an eikonal function adapted to the acoustic characteristics (which correspond to sound wave propagation) and a related set of geometric coordinates and differential operators. Thanks to the remarkable structure of the equations, the same set of coordinates and differential operators can be used to analyze the vorticity, whose characteristics are transversal to the acoustic characteristics. In particular, our work provides the first constructive description of shock formation without symmetry assumptions in a system with multiple speeds.",Jonathan Luk1 & Jared Speck,Inventiones mathematicae,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-018-0799-8,"Primary 35L67,Secondary 35L05,35Q31,76N10"

0,The Algebro-Geometric Method for Solving Algebraic Differential Equations — A Survey,"This paper presents the algebro-geometric method for computing explicit formula solutions for algebraic differential equations (ADEs). An algebraic differential equation is a polynomial relation between a function, some of its partial derivatives, and the variables in which the function is defined. Regarding all these quantities as unrelated variables, the polynomial relation leads to an algebraic relation defining a hypersurface on which the solution is to be found. A solution in a certain class of functions, such as rational or algebraic functions, determines a parametrization of the hypersurface in this class. So in the algebro-geometric method the author first decides whether a given ADE can be parametrized with functions from a given class; and in the second step the author tries to transform a parametrization into one respecting also the differential conditions. This approach is relatively well understood for rational and algebraic solutions of single algebraic ordinary differential equations (AODEs). First steps are taken in a generalization to systems and to partial differential equations.",Franz Winkler,Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-019-8348-0,"Algebraic differential equation,exact solution,parametrization of curves"

u = u|u|p–1, with \({m\in\mathbb{N}}\) and \({p\in(1,\infty)}\), serves as a paradigm for a large class of higher-order elliptic equations with power-like nonlinearities. In studying radially symmetric solutions of this PDE and their asymptotic behavior, it is of critical importance to understand the dynamics of the associated ODE, u
(2m) = u|u|p–1, which is the subject of the present paper. Most solutions of the ODE blow up in finite time, diverging to either ∞ or −∞. In the phase space \({\mathbb{R}^{2m}}\), the orbits of these two types of solutions are separated by a (2m−1)-dimensional manifold \({\fancyscript{M}}\), which is unordered and homeomorphic to each of the coordinate hyperplanes under orthogonal projection. Solutions with orbits on \({\fancyscript{M}}\) do not blow up or, else, are unbounded from above and from below (oscillatory blow-up). In the second-order case, \({\fancyscript{M}}\) coincides with the stable manifold of the trivial equilibrium. In the fourth-order case, which is our main focus, \({\fancyscript{M}}\) contains a two-dimensional manifold \({\fancyscript{M}_0}\) of periodic orbits.

We show that the RME with a class of large (in energy norm) initial data admits a global, smooth solution. The initial data are given by the short pulse type, which is introduced by Christodoulou in his work on the formation of black holes [10]. Due to the quasilinear feature of RME, we construct two multipliers adapted to the geometry of membrane and present an efficient way for proving the global existence of smooth solution to the geometric wave equation with double null structure. We also derive the asymptotic geometry of the future null infinity and find out a nonlinear (expanding) effect at infinity.

0,Solving the Dirichlet problem for fully fourth order nonlinear differential equation,"In this paper we study the existence and uniqueness of a solution and propose an iterative method for solving a beam problem which is described by the fully fourth order equation $$\begin{aligned} u^{(4)}(x)=f(x,u(x),u'(x),u''(x),u'''(x)), \quad a< x < b \end{aligned}$$associated with the Dirichlet boundary conditions. This problem was well studied by Agarwal by the reduction of it to a nonlinear operator equation for the unknown function u(x). Here we propose a novel approach by the reduction of the problem to an operator equation for the nonlinear term \(\varphi (x)=f(x,u(x),u'(x),u''(x),u'''(x))\). Under some easily verified conditions on the function f in a specified bounded domain, we prove the existence, uniqueness and positivity of a solution and the convergence of an iterative method for finding it. Some examples demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical results and the efficiency of the iterative method.

0,Parareal computation of stochastic differential equations with time-scale separation: a numerical convergence study,"The parareal algorithm is known to allow for a significant reduction in wall clock time for accurate numerical solutions by parallelising across the time dimension. We present and test a micro-macro version of parareal, in which the fine propagator is based on a (high-dimensional, slow-fast) stochastic microscopic model, and the coarse propagator is based on a low-dimensional approximate effective dynamics at slow time scales. At the microscopic level, we use an ensemble of Monte Carlo particles, whereas the approximate coarse propagator uses the (deterministic) Fokker–Planck equation for the slow degrees of freedom. The required coupling between microscopic and macroscopic representations of the system introduces several design options, specifically on how to generate a microscopic probability distribution consistent with a required macroscopic probability distribution and how to perform the coarse-level updating of the macroscopic probability distribution in a meaningful manner. We numerically study how these design options affect the efficiency of the algorithm in a number of situations. The choice of the coarse-level updating operator strongly impacts the result, with a superior performance if addition and subtraction of the quantile function (inverse cumulative distribution) is used. How microscopic states are generated has a less pronounced impact, provided a suitable prior microscopic state is used.

0,A Fixed Point Approach to Simulation of Functional Differential Equations with a Delayed Argument,"A computational method is developed for a family of functional differential equations in one independent variable with a single deviating argument, assumed to be a delay. These equations are mapped into a finite system of ODEs, a subsystem of which involves only the function controlling the delay. Key features include efficiency during method of steps, freedom from Jacobians and root finding techniques, and computing a continuous approximation. The nonlinear differential equations may be retarded, neutral or advanced. The method is established for state dependent delays, stiff equations, discontinuous initial history, a specific loss of monotonicity in the delay and extended naturally to distributed delays. When restricted to ODEs, the method extends naturally to PDEs; the hope is the delayed version here can eventually be extended to delayed PDEs. Conditions for convergence of the approximation are established, and results of numerical experiments are reported to indicate robustness of the implementation.","Vincenzo M. Isaia

In many interesting situations, this gives way to a priori estimates for subsolutions. We apply this regularity results to obtain the ergodic asymptotic behavior of the associated evolution problem in the case of superlinear equations.

0,Stochastic Differential Games and Energy-Efficient Power Control,"One of the contributions of this work is to formulate the problem of energy-efficient power control in multiple access channels (namely, channels which comprise several transmitters and one receiver) as a stochastic differential game. The players are the transmitters who adapt their power level to the quality of their time-varying link with the receiver, their battery level, and the strategy updates of the others. The proposed model not only allows one to take into account long-term strategic interactions, but also long-term energy constraints. A simple sufficient condition for the existence of a Nash equilibrium in this game is provided and shown to be verified in a typical scenario. As the uniqueness and determination of equilibria are difficult issues in general, especially when the number of players goes large, we move to two special cases: the single player case which gives us some useful insights of practical interest and allows one to make connections with the case of large number of players. The latter case is treated with a mean-field game approach for which reasonable sufficient conditions for convergence and uniqueness are provided. Remarkably, this recent approach for large system analysis shows how scalability can be dealt with in large games and only relies on the individual state information assumption.","François Mériaux1, Samson Lasaulce1 & Hamidou Tembine",Dynamic Games and Applications,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13235-012-0068-1,"Differential games,Energy efficiency,Mean-field games,Power control,Wireless networks"

0,The equivalence problem for generic four-dimensional metrics with two commuting Killing vectors,"We consider the equivalence problem of four-dimensional semi-Riemannian metrics with the two-dimensional Abelian Killing algebra. In the generic case we determine a semi-invariant frame and a fundamental set of first-order scalar differential invariants suitable for solution of the equivalence problem. Genericity means that the Killing leaves are not null, the metric is not orthogonally transitive (i.e., the distribution orthogonal to the Killing leaves is non-integrable), and two explicitly constructed scalar invariants \(C_\rho \) and \(\ell _{{\mathcal {C}}}\) are nonzero. All the invariants are designed to have tractable coordinate expressions. Assuming the existence of two functionally independent invariants, we solve the equivalence problem in two ways. As an example, we invariantly characterize the Van den Bergh metric. To understand the non-generic cases, we also find all \(\varLambda \)-vacuum metrics that are generic in the above sense, except that either \(C_\rho \) or \(\ell _{{\mathcal {C}}}\) is zero. In this way we extend the Kundu class to \(\varLambda \)-vacuum metrics. The results of the paper can be exploited for invariant characterization of classes of metrics and for extension of the set of known solutions of the Einstein equations.

Several illustrative applications, including the Schrödinger, wave, Klein–Gordon, telegraph, and Burgers’ models that are fully embedded in the fractal 3D space, are considered to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with other generalized methods in the literature. The obtained solution is expressed in a form of an α̅-fractional power series, with easily computed coefficients, that converges rapidly to its closed-form solution. Moreover, the projection of the solutions into the integer 3D space corresponds with the solutions of the classical copies for these models. This reveals that the suggested technique is effective and accurate for handling many other linear and nonlinear models in the fractal 3D space.

0,Differential geometry based solvation model II: Lagrangian formulation,"Solvation is an elementary process in nature and is of paramount importance to more sophisticated chemical, biological and biomolecular processes. The understanding of solvation is an essential prerequisite for the quantitative description and analysis of biomolecular systems. This work presents a Lagrangian formulation of our differential geometry based solvation models. The Lagrangian representation of biomolecular surfaces has a few utilities/advantages. First, it provides an essential basis for biomolecular visualization, surface electrostatic potential map and visual perception of biomolecules. Additionally, it is consistent with the conventional setting of implicit solvent theories and thus, many existing theoretical algorithms and computational software packages can be directly employed. Finally, the Lagrangian representation does not need to resort to artificially enlarged van der Waals radii as often required by the Eulerian representation in solvation analysis. The main goal of the present work is to analyze the connection, similarity and difference between the Eulerian and Lagrangian formalisms of the solvation model. Such analysis is important to the understanding of the differential geometry based solvation model. The present model extends the scaled particle theory of nonpolar solvation model with a solvent–solute interaction potential. The nonpolar solvation model is completed with a Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) theory based polar solvation model. The differential geometry theory of surfaces is employed to provide a natural description of solvent–solute interfaces. The optimization of the total free energy functional, which encompasses the polar and nonpolar contributions, leads to coupled potential driven geometric flow and PB equations. Due to the development of singularities and nonsmooth manifolds in the Lagrangian representation, the resulting potential-driven geometric flow equation is embedded into the Eulerian representation for the purpose of computation, thanks to the equivalence of the Laplace–Beltrami operator in the two representations. The coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) are solved with an iterative procedure to reach a steady state, which delivers desired solvent–solute interface and electrostatic potential for problems of interest. These quantities are utilized to evaluate the solvation free energies and protein–protein binding affinities. A number of computational methods and algorithms are described for the interconversion of Lagrangian and Eulerian representations, and for the solution of the coupled PDE system. The proposed approaches have been extensively validated. We also verify that the mean curvature flow indeed gives rise to the minimal molecular surface and the proposed variational procedure indeed offers minimal total free energy. Solvation analysis and applications are considered for a set of 17 small compounds and a set of 23 proteins. The salt effect on protein–protein binding affinity is investigated with two protein complexes by using the present model.

This implementation considers the statistical fields generated under the OPE multiplication by the Gaussian free field and its central/background charge modifications with a weighted combination of Dirichlet and excursion-reflected boundary conditions. We derive the Eguchi–Ooguri version of Ward’s equations and Belavin–Polyakov–Zamolodchikov equations for those statistical fields and use them to show that the correlations of fields in the OPE family under the insertion of the one-leg operators are martingale-observables for various annulus SLEs.

0,Application of a Special Form of Differential Equations to Study Movements of a Loaded Stewart Platform,"AbstractWe study movements of a loaded Stewart platform in this paper. A special form of differential equations is used (motion equations in excess coordinates are derived) to compose the motion equations. In this form, vectorial Lagrange equations of the first kind are compiled using differentiation with respect to the radius-vector of the center of mass of the system and the unit vectors (orts) of the main central axes of inertia of the moving body and with respect to their derivatives. These determine the position of a rigid body in space. The length invariance of the unit vectors and their orthogonality are taken into account as abstract holonomic relations imposed on vectors describing the motion of a rigid body. “Spurious oscillations” are some of the technical effects seen in the behavior of the Stewart platform in the equilibrium position. This reason for the system to leave the unstable equilibrium position is discussed in this paper. Such standard motion of the Stewart platform as vertical oscillations of the platform will be equally unstable. The simplest mechanism of the instability of such vertical movements of the platform is revealed in this work. We propose introducing classical feedbacks to obtain steady movement. The numerical solutions of the derived differential equations completely correspond to the numerical results obtained by solving the motion equations compiled using theorems on the motion of the center of mass and on the change in the kinetic moment when the system moves relative to the center of mass.","S.

Using our methods, one can rigorously count the number of Floquet multipliers outside a closed disc centered at zero or the number of multipliers contained in a compact set bounded away from zero. We consider systems with a single delay where the period is at most equal to the delay, and the latter two are commensurate. We first represent the monodromy operator (period map) as an operator acting on a product of sequence spaces that represent the Chebyshev coefficients of the state-space vectors. Truncation of the number of modes yields the numerical method, and by carefully bounding the truncation error in addition to some other technical operator norms, this leads to the method being suitable to computer-assisted proofs of Floquet multiplier location. We demonstrate the computer-assisted proofs on two example problems. We also test our discretization scheme in floating point arithmetic on a gamut of randomly-generated high-dimensional examples with both periodic and constant coefficients to inspect the precision of the spectral radius estimation of the monodromy operator (i.e. stability/instability check for periodic systems) for increasing numbers of Chebyshev modes.","Kevin E.

0,Analysis and numerical solution of a nonlinear variable-order fractional differential equation,"We prove the wellposedness of a nonlinear variable-order fractional differential equation and the regularity of its solutions. The regularity of the solutions is determined solely by the values of the variable order and its high-order derivatives at time t = 0 (in addition to the usual regularity assumptions on the variable order and the coefficients). If the variable-order reduces to an integer order at t = 0, then the solution has full regularity as the solution to a first-order ordinary differential equation. In this case, we prove that the corresponding finite difference scheme discretized on a uniform mesh has an optimal-order convergence rate. However, if the variable order does not reduce to an integer order at t = 0, then the solution has a singularity at time t = 0, as Stynes et al. proved in [15] for the constant-order time-fractional diffusion equations. The corresponding finite difference scheme discretized on a uniform mesh has only a suboptimal-order convergence rate. Instead, we prove that the finite difference scheme discretized on a graded mesh determined by the value of the variable order at time t = 0 has an optimal-order convergence rate in terms of the number of the time steps.

The nonlocal nature of the fractional diffusion operators makes substantially more difficult the mathematical analysis of these models and the establishment of suitable numerical schemes. This paper proposes and analyzes the first finite difference method for solving variable-coefficient one-dimensional (steady state) fractional differential equations (DEs) with two-sided fractional derivatives (FDs). The proposed scheme combines first-order forward and backward Euler methods for approximating the left-sided FD when the right-sided FD is approximated by two consecutive applications of the first-order backward Euler method. Our scheme reduces to the standard second-order central difference in the absence of FDs.

0,Analysis of segregated boundary-domain integral equations for BVPs with non-smooth coefficients on Lipschitz domains,"Segregated direct boundary-domain integral equations (BDIEs) based on a parametrix and associated with the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems for the linear stationary diffusion partial differential equation with a variable Hölder-continuous coefficients on Lipschitz domains are formulated. The PDE right-hand sides belong to the Sobolev (Bessel potential) space \(H^{s-2}(\Omega)\) or \(\widetilde{H}^{s-2}( \Omega)\), \(\frac{1}{2}< s<\frac{3}{2}\), when neither strong classical nor weak canonical co-normal derivatives are well defined. Equivalence of the BDIEs to the original BVP, BDIE solvability, solution uniqueness/non-uniqueness, and the Fredholm property and invertibility of the BDIE operators are analysed in appropriate Sobolev spaces. It is shown that the BDIE operators for the Neumann BVP are not invertible; however, some finite-dimensional perturbations are constructed leading to invertibility of the perturbed (stabilised) operators.","Sergey E.

In fact, the preliminary group classification of the 2-Hessian equation was carried out. That means, we find one-dimensional Lie symmetry extensions of the principal 4-dimensional sub-algebra of the equivalence algebra of these equations. So, we find additional equivalence  transformation on the space (x, y, z, f), with the aid of Bila’s method, and, we take their projections on this space. Then we obtain an optimal system of one-dimensional Lie sub-algebras of these equations which are generated by some vectors and presented on Theorem (5.1). Some new non-linear invariant models are obtained which have non-trivial invariance algebras. The results of the preliminary group classification  are some inequivalent equations which summarized in a table.

We prove existence and uniqueness of non-trivial steady states and study their asymptotic stability. The results are compared to those of the system without mutation.

0,"KPZ equation, its renormalization and invariant measures","The Kardar–Parisi–Zhang (KPZ) equation is a stochastic partial differential equation which is ill-posed because of the inconsistency between the nonlinearity and the roughness of the forcing noise. However, its Cole–Hopf solution, defined as the logarithm of the solution of the linear stochastic heat equation (SHE) with a multiplicative noise, is a mathematically well-defined object. In fact, Hairer (Ann Math 178:559–694, 2013) has recently proved that the solution of SHE can actually be derived through the Cole–Hopf transform of the solution of the KPZ equation with a suitable renormalization under periodic boundary conditions. This transformation is unfortunately not well adapted to studying the invariant measures of these Markov processes. The present paper introduces a different type of regularization for the KPZ equation on the whole line \({\mathbb {R}}\) or under periodic boundary conditions, which is appropriate from the viewpoint of studying the invariant measures. The Cole–Hopf transform applied to this equation leads to an SHE with a smeared noise having an extra complicated nonlinear term. Under time average and in the stationary regime, it is shown that this term can be replaced by a simple linear term, so that the limit equation is the linear SHE with an extra linear term with coefficient \(\tfrac{1}{24}\). The methods are essentially stochastic analytic: The Wiener–Itô expansion and a similar method for establishing the Boltzmann–Gibbs principle are used. As a result, it is shown that the distribution of a two-sided geometric Brownian motion with a height shift given by Lebesgue measure is invariant under the evolution determined by the SHE on \({\mathbb {R}}\).",Tadahisa Funaki1 & Jeremy Quastel,Stochastic Partial Differential Equations: Analysis and Computations,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40072-015-0046-x,"Invariant measure,Stochastic partial differential equation,KPZ equation,Cole–Hopf transform"

0,Boltzmann Equation without the Molecular Chaos Hypothesis,"AbstractA physically clear probabilistic model of a gas from hard spheres is considered using the theory of random processes and in terms of the classical kinetic theory for the densities of distribution functions in the phase space: from the system of nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDEs), first the generalized and then the random and nonrandom Boltzmann integro-differential equations are derived, taking into account the correlations and fluctuations. The main feature of the original model is the random nature of the intensity of the jump measure and its dependence on the process itself. For the sake of completeness, we briefly recall the transition to increasingly rough approximations in accordance with a decrease in the dimensionless parameter, the Knudsen number. As a result, stochastic and nonrandom macroscopic equations are obtained that differ from the system of Navier–Stokes equations or systems of quasi-gas dynamics. The key difference of this derivation is a more accurate averaging over the velocity due to the analytical solution of the SDE with respect to the Wiener measure, in the form of which the intermediate meso-model in the phase space is presented. This approach differs significantly from the traditional one, which uses not the random process itself, but its distribution function. The emphasis is on the transparency of the assumptions when moving from one level of detail to another, rather than on numerical experiments, which contain additional approximation errors.","S. V.

2) in the Unperturbed Part","AbstractIn this paper, the study of the structural arrangement of generalized normal forms (GNFs) is continued. A planar system that is real-analytic at the origin of coordinates is considered. Its unperturbed part forms a first degree quasi-homogeneous polynomial (\(\alpha x_{1}^{2}\) + x2, x1x2) with weight (1, 2), in which parameter α ∈ (–1/2, 0) ∪ (0, 1/2]. For the given values of α, this polynomial is a generatrix in the canonical form of an equivalence class with respect to quasi-homogeneous zero order substitutions into which any first order quasi-homogeneous polynomial with weight (1, 2) should be divided according to the chosen structural principles. It makes sense to reduce to GNF only the systems with different canonical forms in their unperturbed part. The constructive method of resonance equations and sets is used to write the resonance equations with the perturbations of the acquired system satisfying these equations using a formal, almost identical quasi-homogeneous substitution in the original system. The fulfillment of these conditions ensures the formal equivalence of the systems. In addition, the resonance sets of coefficients are specified, which allow obtaining all possible GNF structures and proving that the original system is reducible to a GNF with any of the specified structures. Some examples of characteristic GNFs are presented, including the GNFs with parameter α implying the appearance of an additional resonance equation and the second nonzero coefficient in the appropriate orders of GNFs.",V.

We state conditions ensuring Hopf bifurcation, i.e., existence, local uniqueness (up to time shifts), regularity (with respect to t and x) and smooth dependence (on \(\tau \) and \(\lambda \)) of small non-stationary time-periodic solutions, which bifurcate from the stationary solution \(u=0\), and we derive a formula which determines the bifurcation direction with respect to the bifurcation parameter \(\tau \). To this end, we transform the wave equation into a system of partial integral equations by means of integration along characteristics and then apply a Lyapunov-Schmidt procedure and a generalized implicit function theorem. The main technical difficulties, which have to be managed, are typical for hyperbolic PDEs (with or without delay): small divisors and the “loss of derivatives” property.

It highlights boundary and initial-boundary value problems for nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, as well as periodic parabolic problems, which are widely used in applications and are called reaction–diffusion and reaction–diffusion–advection equations. These problems can be interpreted as models in chemical kinetics, synergetics, astrophysics, biology, and other fields. The solutions of these problems often have both narrow boundary regions of rapid change and inner layers of various types (contrasting structures, moving interior layers: fronts), which leads to the need to develop new asymptotic methods in order to study them both formally and rigorously.

A new type of polynomial collocation method based on Jacobi polynomial has been studied to find the numerical solution of fuzzy singular integro differential equation in weighted space.

So, we have written the equation in terms of residual function and put the collocation points in the residual function to find the solution of the proposed equation. Also, the equation has been written in operator form. These operators help to prove the convergence of the proposed method. The convergence analysis of the polynomial collocation method has been given in terms of different types of lemmas and theorems. The algorithm of the proposed method has been given in the numerical example section, which briefly helps to understand the proposed method.

0,"An applied mathematical excursion through Lyapunov inequalities, classical analysis and Differential Equations","Several different problems make the study of the so called Lyapunov type inequalities of great interest, both in pure and applied mathematics. Although the original historical motivation was the study of the stability properties of the Hill equation (which applies to many problems in physics and engineering), other questions that arise in systems at resonance, crystallography, isoperimetric problems, Rayleigh type quotients, etc. lead to the study of L
p Lyapunov inequalities (1 ≤ p ≤ Ω) for differential equations. In this work we review some recent results on these kinds of questions which can be formulated as optimal control problems. In the case of Ordinary Differential Equations, we consider periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions at higher eigenvalues. Then, we establish Lyapunov inequalities for systems of equations. For Partial Differential Equations on a domain Ω ⊂ ℝN, we consider the Laplace equation with Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions. It is proved that the relation between the quantities p and N/2 plays a crucial role in order to obtain nontrivial L
p Lyapunov type inequalities (which are called Sobolev inequalities by many authors). One of the main applications of Lyapunov inequalities is its use in the study of nonlinear resonant problems.

In a first step we prove the existence and uniqueness for the solution of the dual linear backward stochastic differential equation. This equation has the particularity that in addition to an unbounded operator acting on the Y-component of the solution there is still another one acting on the Z-component. With the help of this dual equation we then deduce the duality between approximate controllability and observability. Finally, under the assumption that the unbounded operator acting on the state process of the forward equation is an infinitesimal generator of an exponentially stable semigroup, we show that the generalized Hautus test provides a necessary condition for the approximate controllability.

First, we refer to the Dirichlet problem for the nonsmooth coefficient Stokes system on Lipschitz domains in compact Riemannian manifolds and show its well-posedness by employing a variational approach that reduces the boundary value problem of Dirichlet type to a variational problem defined in terms of two bilinear continuous forms, one of them satisfying a coercivity condition and another one the inf-sup condition. We show also the equivalence between some transmission problems for the nonsmooth coefficient Stokes system in complementary Lipschitz domains on compact Riemannian manifolds and their mixed variational counterparts, and then their well-posedness in \(L^2\)-based Sobolev spaces by using the remarkable Nec̆as–Babus̆ka–Brezzi technique (see Babus̆ka in Numer Math 20:179–192, 1973; Brezzi in RAIRO Anal Numer R2:129–151, 1974; Nec̆as in Rev Roum Math Pures Appl 9:47–69, 1964).

These properties are used to construct explicitly the solution of the Dirichlet problem for the Stokes system. Further, we combine the well-posedness of the Dirichlet problem for the nonsmooth coefficient Stokes system with a fixed point theorem to show the existence of a weak solution to the Dirichlet problem for the nonsmooth variable coefficient Navier–Stokes system in \(L^2\)-based Sobolev spaces in Lipschitz domains on compact Riemannian manifolds.

0,IDENT: Identifying Differential Equations with Numerical Time Evolution,"Identifying unknown differential equations from a given set of discrete time dependent data is a challenging problem. A small amount of noise can make the recovery unstable. Nonlinearity and varying coefficients add complexity to the problem. We assume that the governing partial differential equation (PDE) is a linear combination of few differential terms in a prescribed dictionary, and the objective of this paper is to find the correct coefficients. We propose a new direction based on the fundamental convergence principle of numerical PDE schemes. We utilize Lasso for efficiency, and a performance guarantee is established based on an incoherence property. The main contribution is to validate and correct the results by time evolution error (TEE). A new algorithm, called identifying differential equations with numerical time evolution (IDENT), is explored for data with non-periodic boundary conditions, noisy data and PDEs with varying coefficients. Based on the recovery theory of Lasso, we propose a new definition of Noise-to-Signal ratio, which better represents the level of noise in the case of PDE identification. The effects of data generations and downsampling are systematically analyzed and tested. For noisy data, we propose an order preserving denoising method called least-squares moving average (LSMA), to preprocess the given data. For the identification of PDEs with varying coefficients, we propose to add Base Element Expansion (BEE) to aid the computation. Various numerical experiments from basic tests to noisy data, downsampling effects and varying coefficients are presented.","Sung Ha Kang1, Wenjing Liao1 & Yingjie Liu",Journal of Scientific Computing,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-020-01404-9,"Identifying unknown differential equations,Time evolution error (TEE),Varying coefficients,Base element expansion (BEE),Denoising,Downsampling"

Considering the impacts of their sessile lifestyle on both natural and human activities, extensive experimental activity has been carried out to understand how biofilms grow and interact with the environment.

Two main mathematical approaches for biomass representation can be distinguished: continuum and discrete. This review is aimed at exploring the main characteristics of each approach. Continuum models can simulate the biofilm processes in a quantitative and deterministic way.

0,The impulsive heat equation with the Volterra transition layer,"We study the Cauchy problem with periodic initial data for the heat equation, which includes a nonlocal in time integral term. This term models a fading memory effect and has the form of convolution of a nonlinear function depending on solution with a smooth relaxation kernel. The kernel contains a small parameter \(\varepsilon >0\) and, as \(\varepsilon \rightarrow 0\), collapses to the Dirac delta function supported at some given moment of time \(t=\tau \). The Dirac delta function, in turn, models a shock (impulsive) loading at the moment \(t=\tau \). We establish that the transition (shock) layer, associated with the Dirac delta function, is formed as \(\varepsilon \rightarrow 0\), and the family of weak solutions of the considered problem converges to a solution of the two-scale microscopic-macroscopic model. This model consists of two equations and the set of initial and matching conditions, so that the ‘outer’ macroscopic solution beyond the transition layer is governed by the classical homogeneous heat equation, while the transition layer solution is defined on the microscopic level and obeys the Volterra integro-differential equation derived from the microstructure of the relaxation profile.","Ivan Kuznetsov

0,"Newton’s Method, Bellman Recursion and Differential Dynamic Programming for Unconstrained Nonlinear Dynamic Games","Dynamic games arise when multiple agents with differing objectives control a dynamic system. They model a wide variety of applications in economics, defense, energy systems and etc. However, compared to single-agent control problems, the computational methods for dynamic games are relatively limited. As in the single-agent case, only specific dynamic games can be solved exactly, so approximation algorithms are required. In this paper, we show how to extend the Newton step algorithm, the Bellman recursion and the popular differential dynamic programming (DDP) for single-agent optimal control to the case of full-information nonzero sum dynamic games. We show that the Newton’s step can be solved in a computationally efficient manner and inherits its original quadratic convergence rate to open-loop Nash equilibria, and that the approximated Bellman recursion and DDP methods are very similar and can be used to find local feedback \(O(\varepsilon ^2)\)-Nash equilibria.

0,Multiperiodic Bounded Oscillations in Quasilinear Finite-Hereditary Integro-Differential Systems Convection-Diffusion Type,"AbstractThe question of the existence of multiperiodic oscillations in linear and quasilinear systems describing finitely hereditary processes of the convective-diffusion type is investigated. Hereditary processes with a finite duration are characterized by an integral term with finite difference time limits. Diffusion—the presence in the system of the second derivative along the path—is the penetration of a substance into a continuous medium (water). The first derivative along the path from the desired one characterizes the movement of matter with a moving flow of a continuous medium. The almost periodicity in time of the process is described by the differentiation operator with respect to multidimensional time and the periodicity with respect to them. Thus, the flow due to multiperiodicity, convection, diffusion, and heredity has been considered. Sufficient conditions of multiperiodic oscillations in time variables in linear systems are established: a) with exponentially decreasing amplitude when moving along the semi-axis, b) with periodically varying amplitude when moving along a closed line. The result obtained in the case b) is extended to quasilinear systems.","G. M. Aitenova1, Zh. A. Sartabanov2 & G. A.

In particular, each player has its own domain and the exit cost consists of three different exit costs, depending whether either the first player only leaves its domain, or the second player only leaves its domain, or they both simultaneously leave their own domain. We prove that, under suitable hypotheses, the lower and upper values are continuous and are, respectively, the unique viscosity solution of a suitable Dirichlet problem for a Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equation. The continuity of the values relies on the existence of suitable non-anticipating strategies respecting the domain constraint. This problem is also treated in this work.

At first, problems with upper-Carathéodory right-hand sides are investigated and it is shown afterwards how can the conditions be simplified in more regular case of upper semi-continuous right hand side. In this more regular case, the conditions ensuring the existence and the localization of a solution are put directly on the boundary of the considered bound set. This strict localization of the sufficient conditions is very significant since it allows some solutions to escape from the set of candidate solutions. In both cases, the \(C^1\)-bounding functions with locally Lipschitzian gradients are considered at first and it is shown afterwards how the conditions change in case of \(C^2\)-bounding functions.

0,Phenomenological isotropic visco-hyperelasticity: a differential model based on fractional derivatives,"The rheological equation of a standard linear solid, i.e., the Zener model, is thermodynamically consistent. Thus, it was often used as a starting point for the development of nonlinear viscoelastic models, especially for elastomers. The basic idea of this paper is a generalization of the one-dimensional fractional constitutive equation of the Zener model to large strains. To reduce the number of material parameters of differential models based on the concept of the internal variables and to avoid integral constitutive equations, we develop a differential model based on the concept of dual stress and strain tensors and their derivatives. To this end, we select two couples of dual stress and strain tensors that have been used in finite elasticity. Then we obtain two constitutive models of incompressible isotropic materials called M1 and M2. We show that the M1 model is not suitable for describing the viscoelastic behavior of elastomers. To improve the predictions of the M2 model, we assume that the material is thixotropic. Therefore, the ratio of the relaxation and creep time depends on deformation. Experimental results show that this ratio may be represented as a function of the first invariant of the Cauchy–Green strain tensor. This yields a new constitutive equation whose material parameters were identified using experimental data on relaxation loadings in the literature. Next, we show that the model is able to predict the experimental data for combined loads of tension–torsion. Consequently, the model seems to be efficient at predicting the multiaxial visco-hyperelastic behavior of elastomers. The main advantage of the current model is that it has a differential form with relatively few parameters and is mathematically convenient.","Safia Bouzidi1, Hocine Bechir1 & Fabrice Brémand",Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-015-9818-6,"Dual variables,Fractional derivatives,Identification,Relaxation,Torsion,Visco-hyperelasticity"

0,Differential Geometry Based Multiscale Models,"Large chemical and biological systems such as fuel cells, ion channels, molecular motors, and viruses are of great importance to the scientific community and public health. Typically, these complex systems in conjunction with their aquatic environment pose a fabulous challenge to theoretical description, simulation, and prediction. In this work, we propose a differential geometry based multiscale paradigm to model complex macromolecular systems, and to put macroscopic and microscopic descriptions on an equal footing. In our approach, the differential geometry theory of surfaces and geometric measure theory are employed as a natural means to couple the macroscopic continuum mechanical description of the aquatic environment with the microscopic discrete atomistic description of the macromolecule. Multiscale free energy functionals, or multiscale action functionals are constructed as a unified framework to derive the governing equations for the dynamics of different scales and different descriptions. Two types of aqueous macromolecular complexes, ones that are near equilibrium and others that are far from equilibrium, are considered in our formulations. We show that generalized Navier–Stokes equations for the fluid dynamics, generalized Poisson equations or generalized Poisson–Boltzmann equations for electrostatic interactions, and Newton’s equation for the molecular dynamics can be derived by the least action principle. These equations are coupled through the continuum-discrete interface whose dynamics is governed by potential driven geometric flows. Comparison is given to classical descriptions of the fluid and electrostatic interactions without geometric flow based micro-macro interfaces. The detailed balance of forces is emphasized in the present work. We further extend the proposed multiscale paradigm to micro-macro analysis of electrohydrodynamics, electrophoresis, fuel cells, and ion channels. We derive generalized Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations that are coupled to generalized Navier–Stokes equations for fluid dynamics, Newton’s equation for molecular dynamics, and potential and surface driving geometric flows for the micro-macro interface.

We analyze the existence and the dimension of the space of solutions, when we look for solutions which tend exponentially to zero at infinity and for oscillatory solutions which have a potential growth at infinity. This type of problems appears when we study the influence of boundary conditions in homogenization, singular perturbation problems and reduction of dimension problems. As an example, we obtain a corrector result for a wave problem in a thin beam imposing initial and boundary conditions.

To demonstrate the flow phenomena in two parallel plates of hybrid nanofluids, the Brinkman type fluid model together with the energy equation is considered.

0,Hybrid master equation for jump-diffusion approximation of biomolecular reaction networks,"Cellular reactions have a multi-scale nature in the sense that the abundance of molecular species and the magnitude of reaction rates can vary across orders of magnitude. This diversity naturally leads to hybrid models that combine continuous and discrete modeling regimes. In order to capture this multi-scale nature, we proposed jump-diffusion approximations in a previous study. The key idea was to partition reactions into fast and slow groups, and then to combine a Markov jump updating scheme for the slow group with a diffusion (Langevin) updating scheme for the fast group. In this study we show that the joint probability density function of the jump-diffusion approximation over the reaction counting process satisfies a hybrid master equation that combines terms from the chemical master equation and from the Fokker–Planck equation. Inspired by the method of conditional moments, we propose a efficient method to solve this master equation using the moments of reaction counters of the fast reactions given the reaction counters of the slow reactions. For each time point of interest, we then solve a set of maximum entropy problems in order to recover the conditional probability density from its moments. This finally allows us to reconstruct the complete joint probability density over all reaction counters and hence obtain an approximate solution of the hybrid master equation. Finally, we show the accuracy of the method applied to a simple multi-scale conversion process.","Derya Altıntan

A wave breaking will arise as soon as the initial value decay faster than the solitary waves at infinity. Therefore, the wave-breaking phenomena is studied by three different methods we provided, which extends the information of this equation. Since the presence of the weakly dissipative term, the equation loses the conservation law \(E=\int _{\mathbb {R}}u^2+u_x^2\mathrm{d}x\). This difficulty has been solved by establishing the energy inequality. The main idea of the first two methods is to construct the Riccati-type differential inequality to show that the solution of the equation blows up in finite time. The last method depends on the introduction of two families of Lyapunov functions. In addition, we exhibit the persistence results of the solution in weighted \(L^p\)-spaces.","Xijun Liu1 & Ying Wang

Here evolutionary equations are abstract partial-differential algebraic equations considered in Hilbert spaces. The catch is to consider time-dependent partial differential equations in an exponentially weighted Hilbert space. In passing, one establishes the time derivative as a continuously invertible, normal operator admitting a functional calculus with the Fourier–Laplace transformation providing the spectral representation. Here, the main result is then a regularity result for well-posed evolutionary equations solely based on an assumed parabolic-type structure of the equation and estimates of the commutator of the coefficients with the square root of the time derivative. We thus simultaneously generalise available results in the literature for non-smooth domains.

More precisely, in the present work we manage to remove the perturbative assumption on the contact angle being close to 90\(^\circ \). We establish under usual double-well type assumptions on the potential and for a certain class of boundary energy densities the sub-optimal convergence rate of order \({\varepsilon ^{\frac{1}{2}}}\) for general contact angles \(\alpha \in (0,\pi )\). For a very specific form of the boundary energy density, we even obtain from our methods a sharp convergence rate of order \(\varepsilon \); again for general contact angles \(\alpha \in (0,\pi )\). Our proof deviates from the popular strategy based on rigorous asymptotic expansions and stability estimates for the linearized Allen–Cahn operator. Instead, we follow the recent approach by Fischer et al. (SIAM J Math Anal 52(6):6222–6233, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1137/20M1322182), thus relying on a relative entropy technique. We develop a careful adaptation of their approach in order to encode the constant contact angle condition. In fact, we perform this task at the level of the notion of gradient flow calibrations.

We have designed exact and consistent nonstandard finite difference schemes (NSFD) for the numerical solution of the \(\operatorname{KdVB}(2,1,2)\) equation. In particular, we have proposed three explicit and three fully implicit exact finite difference schemes. The proposed NSFD scheme is linearly implicit. The chosen numerical experiment consists of tanh function. The NSFD scheme is compared with a standard finite difference(SFD) scheme. Numerical results show that the NSFD scheme is accurate and efficient in the numerical simulation of the kink-wave solution of the \(\operatorname{KdVB}(2,1,2)\) equation. We see that while the SFD scheme yields numerical instability for large step sizes, the NSFD scheme provides reliable results for long time integration.

Two sufficient conditions for optimality are established for the above problems.

0,Analytical Solution to Transient Convection–Diffusion Equation for Reaction at Rotating Disk Electrode Using Novel Hybrid Integral Balance-Collocation Method,"The heat balance integral (HBIM) and refined integral (RIM) methods and a novel hybrid integral balance-collocation method have been used to obtain approximate analytical solutions for the one-dimensional transient convection–diffusion problem with Robin boundary conditions that describes the transport of an electroactive species at a rotating disk electrode and its subsequent reaction at the electrode surface. Comparison of 3rd, 4th and 5th order HBIM and RIM approximations with the numerical solution obtained by finite difference shows excellent agreement (less than 1% difference) in the reactant concentration at all positions and small times regardless of the order. At large times, on the other hand, the accuracy of all these approximations becomes much poorer, particularly at distances close to the electrode surface. Thus, none of these approximations is satisfactory over the entire range of positions and times. Faced with this circumstance, we propose a hybrid method that combines an integral balance with collocation at a prescribed number of interior points. The particular formulation demonstrated in this study based on the HBIM involves a 4th order polynomial trial function which is constructed so as to ensure that the residual error is zero at 5 interior collocation points. Comparison of this approximation with the numerical solution reveals that the accuracy is improved significantly over that obtained with any of the regular HBIM and RIM formulations. The error is now comfortably less than 1% at both small and large times, indicating that this approximation is excellent over the entire range of positions and times.","Mark Pritzker

                where t is the time, \({\mathcal L}\) is a linear first-order differential operator and \(\varphi \) is a generalized q-metamonogenic function. This problem can be solved by applying the method of associated spaces which is constructed by Tutschke (see Solution of initial value problems in classes of generalized analytic functions, Teubner Leipzig and Springer, New York, 1989). In this work, we formulate sufficient conditions on the coefficients of the operator \({\mathcal L}\) under which this operator is associated to the space of generalized q-metamonogenic functions satisfying a differential equation with anti-q-metamonogenic right-hand side, when q and \(\lambda \) are constant Clifford vectors.

0,KPZ equation from non-simple variations on open ASEP,"This paper has two main goals. The first is universality of the KPZ equation for fluctuations of dynamic interfaces associated to interacting particle systems in the presence of open boundary. We consider generalizations on the open-ASEP from Corwin and Shen (Commun Pure Appl Math 71(10):2065–2128, 2018), Parekh (Commun Math Phys 365:569–649, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00220-018-3258-x). but admitting non-simple interactions both at the boundary and within the bulk of the particle system. These variations on open-ASEP are not integrable models, similar to the long-variations on ASEP considered in Dembo and Tsai (Commun Math Phys 341(1):219–261, 2016), Yang (Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation from long-range exclusion processes, 2020. arXiv:2002.05176 [math.PR]). We establish the KPZ equation with the appropriate Robin boundary conditions as scaling limits for height function fluctuations associated to these non-integrable models, providing further evidence for the aforementioned universality of the KPZ equation. We specialize to compact domains and address non-compact domains in a second paper (Yang in KPZ equation from non-simple dynamics with boundary in the non-compact regime). The procedure that we employ to establish the aforementioned theorem is the second main point of this paper. Invariant measures in the presence of boundary interactions generally lack reasonable descriptions. Thus, global analyses done through the invariant measure, including the theory of energy solutions in Goncalves and Jara (Arch Ration Mech Anal 212:597, 2014), Goncalves and Jara (Stoch Process Appl 127(12):4029–4052, 2017), Goncalves et al. (Ann Probab 43(1):286–338, 2015), is immediately obstructed. To circumvent this obstruction, we appeal to the almost entirely local nature of the analysis in Yang (2020).

0,On Boundary-Value Problems for RANS Equations and Two-Equation Turbulence Models,"Currently, in engineering computations for high Reynolds number turbulent flows, turbulence modeling continues to be the most frequently used approach to represent the effects of turbulence. Such models generally rely on solving either one or two transport equations along with the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. The solution of the boundary-value problem of any system of partial differential equations requires the complete delineation of the equations and the boundary conditions, including any special restrictions and conditions. In the literature, such a description is often incomplete, neglecting important details related to the boundary conditions and possible restrictive conditions, such as how to ensure satisfying prescribed values of the dependent variables of the transport equations in the far field of a finite domain. In this article, we discuss the possible influence of boundary values, as well as near-field and far-field behavior, on the solution of the RANS equations coupled with transport equations for turbulence modeling. In so doing, we defne the concept of a well-defined boundary-value problem. Additionally, a three-dimensional, rather than a simpler one-dimensional analysis is performed to analyze the near-wall and far-field behavior of the turbulence model variables. This allows an assessment of the decay rate of these variables required to realize the boundary conditions in the far field. This paper also addresses the impact of various transformations of two-equation models (e.g., the model of Wilcox) to remove the singular behavior of the dissipation rate (\(\omega \)) at the surface boundary. Finally, the issue of well-posedness regarding the governing equations is considered.

In conjunction with the well-posedness estimate, it is also proved that this dependence is sharp by showing that the solution map is not uniformly continuous. Furthermore, the Hölder continuous in the \(H^r \times H^r\) topology when \(0\le r< s\) with Hölder exponent \(\alpha \) depending on both s and r are shown.

In particular, we introduce and give a rigorous meaning to notions like the principal symbol of the discrete wave operator and the corresponding bi-characteristic rays. The main mathematical tool we employ is the discrete Wigner transform, which, in the limit as the mesh size parameter tends to zero, yields the so-called Wigner (semiclassical) measure. This measure provides the dynamics of the bi-characteristic rays, i.e., the solutions of the Hamiltonian system describing the propagation, in both physical and Fourier spaces, of the energy of the solution to the wave equation. We show that, due to dispersion phenomena, the high-frequency numerical dynamics does not coincide with the continuous one. Our analysis holds for the class \(C^{0,1}(\mathbb {R})\) of globally Lipschitz coefficients and non-uniform grids obtained by means of \(C^{1,1}(\mathbb {R})\)-diffeomorphic transformations of a uniform one. We also present several numerical simulations that confirm the predicted paths of the space–time projections of the bi-characteristic rays. Based on the theoretical analysis and simulations, we describe some of the pathological phenomena that these rays might exhibit as, for example, their reflection before touching the boundary of the space domain.

0,A comparative investigation of certain difference equations and related differential equations: Implications for model-building,"Many mathematical models for physical and biological problems have been and will be built in the form of differential equations or systems of such equations. With the advent of digital computers one has been able to find (approximate) solutions for equations that used to be intractable. Many of the mathematical techniques used in this area amount to replacing the given differential equations by appropriate difference equations, so that extensive research has been done into how to choose appropriate difference equations whose solutions are “good” approximations to the solutions of the given differential equations.The present paper investigates a different, although related problem. For many physical and biological phenomena the “continuum” type of thinking, that is at the basis of any differential equation, is not natural to the phenomenon, but rather constitutes an approximation to a basically discrete situation: in much work of this type the “infinitesimal step lengths” handled in the reasoning which leads up to the differential equation, are not really thought of as infinitesimally small, but as finite; yet, in the last stage of such reasoning, where the differential equation rises from the differentials, these “infinitesimal” step lengths are allowed to go to zero: that is where the above-mentioned approximation comes in. Under this kind of circumstances, it seems more natural tobuild themodel as adiscrete difference equation (recurrence relation) from the start, without going through the painful, doubly approximative process of first, during the modeling stage, finding a differential equation to approximate a basically discrete situation, and then, for numerical computing purposes, approximating that differential equation by a difference scheme.The paper pursues this idea for some simple examples, where the old differential equation, though approximative in principle, had been at least qualitatively successful in describing certain phenomena, and shows that this idea, though plausible and sound in itself, does encounter some difficulties. The reason is that each differential equation, as it is set up in the way familiar to theoretical physicists and biologists, does correspond to a plethora of discrete difference equations, all of which in the limit (as step length→0) yield the same differential equation, but whose solutions, for not too small step length, are often widely different, some of them being quite irregular. The disturbing thing is that all these difference equations seem to adequately represent the same (physical or biological) reasoning as the differential equation in question. So, in order to choose the “right” difference equation, one may need to draw upon more detailed (physical or) biological considerations. All this does not say that one should not prefer discrete models for phenomena that seem to call for them; but only that their pursuit may require additional (physical or) biological refinement and insight.The paper also investigates some mathematical problems related to the fact of many difference equations being associated with one differential equation.",H.

Assuming periodic boundary conditions, the standard approach consists of semi-discretisation with a spectral method, followed by an exponential splitting.

Our analysis commences with the investigation of the free Lie algebra generated by differentiation and by multiplication with the interaction potential: it turns out that this algebra possesses a structure which renders it amenable to a very effective form of asymptotic splitting: exponential splitting where consecutive terms are scaled by increasing powers of the small parameter. This leads to methods which attain high spatial and temporal accuracy and whose cost scales as \({\mathcal {O}}\!\left( M\log M\right) \), where \(M\) is the number of degrees of freedom in the discretisation.","Philipp Bader1, Arieh Iserles2, Karolina Kropielnicka2,3 & …Pranav Singh",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-013-9182-8,"Semiclassical Schrödinger equation,Exponential splittings,Zassenhaus splitting,Spectral collocation,Krylov subspace methods"

In this work, we carry out several qualitative studies (including the use of Sturm sequences for obtaining conditions on bifurcations) on the differential equation model with a time delay in Ref. Colijn et al., J Theor Biol 247, 765–774 (2007), and explicitly obtain threshold conditions for disease eradication as well as existence of bifurcations depending on a critical delay value which characterize the duration of fast latency. Further analysis showed the existence of a transcritical bifurcation when the reproduction number was less than one with the disease-free equilibrium co-existing with just one endemic state that was shown to be stable; the period of fast latency and the reinfection progression rate were shown to be very significant in the dynamics of the disease viz a viz the individuals who progressed to active TB within 5 years of their infection.",D.

But as is well known, three-dimensional Rossby solitary waves are more suitable for real ocean and atmosphere conditions. In this paper, using multiscale and perturbation expansion method, a new Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK)-Burgers equation is derived to describe three-dimensional Rossby solitary waves that propagate in a plane. By analyzing the equation we obtain the conservation laws of three-dimensional Rossby solitary waves. Based on the sine-cosine method, we give the classical solitary wave solutions of the ZK equation; on the other hand, by the Hirota method we also obtain the rational solutions, which are similar to the solutions of the Benjamin-Ono (BO) equation, the solutions of which can describe the algebraic solitary waves. The rational solutions of the ZK equations are worth of attention.

0,On the Computation of Approximate Solution to Ordinary Differential Equations by the Chebyshev Series Method and Estimation of Its Error,AbstractAn approximate method for solving the Cauchy problem for nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equations is considered. The method is based on using the shifted Chebyshev series and a Markov quadrature formula. Some approaches are given to estimate the error of an approximate solution expressed by a partial sum of a certain order series. The error is estimated using the second approximation of the solution expressed by a partial sum of a higher order series. An algorithm for partitioning the integration interval into elementary subintervals to ensure the computation of the solution with a prescribed accuracy is constructed on the basis of the proposed approaches to error estimation.,O.

These Sinc points are defined by a conformal map and when mixed with the polynomial interpolation, it yields an accurate approximation. The first step to solve SPDE is to use stochastic Galerkin method in conjunction with polynomial chaos, which implies a system of deterministic partial differential equations to be solved. The main difficulty is the higher dimensionality of the resulting system of partial differential equations. The idea here is to solve this system using a small number of collocation points in space. This collocation technique is called Poly-Sinc and is used for the first time to solve high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations.

The special feature is that the only information available to the investor is the one generated by the asset prices, and the unobservable processes will be modeled by stochastic differential equations. Using the change of measure techniques, the partial observation context can be transformed into a full information context such that coefficients depend only on past history of observed prices (filter processes). Adapting the stochastic non-linear filtering, we show that under some assumptions on the model coefficients, the estimation of the filters depend on a priori models for the trend and the stochastic volatility. Moreover, these filters satisfy a stochastic partial differential equations named “Kushner–Stratonovich equations”. Using the martingale duality approach in this partially observed incomplete model, we can characterize the value function and the optimal portfolio. The main result here is that, for power and logarithmic utility, the dual value function associated to the martingale approach can be expressed, via the dynamic programming approach, in terms of the solution to a semilinear partial differential equation which depends on the filters estimate and the volatility. We illustrate our results with some examples of stochastic volatility models popular in the financial literature.",Dalia Ibrahim1 & Frédéric Abergel,Mathematical Methods of Operations Research,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00186-017-0609-x,"Partial information,Stochastic volatility,Utility maximization,Martingale duality method,Non-linear filtering,Kushner–Stratonovich equations,Semilinear partial differential equation"

Under some growth conditions imposed on the nonlinear term, we obtain explicit ranges of values of parameters with which the problem has a positive solution and has no positive solution, respectively.

0,"Floer Homologies, with Applications","Floer invented his theory in the mid eighties in order to prove the Arnol’d conjectures on the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms and Lagrangian intersections. Over the last thirty years, many versions of Floer homology have been constructed. In symplectic and contact dynamics and geometry they have become a principal tool, with applications that go far beyond the Arnol’d conjectures: The proof of the Conley conjecture and of many instances of the Weinstein conjecture, rigidity results on Lagrangian submanifolds and on the group of symplectomorphisms, lower bounds for the topological entropy of Reeb flows and obstructions to symplectic embeddings are just some of the applications of Floer’s seminal ideas. Other Floer homologies are of topological nature. Among their applications are Property P for knots and the construction of compact topological manifolds of dimension greater than five that are not triangulable.This is by no means a comprehensive survey on the presently known Floer homologies and their applications. Such a survey would take several hundred pages. We just describe some of the most classical versions and applications, together with the results that we know or like best.

0,Symmetry-Based Algorithms for Invertible Mappings of Polynomially Nonlinear PDE to Linear PDE,"This paper is a sequel to our previous work where we introduced the MapDE algorithm to determine the existence of analytic invertible mappings of an input (source) differential polynomial system (DPS) to a specific target DPS, and sometimes by heuristic integration an explicit form of the mapping. A particular feature was to exploit the Lie symmetry invariance algebra of the source without integrating its equations, to facilitate MapDE, making algorithmic an approach initiated by Bluman and Kumei. In applications, however, the explicit form of a target DPS is not available, and a more important question is, can the source be mapped to a more tractable class? We extend MapDE to determine if a source nonlinear DPS can be mapped to a linear differential system. MapDE applies differential-elimination completion algorithms to the various over-determined DPS by applying a finite number of differentiations and eliminations to complete them to a form for which an existence-uniqueness theorem is available, enabling the existence of the linearization to be determined among other applications. The methods combine aspects of the Bluman–Kumei mapping approach with techniques introduced by Lyakhov, Gerdt and Michels for the determination of exact linearizations of ODE. The Bluman–Kumei approach for PDE focuses on the fact that such linearizable systems must admit a usually infinite Lie sub-pseudogroup corresponding to the linear superposition of solutions in the target. In contrast, Lyakhov et al. focus on ODE and properties of the so-called derived sub-algebra of the (finite) dimensional Lie algebra of symmetries of the ODE. Examples are given to illustrate the approach, and a heuristic integration method sometimes gives explicit forms of the maps. We also illustrate the powerful maximal symmetry groups facility as a natural tool to be used in conjunction with MapDE.","Zahra Mohammadi1, Gregory J. Reid1 & S.-L.

0,Rough sound waves in 3D compressible Euler flow with vorticity,"We prove a series of intimately related results tied to the regularity and geometry of solutions to the 3D compressible Euler equations. The results concern “general” solutions, which can have nontrivial vorticity and entropy. Our geo-analytic framework exploits and reveals additional virtues of a recent new formulation of the equations, which decomposed the flow into a geometric “(sound) wave-part” coupled to a “transport-div-curl-part” (transport-part for short), with both parts exhibiting remarkable properties. Our main result is that the time of existence can be controlled in terms of the \(H^{2^+}(\mathbb {R}^3)\)-norm of the wave-part of the initial data and various Sobolev and Hölder norms of the transport-part of the initial data, the latter comprising the initial vorticity and entropy. The wave-part regularity assumptions are optimal in the scale of Sobolev spaces: Lindblad (Math Res Lett 5(5):605–622, 1998) showed that shock singularities can instantly form if one only assumes a bound for the \(H^2(\mathbb {R}^3)\)-norm of the wave-part of the initial data. Our proof relies on the assumption that the transport-part of the initial data is more regular than the wave-part, and we show that the additional regularity is propagated by the flow, even though the transport-part of the flow is deeply coupled to the rougher wave-part. To implement our approach, we derive several results of independent interest: (i) sharp estimates for the acoustic geometry, which in particular capture how the vorticity and entropy affect the Ricci curvature of the acoustical metric and therefore, via Raychaudhuri’s equation, influence the evolution of the geometry of acoustic null hypersurfaces, i.e., sound cones; (ii) Strichartz estimates for quasilinear sound waves coupled to vorticity and entropy; and (iii) Schauder estimates for the transport-div-curl-part. Compared to previous works on low regularity, the main new features of the paper are that the quasilinear PDE systems under study exhibit multiple speeds of propagation and that elliptic estimates for various components of the fluid are needed, both to avoid loss of regularity and to gain space-time integrability.","Marcelo M.

We formulate a current-valued solution of the Euler–Arnold equation with a regular-singular decomposition. For the solution, we first prove that, if the singular part of the vorticity is given by a linear combination of delta functions centered at \(q_n(t)\) for \(n=1,\ldots ,N\), \(q_n(t)\) is a solution of the point vortex equation. Conversely, we next prove that, if \(q_n(t)\) is a solution of the point vortex equation for \(n=1,\ldots ,N\), there exists a current-valued solution of the Euler–Arnold equation with a regular-singular decomposition such that the singular part of the vorticity is given by a linear combination of delta functions centered at \(q_n(t)\). As a corollary, we generalize the Bernoulli law to the case where the flow field is a curved surface and where the presence of point vortices is taken into account. From the viewpoint of the application, the mathematical justification is of significance since the point vortex dynamics in the rotational vector field on the unit sphere is regarded as a mathematical model of geophysical flow in order to take effect of the Coriolis force on inviscid flows into consideration.","Yuuki Shimizu

The advantage of this method is its simple and trusty procedure, it solves the equations straightforward and directly without requiring large computational work, perturbations or linearization, and enlarges the domain of convergence, and leads to the exact solution. Also, to validate the reliability and efficiency of the method, some examples and numerical results are provided.","Seyyedeh Roodabeh Moosavi Noori

0,On the Operator Splitting and Integral Equation Preconditioned Deferred Correction Methods for the “Good” Boussinesq Equation,"We study two numerical methods for the “Good” Boussinesq (GB) equation. Both methods are designed to solve the spatial-temporal pseudo-spectral collocation formulations of the GB equation using the deferred correction methods in one time marching step, where the Fourier series based pseudo-spectral formulation is applied in the spatial direction. The main idea is to iteratively apply a low order method to solve an error equation and refine the provisional solutions until they converge to the high order pseudo-spectral solutions both in space and time. In the first method, an operator splitting approach is introduced as the low order preconditioner in the deferred correction procedure for the temporal Gauss collocation formulation of the original GB equation. The method shows good numerical properties when the deferred correction procedure is convergent and the accuracy requirement is achievable. However, due to the stiffness of the linear differential operators, the Krylov deferred correction (KDC) method has to be applied in order to make the iterations converge. And also, due to the spectral differentiation operator involved, the condition number of the algorithm scales as \(O(N^4)\), where N is the number of Fourier terms in the spatial direction. To improve the numerical stability and efficiency, an integral equation approach is applied to “precondition” the GB equation in the second proposed numerical method, by inverting the linear terms of the GB equation analytically. As the nonlinear term of the GB equation is non-stiff, the simple forward Euler’s method preconditioned spectral deferred correction (SDC) iterations converge more efficiently than existing Jacobian-Free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) based KDC implementations, and the condition number of the new formulation is O(1), which leads to a machine precision accuracy at each discrete time step.","Cheng Zhang1, Jingfang Huang

That study has been a source for modern research in the dynamic of traveling wave solutions of different type and it has been disseminated through publication of scientific articles and/or books. Here, we provide the reader with information about current research in stability theory for nonlinear dispersive equations and possible developments. Also, I hope it inspires future developments in this important and fascinating subject. In this manuscript we consider the following topics: stability theory of solitary waves and the applicability of the concentration–compactness principle, the existence and orbital (in)stability of periodic traveling wave solutions for nonlinear dispersive models, nonlinear Schrödinger and Korteweg–de Vries models on star-shaped metric graphs. The use of tools of the theory of spaces of Hilbert, the spectral theory for unbounded self-adjoint operators, Sturm–Liouville’s theory, variational methods, analytic perturbation theory of operators, and the extension theory of symmetric operators are pieces fundamental in our study. The methods presented in this manuscript have prospect for the study of the dynamic of solutions for nonlinear evolution equations around of different traveling waves profiles which may appear in non-standard environments such as star-shaped metric graphs.

We then prove that under this mild assumption the process Z solves in the strong sense a related stochastic differential inequality.

0,Linear stability of compressible vortex sheets in 2D elastodynamics: variable coefficients,"The linear stability with variable coefficients of the vortex sheets for the two-dimensional compressible elastic flows is studied. As in our earlier work (Chen et al. in Adv Math 311:18–60, 2017b) on the linear stability with constant coefficients, the problem has a free boundary which is characteristic, and also the Kreiss–Lopatinskii condition is not uniformly satisfied. In addition, the roots of the Lopatinskii determinant of the para-linearized system may coincide with the poles of the system. Such a new collapsing phenomenon causes serious difficulties when applying the bicharacteristic extension method of Coulombel (SIAM J Math Anal 34(1):142–172, 2002; Ann Inst H Poincaré Anal Non Linéaire 21(4):401–443, 2004) and Coulombel and Secchi (Indiana Univ Math J 53(4):941–1012, 2004). Motivated by our method introduced in the constant-coefficient case (Adv Math 311:18–60, 2017b), we perform an upper triangularization to the para-linearized system to separate the outgoing mode into a closed form where the outgoing mode only appears at the leading order. This procedure results in a gain of regularity for the outgoing mode, which allows us to overcome the loss of regularity of the characteristic components at the poles and hence to close all the energy estimates. We find that, analogous to the constant-coefficient case, elasticity generates notable stabilization effects, and there are additional stable subsonic regions compared with the isentropic Euler flows. Moreover, since our method does not rely on the construction of the characterisic curves, it can also be applied to other fluid models such as the non-isentropic Euler equations and the MHD equations.","Robin Ming Chen1, Jilong Hu1 & Dehua Wang",Mathematische Annalen,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00208-018-01798-w,"35Q31,35Q35,74F10,76E17,76N99"

The Kolmogorov equation is a partial differential equation with coefficients determined by the corresponding SDE. Time-fractional Kolmogorov-type equations are used to model complex processes in many fields. However, the class of SDEs that is associated with these equations is unknown except in a few special cases.

0,Tracing Multiple Solution Branches for Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations: Chebyshev and Fourier Spectral Methods and a Degree-Increasing Spectral Homotopy [DISH],"Nonlinear differential and integral equations often have multiple solution branches. Reliable sofware to find all roots of a system of polynomial equations, as generated by standard discretizations for differential equations with polynomial nonlinearity, are now widely available. It is now feasible to pursue a global, all-branches attack on differential and integral equations. Unfortunately, both the number of solutions and computational cost grow exponentially fast with N, the number of degrees of freedom. And what if the nonlinearity is not polynomial? And how to continue from small-N to large N? Here, we show that Chebyshev and Fourier Petrov–Galerkin methods are “N-minimizing”, but especially with exploitation of cryptoperiodicity, parity and other symmetries, basis recombination, and unconventional Gegenbauer polynomial Petrov–Galerkin weights. We also show that Chebyshev–Padé technology is efficient at “polynomializing” transcendental nonlinearity. If the small-N solution is sufficiently accurate, continuation to larger N is a simple matter of initializing Newton’s iteration for large N with the solution for small N (“modal persistence”). When this fails, we introduce Newton-DISH: a Degree-Increasing Spectral Homotopy which is slower but more resilient. The major limitation is that present-day all-branches polynomial system solvers are limited, due to both operation count and memory storage, to rather modest N, typically 4–20, which we dub \(N_{feasible}\). If the interesting branches can be resolved at least crudely by \(N_{feasible}\) degrees of freedom, then the solutions can be refined to high accuracy by DISH. However, solution branches that demand \(N > N_{feasible}\) for even a poor approximation lie outside the scope of the strategy described here. Our theme is not that the “all-roots” strategy is universally applicable, but rather that its domain of usefulness is greatly expanded by using spectral methods in lieu of low order finite differences and finite elements. We demonstrate the power of the polynomial-solver and Chebyshev partnership by finding a hitherto unsuspected second branch (smooth and real-valued) of the Sag-Haselgrove nonlinear integral equation, which has been studied for more than half a century.",John P.

0,Higher Order Uniformly Convergent Numerical Algorithm for Time-Dependent Singularly Perturbed Differential-Difference Equations,"This paper presents a higher order uniformly convergent discretization for second order singularly perturbed parabolic differential equation with delay and advance terms. The retarded terms are approximated by the Taylor series which give rise to a nearby singularly perturbed parabolic differential equation. A hybrid numerical algorithm based on implicit Euler scheme is proposed to discretize the time variable and a combined finite difference scheme made out of modified upwind and central difference schemes to discretize the spatial variable on a piecewise uniform mesh of Shishkin type in space and a uniform mesh in time. The existence and uniqueness of a solution for the proposed hybrid algorithm is analyzed. It is proved that the algorithm is \(\epsilon \)-uniformly convergent of almost second order in space, \(O(N^{-2} (\ln N)^2)\) and first order in time, \(O(M^{-1})\). A few numerical experiments supporting the results are presented. The efficiency of the proposed hybrid algorithm is demonstrated by comparing upwind and modified upwind algorithm.","V. P. Ramesh

We study the long-time dynamics of a large class of dissipative systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations with time-decaying forcing functions. The nonlinear term can be, but not restricted to, any smooth vector field which, together with its first derivative, vanishes at the origin. The forcing function can be approximated, as time tends to infinity, by a series of functions which are coherent combinations of exponential, power and iterated logarithmic functions. We prove that any decaying solution admits an asymptotic expansion, as time tends to infinity, corresponding to the asymptotic structure of the forcing function. Moreover, these expansions can be generated by more than two base functions and go beyond the polynomial formulation imposed in previous work.","Dat Cao1 & Luan Hoang

0,"Slow Modulations of Periodic Waves in Hamiltonian PDEs, with Application to Capillary Fluids","Since its elaboration by Whitham almost 50 years ago, modulation theory has been known to be closely related to the stability of periodic traveling waves. However, it is only recently that this relationship has been elucidated and that fully nonlinear results have been obtained. These only concern dissipative systems though: reaction–diffusion systems were first considered by Doelman et al. (Mem Am Math Soc 199(934):viii+105, 2009), and viscous systems of conservation laws have been addressed by Johnson et al. (Invent Math, 2013). Here, only nondissipative models are considered, and a most basic question is investigated, namely, the expected link between the hyperbolicity of modulated equations and the spectral stability of periodic traveling waves to sideband perturbations. This is done first in an abstract Hamiltonian framework, which encompasses a number of dispersive models, in particular the well-known (generalized) Korteweg–de Vries equation and the less known Euler–Korteweg system, in both Eulerian coordinates and Lagrangian coordinates. The latter is itself an abstract framework for several models arising in water wave theory, superfluidity, and quantum hydrodynamics. As regards its application to compressible capillary fluids, attention is paid here to untangle the interplay between traveling waves/modulation equations in Eulerian coordinates and those in Lagrangian coordinates. In the most general setting, it is proved that the hyperbolicity of modulated equations is indeed necessary for the spectral stability of periodic traveling waves. This extends earlier results by Serre (Commun Partial Differ Equ 30(1–3):259–282, 2005), Oh and Zumbrun (Arch Ration Mech Anal 166(2):99–166, 2003), and Johnson et al. (Phys D 239(23–24):2057–2065, 2010). In addition, reduced necessary conditions are obtained in the small-amplitude limit. Then numerical investigations are carried out for the modulated equations of the Euler–Korteweg system with two types of “pressure” laws, namely, the quadratic law of shallow-water equations and the nonmonotone van der Waals pressure law. Both the evolutionarity and the hyperbolicity of the modulated equations are tested, and regions of modulational instability are thus exhibited.","S. Benzoni-Gavage1, P. Noble1 & L. M.

Inspired by the operators arising in quantum mechanics, in this paper, we investigate the continuity of a class of infinite-order differential operators acting on spaces of entire hyperholomorphic functions. We will consider two classes of hyperholomorphic functions, both being natural extensions of holomorphic functions of one complex variable. We show that, even though these two notions of hyperholomorphic functions are quite different from each other, in both cases, entire hyperholomorphic functions with exponential bounds play a crucial role in the continuity of infinite-order differential operators acting on these two classes of functions. This is particularly remarkable since the exponential function is not in the kernel of the Dirac operator, but it plays an important role in the theory of entire monogenic functions with growth conditions.","D.

0,A stochastic Stackelberg differential reinsurance and investment game with delay in a defaultable market,"In this paper, we investigate a stochastic Stackelberg differential reinsurance and investment game problem with delay for a reinsurer and an insurer in a defaultable market, which consists of a risk-free asset, a risky asset and a defaultable bond. As the leader, the reinsurer can determine reinsurance premium price and investment strategy to maximize the expected exponential utility of its terminal wealth with delay. As the follower, the insurer can select reinsurance proportion and investment strategy to maximize the expected exponential utility of its terminal wealth with delay. By using the idea of backward induction and the dynamic programming approach, we solve the leader’s and follower’s optimization problems sequentially and derive the Stackelberg equilibrium strategy explicitly. Then, we provide the corresponding verification theorem. Finally, we present some numerical examples to illustrate the influence of model parameters on the equilibrium strategy and draw some economic interpretations from these results. We find that the pre-default value functions are higher than the post-default value functions and the influence of delay weight on equilibrium strategy depends on the length of delay time. Moreover, when the Stackelberg equilibrium is achieved in the interior case, the optimal reinsurance premium follows the variance premium principle and the influence of delay weight on the optimal reinsurance premium strategy is just opposite to that on other strategies.","Yanfei Bai1, Zhongbao Zhou

0,On the spectral problem associated with the time-periodic nonlinear Schrödinger equation,"According to its Lax pair formulation, the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation can be expressed as the compatibility condition of two linear ordinary differential equations with an analytic dependence on a complex parameter. The first of these equations—often referred to as the x-part of the Lax pair—can be rewritten as an eigenvalue problem for a Zakharov–Shabat operator. The spectral analysis of this operator is crucial for the solution of the initial value problem for the NLS equation via inverse scattering techniques. For space-periodic solutions, this leads to the existence of a Birkhoff normal form, which beautifully exhibits the structure of NLS as an infinite-dimensional completely integrable system. In this paper, we take the crucial steps towards developing an analogous picture for time-periodic solutions by performing a spectral analysis of the t-part of the Lax pair with a periodic potential.","Jonatan Lenells1 & Ronald Quirchmayr

0,Filtering Theory for a Weakly Coloured Noise Process,"The problem of analyzing the Itô stochastic differential system and its filtering has received attention. The classical approach to accomplish filtering for the Itô SDE is the Kushner equation. In contrast to the classical filtering approach, this paper presents filtering for the stochastic differential system affected by weakly coloured noise, i.e., \(\dot{x}_{t} = f\left( {x_{t} } \right) + g\left( {x_{t} } \right)\xi_{t} ,\) where the input process \(\xi_{t}\) is a weakly coloured noise process. As a special case, the process \(\xi_{t}\) can be regarded as the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process, i.e., \(d\xi_{t} = - \alpha \xi_{t} dt + \beta dB_{t} ,\) where \(\alpha > 0.\) More precisely, the filtering model of this paper can be cast as
\(\dot{x}_{t} = f\left( {x_{t} } \right) + g\left( {x_{t} } \right)\xi_{t} ,\)

\(z_{t} = \int\limits_{{t_{0} }}^{t} {h(x_{\tau } )d\tau + \eta_{t} ,}\)
where \(h(x_{t} )\) is the measurement non-linearity and \(\eta = \{ \eta_{t} ,t_{0} \le t < \infty \}\) is the Brownian motion process. The former expression describes the structure of a noisy dynamical system, and the latter is the observation equation. The novelties of this paper are two (1) the extension of the filtering theory for the Itô stochastic differential system to the filtering theory for the ‘weakly coloured noise-driven’ stochastic differential system (2) the theory of this paper is based on a pioneering contribution of Ruslan Stratonovich involving the perturbation-theoretic approach to noisy dynamical systems in combination with the notion of the ‘filtering density’ evolution. The stochastic evolution of condition moment is derived by utilizing the filtering density evolution equation. A scalar Duffing system driven by the OU process is employed to test the effectiveness of the filtering theory of the paper. Numerical simulations involving four different sets of initial conditions and system parameters are utilized to examine the efficacy of the filtering algorithm of this paper.","Shaival H. Nagarsheth

Our main result establish that the free boundary is \(C^{1,\gamma }\) and \(u\in C^{1,s}\) near all regular points. Namely, we prove the following dichotomy at all free boundary points \(x_0\in \partial \{u=\varphi \}\):

(i)
either    \(u(x)-\varphi (x)=c\,d^{1+s}(x)+o(|x-x_0|^{1+s+\alpha })\)    for some \(c>0\),

These results were only known for the fractional Laplacian [2], and are completely new for more general integro-differential operators.

It is shown how conservation laws, pseudo-potentials, and linear problems arise naturally from geometric considerations, and it is also explained how Darboux and Bäcklund transformations can be constructed starting from geometric data. Classification results for equations in this class are stated, and hierarchies of equations of pseudo-spherical type are introduced, providing a connection between differential geometry and the study of hierarchies of equations which are the integrability condition of sl(2, R)-valued linear problems. Furthermore, the existence of correspondences between any two solutions to equations of pseudo-spherical type is reviewed, and a correspondence theorem for hierarchies is also mentioned. As applications, an elementary immersion result for pseudo-spherical metrics arising from the Chern–Tenenblat construction is proven, and non-local symmetries of the Kaup–Kupershmidt, Sawada–Kotera, fifth order Korteweg–de Vries and Camassa–Holm (CH) equation with non-zero critical wave speed are considered. It is shown that the existence of a non-local symmetry of a particular type is enough to single the first three equations out from a whole family of equations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces while, in the CH case, it is shown that it admits an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of non-local symmetries which includes the Virasoro algebra.",Enrique G.

The FBDSDEs with jumps are fully-coupled, the forward and backward equations work in different Euclidean spaces in general, the backward equation is Markovian, and the control problems are considered under full information or partial information in terms of σ-algebras that provide such information.

0,On the fredholmness of the Dirichlet problem for a second-order elliptic equation in grand-Sobolev spaces,"In this paper a second order elliptic equation with nonsmooth coefficients is considered in grand-Sobolev classes \(W_{q)}^{2} \left( \varOmega \right) \) on a bounded n-dimensional domain \(\varOmega \subset R^{n} \) with a sufficiently smooth boundary \(\partial \varOmega \), generated by the norm of the grand-Lebesgue space \(L_{q)}\left( \varOmega \right) \). These spaces are non-separable and therefore the definition of a reasonable solution in them faces certain difficulties. For this purpose, a subspace \(N_{q)}^{2} \left( \varOmega \right) \) is distinguished in which infinitely differentiable and finite functions are dense. The strict inclusion \(W_{q}^{2} \left( \varOmega \right) \subset N_{q)}^{2} \left( \varOmega \right) \) holds, where \(W_{q}^{2} \left( \varOmega \right) \) is the classical Sobolev space. This raises specific questions dictated by the theory of spaces \(W_{q}^{2} \left( \varOmega \right) \), for example, the characterization of the space of traces of functions from \(N_{q)}^{1} \left( \varOmega \right) \) cannot be characterized following the classical case. In this paper, the corresponding theorems concerning traces, extensions, and compactness of a family of functions from \(N_{q)}^{k} \left( \varOmega \right) \) are proved. These results are applied to obtain a Schauder-type estimate up to the boundary. Schauder-type estimates make it possible to establish the fredholmness of the Dirichlet problem for the considered equation in spaces \(N_{q)}^{2} \left( \varOmega \right) \) with data from grand-Lebesgue type spaces that are different from Lebesgue spaces. Therefore, the results of this work cannot be directly obtained from the results of the \(L_{p}\)-theory.

To facilitate the construction of the solution to this problem and to justify the choice of the form of the solution, equivalent integro-differential equations with symmetric and time-dependent kernels and time-varying integration limits are constructed. The advantages of the method of integro-differential equations are revealed in the transition to more complex dynamic systems carrying concentrated masses vibrating under the action of moving loads. The method is extended to a wider class of model boundary value problems that take into account bending stiffness, the resistance of the external environment, and the stiffness of the base of a vibrating object. The solution is given in dimensionless variables and is accurate up to second-order values with respect to small parameters characterizing the velocity of the boundary.

In the derivation, it is essential for the Lewis Number – i.e. the ratio between thermal and molecular diffusion – to be strictly less than unity. If ε is the inverse of the – reduced – activation energy, the idea underlying the construction of [17] is that (i) the time scale of the radius motion is ε-2, and that (ii) at each time step, the solution is ε-close to a steady solution.In this paper, we give a rigorous proof of the validity of this model under the restriction that the Lewis number is close to 1 – independently of the order of magnitude of the activation energy. The method used comprises three steps: (i) a linear stability analysis near a steady – or quasi-steady – solution, which justifies the fact that the relevant time scale is ε-2; (ii) the rigorous construction of an approximate solution; (iii) a nonlinear stability argument.

0,An efficient hybrid method to solve nonlinear differential equations in applied sciences,"In this study, by combining the generalized pseudospectral method, which is a new numerical method, with the quasi-linearization method (QLM), an efficient hybrid method to solve nonlinear differential equations in applied sciences and engineering is presented. Given that this method requires generalized Lagrange functions and their derivative operational matrices, we first introduce them and then implement the generalized pseudospectral method at each iteration of the quasi-linearization method and obtain a system of linear algebraic equations. In the presented method, derivative operational matrices are used, and also, the nonlinear differential equation is converted into a sequence of linear differential equations using QLM, so there is no need to calculate the analytical derivative and solve nonlinear systems during the implementation of the method, which reduces computational costs and increasing the efficiency of the method. The efficiency and accuracy of the method have been demonstrated by applying it to several important applied equations; the Blasius equation, the Falkner–Skan problem over an isothermal moving wedge, and the third-grade fluid in a porous half-space.

0,Optimal portfolio selection with consumption and nonlinear integro-differential equations with gradient constraint: A viscosity solution approach," We study a problem of optimal consumption and portfolio selection in a market where the logreturns of the uncertain assets are not necessarily normally distributed. The natural models then involve pure-jump Lévy processes as driving noise instead of Brownian motion like in the Black and Scholes model. The state constrained optimization problem involves the notion of local substitution and is of singular type. The associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is a nonlinear first order integro-differential equation subject to gradient and state constraints. We characterize the value function of the singular stochastic control problem as the unique constrained viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. This characterization is obtained in two main steps. First, we prove that the value function is a constrained viscosity solution of an integro-differential variational inequality. Second, to ensure that the characterization of the value function is unique, we prove a new comparison (uniqueness) result for the state constraint problem for a class of integro-differential variational inequalities. In the case of HARA utility, it is possible to determine an explicit solution of our portfolio-consumption problem when the Lévy process posseses only negative jumps.

0,MARS Approach for Global Sensitivity Analysis of Differential Equation Models with Applications to Dynamics of Influenza Infection,"Differential equation models are widely used for the study of natural phenomena in many fields. The study usually involves unknown factors such as initial conditions and/or parameters. It is important to investigate the impact of unknown factors (parameters and initial conditions) on model outputs in order to better understand the system the model represents. Apportioning the uncertainty (variation) of output variables of a model according to the input factors is referred to as sensitivity analysis. In this paper, we focus on the global sensitivity analysis of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models over a time period using the multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) as a meta model based on the concept of the variance of conditional expectation (VCE). We suggest to evaluate the VCE analytically using the MARS model structure of univariate tensor-product functions which is more computationally efficient.

Using the theory of parabolic pairs recently introduced in [22], we first formulate the parallelicity condition of \(\varepsilon \) on M as a system of partial differential equations, the parallel spinor flow equations, for a family of polyforms on an appropriate Cauchy surface \(\Sigma \hookrightarrow M\). The existence of a parallel spinor on (M, g) induces a system of constraint partial differential equations on \(\Sigma \), which we prove to be equivalent to an exterior differential system involving a cohomological condition on the shape operator of the embedding \(\Sigma \hookrightarrow M\). Solutions of this differential system are precisely the allowed initial data for the evolution problem of a parallel spinor and define the notion of parallel Cauchy pair \(({\mathfrak {e}},\Theta )\), where \({\mathfrak {e}}\) is a coframe and \(\Theta \) is a symmetric two-tensor. We characterize all parallel Cauchy pairs on simply connected Cauchy surfaces, refining a result of Leistner and Lischewski. Furthermore, we classify all compact three-manifolds admitting parallel Cauchy pairs, proving that they are canonically equipped with a locally free action of \({\mathbb {R}}^2\) and are isomorphic to certain torus bundles over \(S^1\), whose Riemannian structure we characterize in detail. Moreover, we classify all left-invariant parallel Cauchy pairs on simply connected Lie groups, specifying when they are allowed initial data for the Ricci flat equations and when the shape operator is Codazzi.

Resolving base points in the equivalent system of equations we can explain the complicated structure of singularities of the original equation. The Smith example has a solution with non-isolated singularity, which is an accumulation point of algebraic singularities. Smith’s equation can be written as a system in two ways. We show that the sequence of blow-ups for both systems can be infinite. Another example that we consider is the Painlevé-Ince equation. When the usual Painlevé analysis is applied, it possesses both positive and negative resonances. We show that for three equivalent systems there is an infinite sequence of blow-ups and another one that terminates, which further gives a Laurent expansion of the solution around a movable pole. Moreover, for one system it is even possible to obtain the general solution after a sequence of blow-ups.","Galina Filipuk

0,A Regular Integral Equation Formalism for Solving the Standard Boussinesq’s Equations for Variable Water Depth,"This paper begins with a question of existence of a regular integral equation formalism, but different from the existing usual ones, for solving the standard Boussinesq’s equations for variable water depth (or Peregrine’s model). For the question, a pseudo-water depth parameter, suggested by Jang (Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul 43:118–138, 2017), is introduced to alter the standard Boussinesq’s equations into an integral formalism. This enables us to construct a regular (nonlinear) integral equations of second kind (as required), being equivalent to the standard Boussinesq’s equations (of Peregrine’s model). The (constructed) integral equations are, of course, inherently different from the usual integral equation formalisms. For solving them, the successive approximation (or the fixed point iteration) is applied (Jang 2017), whereby a new iterative formula is immediately derived, in this paper, for numerical solutions of the standard Boussinesq’s equations for variable water depth. The formula, semi-analytic and derivative-free, is shown to be useful to observe especially the nonlinear wave phenomena of shallow water waves on a beach. In fact, a numerical experiment is performed on a solitary wave approaching a sloping beach. It shows clearly the main feature of nonlinear wave characteristics, which has reached good agreement with the known (numerical) solutions. Hence, while being theoretical but fundamental in nonlinear computational partial differential equations, the question raised in the study may be solved.",T. S.

0,A semi-analytic accuracy benchmark for Stokes flow in 3-D spherical mantle convection codes,One of the main challenges in numerical mantle circulation simulations is the determination of accurate solutions to the Stokes equation in combination with an additional constraint arising from the continuity equation. Here we derive a semi-analytic solution to the Stokes equation in a spherical shell using scalar and vector spherical harmonics. For the simple case of an incompressible flow with uniform viscosity we show that a direct relation exists between the flow velocity and the driving force through a fourth-order ordinary differential equation. The latter can be exploited to derive the forcing term from a prescribed velocity field. This feature lends itself to the design of a self-contained benchmark set-up that can be performed without relying on the numerical output from other codes. We demonstrate the applicability of the benchmark by verifying the convergence behaviour of the Stokes solver in the prototype of a new mantle convection modelling framework for high performance computing based on Hierarchical Hybrid Grids (HHG).,"André Horbach

0,On Forward–Backward Stochastic Differential Equations in a Domination-Monotonicity Framework,"In this paper, inspired by various stochastic linear-quadratic (LQ, for short) problems, we develop the method of continuation to study nonlinear forward–backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs, for short) in a kind of domination-monotonicity frameworks. The coupling of FBSDEs is in a general form, i.e., it not only appears in integral terms and terminal terms, but also in initial terms. By virtue of introducing various matrices, matrix-valued random variables and matrix-valued stochastic processes, we present the domination-monotonicity framework carefully and rigorously. A unique solvability result and a pair of estimates for coupled FBSDEs are obtained (see Theorem 3.5 in the case of simple domination-monotonicity conditions and Theorem 5.2 in the case of multi-level self-similar domination-monotonicity structures). As applications of theoretical results, the related stochastic Hamiltonian systems of several LQ problems are discussed.","Zhiyong Yu

0,Periodic Solutions of a Singularly Perturbed Delay Differential Equation with Two State-Dependent Delays,"Periodic orbits and associated bifurcations of singularly perturbed state-dependent delay differential equations (DDEs) are studied when the profiles of the periodic orbits contain jump discontinuities in the singular limit. A definition of singular solution is introduced which is based on a continuous parametrisation of the possibly discontinuous limiting solution. This reduces the construction of the limiting profiles to an algebraic problem. A model two state-dependent DDE is studied in detail and periodic singular solutions are constructed with one and two local maxima per period. A complete characterisation of the conditions on the parameters for these singular solutions to exist facilitates an investigation of bifurcation structures in the singular case revealing folds and possible cusp bifurcations. Sophisticated boundary value techniques are used to numerically compute the bifurcation diagram of the state-dependent DDE when the perturbation parameter is close to zero. This confirms that the solutions and bifurcations constructed in the singular case persist when the perturbation parameter is nonzero, and hence demonstrates that the solutions constructed using our singular solution definition are useful and relevant to the singularly perturbed problem. Fold and cusp bifurcations are found very close to the parameter values predicted by the singular solution theory, and we also find period-doubling bifurcations as well as periodic orbits with more than two local maxima per period, and explain the alignment between the folds on different bifurcation branches.","A.

0,Asymptotics of Regular Solutions to the Camassa–Holm Problem,"AbstractA periodic boundary value problem is considered for a modified Camassa–Holm equation, which differs from the well-known classical equation by several additional quadratic terms. Three important conditions on the coefficients of the equation are formulated under which the original equation has the Camassa–Holm type. The dynamic properties of regular solutions in neighborhoods of all equilibrium states are investigated. Special nonlinear boundary value problems are constructed to determine the “leading” components of solutions. Asymptotic formulas for the set of periodic solutions and finite-dimensional tori are obtained. The problem of infinite-dimensional tori is studied. It is shown that the normalized equation in this problem can be compactly written in the form of a partial differential equation only for the classical Camassa–Holm equation. An asymptotic analysis is presented in the cases when one of the coefficients in the linear part of the equation is sufficiently small, while the period in the boundary conditions is sufficiently large.","S.

0,Linear gradient structures and discrete gradient methods for conservative/dissipative differential-algebraic equations,"In this paper, the use of discrete gradients is considered for differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) with a conservation/dissipation law. As one of the most popular numerical methods for conservative/dissipative ordinary differential equations, the framework of the discrete gradient method has been intensively developed over recent decades. Although discrete gradients have been applied to several specific DAEs, no unified framework has yet been constructed. In this paper, the author moves toward the establishment of such a framework, and introduces concepts including an appropriate linear gradient structure for DAEs. Then, it is revealed that the simple use of discrete gradients does not imply the discrete conservation/dissipation laws. Fortunately, however, for the case of index-1 DAEs, an appropriate reformulation and a new discrete gradient enable us to successfully construct a novel scheme, which satisfies both of the discrete conservation/dissipation law and the constraint. This first attempt may provide an indispensable basis for constructing a unified framework of discrete gradient methods for DAEs.","Shun Sato

In this regard, we first establish the well-posedness of the underlying problem by investigations concerning the existence, uniqueness, and influence of perturbed data on the behavior of the solutions as well as smoothness of the solutions under some assumptions on the given data. Next, from the numerical perspective, we develop and analyze a well-conditioned and high-order numerical approach based on an operational spectral Galerkin method. The main advantage of our strategy is that it characterizes the approximate solution via some recurrence formulas, instead of solving a complex non-linear block algebraic system that requires high computational costs. Moreover, the familiar spectral accuracy is justified in a weighted \(L^2\)-norm, and some practical test problems are provided to approve efficiency of the proposed method.","A. Faghih1 & P.

Based on suitable energy dissipation inequalities quantified in terms of two small parameters, thickness of the fluid layer and thickness of the elastic structure, we identify the right relation between the system coefficients and small parameters which eventually provide a reduced model on the vanishing limit. The reduced model is a linear sixth-order thin-film equation describing the out-of-plane displacement of the structure, which is justified in terms of weak convergence results relating its solution to the solutions of the original fluid–structure interaction problem.

In order to address this, the argumentation requires the use of Strichartz estimates and some microlocal analysis results such as propagation of microlocal defect measures and the Gárard’s linearizability property.

The equation \((1)\) is said to have a center on \([a,b]\) if all its solutions (with the initial value \(y(a)\) small enough) are closed. The problems of counting closed solutions (Smale–Pugh problem) is strongly related to the classical Hilbert 16th problem of bounding the number of limit cycles of a plane polynomial vector field. In turn, the problem of giving conditions on \((p,q,a,b)\) for \((1)\) to have a center on \([a,b]\) is analogous to the classical Poincaré center–focus problem for plane vector fields. It is well known that both in the classical and in the Abel equation cases the center conditions are given by an infinite system of polynomial equations in the parameter space. The complexity of this system presents one of the main difficulties in the center–focus problem, as well as in the bounding of closed trajectories. In recent years two important structures have been related to the center equations for \((1)\): composition algebra and moment vanishing. In the present paper we give an overview of these results (sometimes providing also new ones), stressing their algebraic–geometric interpretation and consequences. The second part of the paper is devoted to a rather detailed study of a specific example of the Abel equation which possesses algebraic solutions.

Such differential systems of separable variables are important due to the fact that after a blow-up change of variables any planar quasi-homogeneous polynomial differential system can be transformed into a special differential system of separable variables \(\dot{x}=xf\left (y\right )\), \(\dot{y}=g\left (y\right )\), with \(f\) and \(g\) polynomials.","Jaume Llibre1 & Yuzhou Tian

0,"Conformal geometry of marginally trapped surfaces in \(\mathbb {S}^4_1\)
","A spacelike surface S immersed in \(\mathbb {S}^4_1\) is marginally trapped if its mean curvature vector is everywhere lightlike. On any oriented spacelike surface S immersed in \(\mathbb {S}^4_1\) we show that a choice of orientation of the normal bundle \(\nu (S)\) determines a smooth map \(G: S \rightarrow \mathbb {S}^3\) which we call the null Gauss map of S. If S is marginally trapped we show that G is a conformal immersion away from the zeros of certain quadratic Hopf-differential of S and so the surface G(S) is uniquely determined up to conformal transformations of \(\mathbb {S}^3\) by two invariants: the normal Hopf differential \(\kappa \) and the schwartzian derivative s. These invariants plus an additional quadratic differential \(\delta \) are related by a differential equation and determine the geometry of S up to ambient isometries of \(\mathbb {S}^4_1\). This allows us to obtain a characterization of marginally trapped surfaces S whose null Gauss image is a constrained Willmore surface in \(\mathbb {S}^3\) in the sense of Bohle et al.

The idea of LDG methods is to suitably rewrite a higher-order partial differential equations into a first-order system, then apply the discontinuous Galerkin method to the system. A key ingredient for the success of such methods is the correct design of interface numerical fluxes. The energy stability for general solutions of the method is proved. Comparing with the Camassa–Holm equation in one-dimensional case, there are more auxiliary variables which are introduced to handle high-order derivative terms. The proof of the stability is more complicated. The resulting scheme is high-order accuracy and flexible for arbitrary h and p adaptivity.

After splitting the Caputo fractional derivative of order \(\alpha \) \((1<\alpha \le 2)\) into a weakly singular integral and a classical second derivative, the classical Gauss–Jacobi quadrature is used to solve the weakly singular integral and a new spatial WENO-type reconstruction methodology is proposed to approximate the second derivative. There are two advantages of the new WENO scheme: the first is that the linear weights can be any positive numbers on condition that their summation equals one, and the second is its simplicity in the engineering applications. The new WENO reconstruction is a convex combination of a quartic polynomial with two linear polynomials defined on three unequal-sized spatial stencils in a traditional WENO fashion. This new sixth-order WENO scheme uses smaller number of cell average information than that of the same order classical WENO schemes and could eliminate non-physical oscillations near strong discontinuities when solving the fractional differential equations.

0,"Hyperviscous shock layers and diffusion zones: Monotonicity, spectral viscosity, and pseudospectral methods for very high order differential equations","We solve two problems ofx∈[−∞, ∞] for arbitrary orderj. The first is to compute shock-like solutions to the hyperdiffusion equation,u1=(−1)j+1

u
2j.x+uu
x=0; these tanh-like solutions are asymptotic approximations to the shocks of the corresponding time dependent equation. We solve the hyperdiffusion equation with a Fourier integral and the method of steepest descents. The hyper Burgers equation is solved by a Fourier pseudospectral method with a polynomial subtraction.Except for the special case of ordinary diffusion (j=1), the jump across the shock zone is described bynonmonotonic, oscillatory functions. By smearing the front over the width of a grid spacing, it is possible to numerically resolve the shock with a weaker and weaker viscosity coefficient asj, the order of the damping, increases. This makes such “hyperviscous” dampings very attractive for coping with fronts since, outside the frontal zone, the impact of the artificial hyperviscosity is much smaller than with ordinary viscosity. Unfortunately, both the intensity of the oscillations and the slowness of their exponential decay from the center of the shock zone decrease asj increases so that the shock zone is muchwider than for ordinary diffusion. We also examined generalizations of Burgers equation with “spectral viscosity”, that is, damping which is tailored to yield exponentially small errors outside the frontal zone when combined with spectral methods. We find behavior similar to high order hyperviscosity.We conclude that high order damping, as a tool for shock-capturing, offers both advantages and drawbacks. Monotonicity, which has been the holy grail of so much recent algorithm development, is a reasonable goal only for ordinary viscosity. Hyperviscous fronts and shock zones in flows with “spectral viscosity” aresupposed to oscillate.",John P.

In 2007, a cooperative differential game model of transboundary industrial pollution was presented by Yeung. It is the first time that time-consistent solutions are derived in a cooperative differential game on pollution control with industries and governments being separate entities. In this paper, we extend Yeung’s model to an even more general model, in which emission permits trading is taken into account. Our objective is to make use of optimal control theory to find the two regions’ noncooperative and cooperative optimal emission paths such that the regions’ discounted stream of net revenues is maximized. We illustrate the results with a numerical example.",Shoude Li,Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-013-0384-7,"Differential game,Emission permits trading,HJB equation"

0,Numerical and analytical solution to a conformable fractional Fornberg–Whitham equation,"In this work, we perform a broader analytical and numerical study of a space-time conformable fractional Fornberg–Whitham equation. The concept of conformable fractional Laplace transform was infused in the well-known homotopy analysis method (HAM), to obtain a more accurate solution. We named this method q-Homotopy Analysis Conformable Fractional Laplace Transform Method (q-HACFLTM). In addition, thorough numerical analysis using graphs and error analysis confirms that q-HACFLTM performs better and more accurately than the q-HAM technique previously applied to solve this problem. Moreover, the proposed method eliminates any form of restriction on the fractional order of the derivatives as was the case in the previous work of Iyiola and Ojo (Pramana J Phys 58(4): 567–575, 2005). Our method (q-HACFLTM) is quite easy and highly accurate and could be adopted for use in solving other fractional differential equation models, once similar properties of Laplace transform used here could be established. The q-HACFLTM technique applied here does not require any perturbation, discretization, polynomials or Lagrange multiplier, thus giving it some advantage over methods like ADM, HPTM or VIM, etc. The Laplace transform introduced was able to handle the nonlinear terms of the equation in a more robust manner, resulting in more accurate solution and faster convergence.","Cyril D.

0,Efficient numerical approximation of a non-regular Fokker–Planck equation associated with first-passage time distributions,"In neuroscience, the distribution of a decision time is modelled by means of a one-dimensional Fokker–Planck equation with time-dependent boundaries and space-time-dependent drift. Efficient approximation of the solution to this equation is required, e.g., for model evaluation and parameter fitting. However, the prescribed boundary conditions lead to a strong singularity and thus to slow convergence of numerical approximations. In this article we demonstrate that the solution can be related to the solution of a parabolic PDE on a rectangular space-time domain with homogeneous initial and boundary conditions by transformation and subtraction of a known function. We verify that the solution of the new PDE is indeed more regular than the solution of the original PDE and proceed to discretize the new PDE using a space-time minimal residual method. We also demonstrate that the solution depends analytically on the parameters determining the boundaries as well as the drift. This justifies the use of a sparse tensor product interpolation method to approximate the PDE solution for various parameter ranges. The predicted convergence rates of the minimal residual method and that of the interpolation method are supported by numerical simulations.","Udo Boehm

0,Interlacing Properties of Coefficient Polynomials in Differential Operator Representations of Real-Root Preserving Linear Transformations,"We study linear transformations \(T :\mathbb {R}[x] \rightarrow \mathbb {R}[x]\) of the form \(T[x^n]=P_n(x)\) where \(\{P_n(x)\}\) is a real orthogonal polynomial system. With \(T=\sum \tfrac{Q_k(x)}{k!}D^k\), we seek to understand the behavior of the transformation T by studying the roots of the \(Q_k(x)\). We prove four main things. First, we show that the only case where the \(Q_k(x)\) are constant and \(\{P_n(x)\}\) is an orthogonal system is when the \(P_n(x)\) form a shifted set of generalized probabilist Hermite polynomials. Second, we show that the coefficient polynomials \(Q_k(x)\) have real roots when the \(P_n(x)\) are the physicist Hermite polynomials or the Laguerre polynomials. Next, we show that in these cases, the roots of successive polynomials strictly interlace, a property that has not yet been studied for coefficient polynomials. We conclude by discussing the Chebyshev and Legendre polynomials, proving a conjecture of Chasse, and presenting several open problems.","David A. Cardon1, Evan L. Sorensen2 & Jason C.

0,Bicompact Schemes for the Multidimensional Convection–Diffusion Equation,"AbstractBicompact schemes are generalized for the first time to the linear multidimensional convection–diffusion equation. Schemes are constructed using the method of lines, the finite-volume method, and bi- and tricubic Hermite interpolation of the sought function in a cell. Time stepping is based on diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta methods. The proposed bicompact schemes are unconditionally stable, conservative, and fourth-order accurate in space for sufficiently smooth solutions. The constructed schemes are implemented by applying an efficient iterative method based on approximate factorization of their multidimensional equations. Every iteration of the method is reduced to a set of independent one-dimensional scalar two-point Gaussian eliminations. Several stationary and nonstationary exact solutions are used to demonstrate the high-order convergence of the developed schemes and the fast convergence of their iterative implementation. Advantages of bicompact schemes as compared with Galerkin-type finite-element schemes are discussed.",M. D. Bragin1 & B. V.

This paper presents a study of the numerical solution of a non-linear foam drainage equation with time-fractional derivative. We use the two-scale approach which is formulated by combining the fractional complex transform and the homotopy perturbation method (HPM).  With the aid of the fractional complex transform, first, we transform the problem into its differential partner and then HPM is applied to obtain the He’s polynomials which are highly and powerful support for non-linear problems. Further, we put forward the theory of the two-scale approach which reveals the sketch between fractional complex transform and the solution of non-linear foam drainage equation. The significant results illustrate that this approach does not require any assumption while it reduces the heavy calculation without any restrictive variable. This approach also sheds a bright light on practical applications of fractal calculus.

We develop a unified intrinsic approach to establish the global weak rigidity of both the GCR equations and isometric immersions of the Riemannian manifolds, independent of the local coordinates, and provide further insights of the previous local results and arguments. The critical case has also been analyzed. To achieve this, we first reformulate the GCR equations with div-curl structure intrinsically on Riemannian manifolds and develop a global, intrinsic version of the div-curl lemma and other nonlinear techniques to tackle the global weak rigidity on manifolds. In particular, a general functional-analytic compensated compactness theorem on Banach spaces has been established, which includes the intrinsic div-curl lemma on Riemannian manifolds as a special case. The equivalence of global isometric immersions, the Cartan formalism, and the GCR equations on the Riemannian manifolds with lower regularity is established. We also prove a new weak rigidity result along the way, pertaining to the Cartan formalism, for Riemannian manifolds with lower regularity, and extend the weak rigidity results for Riemannian manifolds with corresponding different metrics.","Gui-Qiang G.

The method of separation of variables is used for investigation. An exponential solution is found in the case of an autonomous equation with linearly homogeneous right-hand side. It is shown that the equation has a solution in the form of a polylinear function in the case when the right-hand side of the equation contains the product of power functions of independent variables. Also, we have found solutions in the form of linear combination of exponents and in the form of generalized polynomials. The conditions on the parameters of the equation are given under which the above-mentioned solutions exist. Theorems determining the possibility of decreasing the dimension of the equation are proved. In particular, the initial equation is reduced to an ordinary differential equation for the solutions in the form of one- dimensional traveling waves, and it is reduced to a partial differential equation of lesser dimension for the solutions in the form of multi-dimensional traveling waves.

0,Stochastic Magnetic Hydrodynamic Hierarchy in a Strong External Magnetic Field,"AbstractBased on a stochastic microscopic collisional model of the motion of charged particles in a strong external magnetic field, a hierarchy of equations of magnetic hydrodynamics is constructed. The transition to increasingly rough approximations occurs in accordance with a decrease in the dimensioning parameter, similar to the Knudsen number in gas dynamics. The result is stochastic and nonrandom macroscopic equations that differ from the magnetic analog of the Navier–Stokes system of equations, as well as from the systems of magnetic quasi-hydrodynamics. The main feature of this derivation is more accurate velocity averaging due to the analytical solution of stochastic differential equations with respect to the Wiener measure, in the form of which the intermediate meso model is presented in the phase space. This approach differs significantly from the traditional one, which uses not the random process itself but its distribution function. Emphasis is placed on the clarity of assumptions when moving from one level of detail to another, and not on numerical experiments that contain additional approximation errors.",S. V. Bogomolov1 & N.

In this paper, we provide a unified and effective method of functional analysis for the study of a supermarket model with server multiple vacations. Firstly, we analyze a supermarket model of N identical servers with server multiple vacations, and set up an infinite-dimensional system of differential (or mean-field) equations, which is satisfied by the expected fraction vector, in terms of a technique of tailed equations. Secondly, as N→ ∞ we use the operator semigroup to provide a mean-field limit for the sequence of Markov processes, which asymptotically approaches a single trajectory identified by the unique and global solution to the infinite-dimensional system of limiting differential equations. Thirdly, we provide an effective algorithm for computing the fixed point of the infinite-dimensional system of limiting differential equations, and use the fixed point to give performance analysis of this supermarket model, including the mean of stationary queue length in any server and the expected sojourn time that any arriving customer spends in this system. Finally, we use some numerical examples to analyze how the performance measures depend on some crucial factors of this supermarket model. Note that the method of this paper will be useful and effective for performance analysis of complicated supermarket models with respect to resource management in practical areas such as computer networks, manufacturing systems and transportation networks.","Quan-Lin Li1, Guirong Dai1, John C.

It is required to design an algorithm that forms a feedback control and guarantees a prescribed quality of the controlled process.
More exactly, the solution of this equation should track the solution of another equation, which is subject to an unknown perturbation.
Methods for solving problems of this type for systems described by ordinary differential equations are well known and are presented,
in particular, within the theory of positional control. In the present paper, we study a tracking problem in which the role of
the control object is played by an equation with distributed parameters. It is assumed that the solutions of the equations are measured with an error,
and the only available information about the perturbation is that it is an element of the space of functions summable with the square of the Euclidean norm;
i.e., the perturbation can be unbounded. Taking into account these features of the problem, we design solution algorithms that are stable
under information disturbances and computational errors. The algorithms are based on a combination of elements of
the theory of ill-posed problems with the extremal shift method known in the theory of positional differential games.

We began this study in James et al. (Arch Ration Mech Anal 231(2):787–843, 2019). Homoenergetic solutions satisfy an integro-differential equation which contains, in addition to the classical Boltzmann collision operator, a linear hyperbolic term. In James et al. (2019), it has been proved rigorously the existence of self-similar solutions which describe the change of the average energy of the particles of the system in the case in which there is a balance between the hyperbolic and the collision term. In this paper, we focus in homoenergetic solutions for which the collision term is much larger than the hyperbolic term (collision-dominated behavior). In this case, the long-time asymptotics for the distribution of velocities is given by a time-dependent Maxwellian distribution with changing temperature.","Richard D. James1, Alessia Nota

The key to the present investigation is that the MGT equation falls within a large class of systems with memory, with affine term depending on a parameter. For this model equation, a regularity theory is provided, which is also of independent interest; it is shown in particular that the effect of boundary data that are square integrable (in time and space) is the same displayed by the wave equation. Then, a general picture of the (interior) regularity of solutions corresponding to homogeneous boundary conditions is specifically derived for the MGT equation in various functional settings. This confirms the gain of one unity in space regularity for the time derivative of the unknown, a feature that sets the MGT equation apart from other partial differential equation models for wave propagation. The adopted perspective and method of proof enable us to attain as well boundary regularity results for both the integro-differential equation and the MGT equation.",Francesca Bucci1 & Luciano Pandolfi,Journal of Evolution Equations,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00028-019-00549-x,"Interior regularity,Boundary regularity,Moore–Gibson–Thompson equation,Wave equations with memory,Volterra integro-differential equations,Ultrasound propagation"

Contrary to naive differential degree counting, the distance functions are shown to gain one degree and hence to be \(C^{1,1}\). As an application to mathematical relativity, it is argued that the mentioned differentiability conditions can be considered the optimal ones to preserve most results of causality theory. This theory is also shown to be generalizable to the Finsler spacetime case. In particular, we prove that the local Lorentzian(-Finsler) length maximization property of causal geodesics in the class of absolutely continuous causal curves holds already for \(C^{1,1}\) spacetime metrics.

0,Generic differential operators on Siegel modular forms and special polynomials,"Holomorphic vector valued differential operators acting on Siegel modular forms and preserving automorphy under the restriction to diagonal blocks are important in many respects, including application to critical values of L functions. Such differential operators are associated with vectors of new special polynomials of several variables defined by certain harmonic conditions. They include the classical Gegenbauer polynomial as a prototype, and are interesting as themselves independently of Siegel modular forms. We will give formulas for all such polynomials in two different ways. One is to describe them using polynomials characterized by monomials in off-diagonal block variables. We will give an explicit and practical algorithm to give the vectors of polynomials through these. The other one is rather theoretical but seems much deeper. We construct an explicit generating series of polynomials mutually related under certain mixed Laplacians. Here substituting the variables of the polynomials to partial derivatives, we obtain the generic differential operator from which any other differential operators of this sort are obtained by certain projections. This process exhausts all the differential operators in question. This is also generic in the sense that for any number of variables and block partitions, it is given by a recursive unified expression. As an application, we prove that the Taylor coefficients of Siegel modular forms with respect to off-diagonal block variables, or of corresponding expansion of Jacobi forms, are essentially vector valued Siegel modular forms of lower degrees, which are obtained as images of the differential operators given above. We also show that the original forms are recovered by the images of our operators. This is an ultimate generalization of Eichler–Zagier’s results on Jacobi forms of degree one.

0,"Curve Fitting, Differential Equations And The Riemann Hypothesis","It is known that the Riemann zeta function ζ (s) in the critical strip 0 < Re(s) < 1, may be represented as the Mellin transform of a certain function φ (x) which is related to one of the theta functions. The function φ (x) satisfies a well known functional equation, and guided by this property we deduce a family of approximating functions involving an arbitrary parameter α. The approximating function corresponding to the value of α = 2 gives rise to a particularly accurate numerical approximation to the function φ (x). Another approximation to φ (x), which is based upon the first one, is obtained by solving a certain differential equation. Yet another approximating function may be determined as a simple extension of the first. All three approximations, when used in conjunction with the Mellin transform expression for ζ (s) in the critical strip, give rise to an explicit expression from which it is clear that Re(s) = 1/2 is a necessary and sufficient condition for the vanishing of the imaginary part of the integral, the real part of which is non-zero. Accordingly, the analogy with the Riemann hypothesis is only partial, but nevertheless Re(s) = 1/2 emerges from the analysis in a fairly explicit manner. While it is generally known that the imaginary part of the Mellin transform must vanish along Re(s) = 1/2, the major contribution of this paper is the presentation of the actual calculation for three functions which approximate φ (x). The explicit nature of these calculation details may facilitate progress towards the corresponding calculation for the actual φ (x), which may be necessary in a resolution of the Riemann hypothesis.",James M.

0,Exponential Stability of Traveling Pulse Solutions of a Singularly Perturbed System of Integral Differential Equations Arising From Excitatory Neuronal Networks,"We establish the exponential stability of fast traveling pulse solutions to nonlinear singularly perturbed systems of integral di.erential equations arising from neuronal networks. It has been proved that exponential stability of these orbits is equivalent to linear stability. Let \( {\user1{\mathcal{L}}} \) be the linear differential operator obtained by linearizing the nonlinear system about its fast pulse, and let \( \sigma {\left( {\user1{\mathcal{L}}} \right)} \) be the spectrum of \( {\user1{\mathcal{L}}} \). The linearized stability criterion says that if \( \max {\left\{ {\operatorname{Re} \lambda :\lambda \in \sigma {\left( {\user1{\mathcal{L}}} \right)},\lambda \ne 0} \right\}} \leqslant - D \), for some positive constant D, and λ = 0 is a simple eigenvalue of \( {\user1{\mathcal{L}}}{\left( \varepsilon \right)} \), then the stability follows immediately (see [13] and [37]). Therefore, to establish the exponential stability of the fast pulse, it suffices to investigate the spectrum of the operator \( {\user1{\mathcal{L}}} \). It is relatively easy to find the continuous spectrum, but it is very difficult to find the isolated spectrum. The real part of the continuous spectrum has a uniformly negative upper bound, hence it causes no threat to the stability. It remains to see if the isolated spectrum is safe.Eigenvalue functions (see [14] and [35,36]) have been a powerful tool to study the isolated spectrum of the associated linear differential operators because the zeros of the eigenvalue functions coincide with the eigenvalues of the operators. There have been some known methods to define eigenvalue functions for nonlinear systems of reaction diffusion equations and for nonlinear dispersive wave equations. But for integral differential equations, we have to use different ideas to construct eigenvalue functions. We will use the method of variation of parameters to construct the eigenvalue functions in the complex plane ℂ. By analyzing the eigenvalue functions, we find that there are no nonzero eigenvalues of \( {\user1{\mathcal{L}}}{\kern 1pt} {\text{in}}{\left\{ {\lambda \in \mathbb{C}:\operatorname{Re} \lambda \geqslant - D} \right\}} \)  for the fast traveling pulse. Moreover λ = 0 is simple. This implies that the exponential stability of the fast orbits is true.",Linghai Zhang,"Acta Mathematicae Applicatae Sinica, English Series",2004,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10255-004-0168-9,"Integral differential equations,traveling pulse solutions,exponential stability,linear differential operators,eigenvalue problems,eigenvalue functions"

Such equations are termed as conditionally oscillatory equations and are classified according to the result established by Einar Hille, wherein Euler-type differential equations are used as scale marks for classification. Moreover, nonoscillatory solutions can be converted into oscillatory solutions by introducing impulse. Thus, this research determines the least possible amount of impulse required to oscillate all nonoscillatory solutions for each classified group of conditionally oscillatory equations without altering the parameter. Presumably, nonoscillatory solutions can be expected to oscillate when a large amount of impulse is added.

0,Spectral Features of the Solving of a Fredholm Homogeneous Integro-Differential Equation with Integral Conditions and Reflecting Deviation,"The problems of solvability and construction of solutions of a nonlocal boundary value problem for the second-order Fredholm integro-differential equation with degenerate kernel, integral conditions, spectral parameters and reflecting deviation are considered. Using the method of the degenerate kernel, the boundary value problem is integrated as an ordinary differential equation. When we define the arbitrary integration constants there are possible five cases with respect to the first spectral parameter. Calculated values of the spectral parameter for each case. Further, the problem is reduced to solving systems of linear algebraic equations. Irregular values of the second spectral parameter are determined. At irregular values of the second spectral parameter the Fredholm determinant is degenerate. Other values of the second spectral parameter, for which the Fredholm determinant does not degenerate, are called regular values. Taking the values of the first spectral parameter into account for regular values of the second spectral parameter the corresponding solutions were constructed for each of five cases. The stability of the solution of the boundary value problem for given values in integral conditions is proved. The conditions under which the solution of the boundary value problem will be small are studied. For the irregular values of the second spectral parameter each of the five cases is checked separately. The orthogonality conditions are used. Cases are determined in which the problem has an infinite number of solutions and these solutions are constructed. For other cases, the absence of nontrivial solutions of the problem is proved.",T.

0,"Averaging of Differential Equations Generating Oscillations and an Application to Control 

","Abstract.  In this article we consider differential equations which generate oscillating solutions. These oscillations are due to the presence of a small parameter ɛ>0 ; however, they are not present in the coefficients but instead they are caused by a penalty term involving an antisymmetric operator. Our aims are twofold. In the first part we study asymptotics at all orders, for ɛ→ 0 , construct approximate solutions, and derive estimates of the error between the exact solution and the approximate ones. One of the motivations of this part is the study to high orders of the geostrophic asymptotics in atmospheric science, but there are many other possible applications involving in particular the wave equation. The actual applications of our results to atmospheric science will be discussed elsewhere [STW], as well as, on the mathematical side, the application to partial differential equations [TW1]. In the second part of this article we study a control problem involving such an equation and study the behavior of the state equation, of the optimal control, and of the optimality equation as ɛ→ 0 . For the control part we restrict ourselves to a linear equation and to the first order in the asymptotics ɛ→ 0 , leaving nonlinear problems and higher orders to a future work.

Methods, 24, 1988, pp. 1071–1083 (in Russian)] that the behavior of the trajectories of (*) is similar to the behavior of a solution for the famous Burgers equation; namely, any trajectory of (*) rapidly converging at the initial moment of time to zero asn → −8 and to 1 asn → ∞ converges with the time uniformly inn to a wave-train that moves with constant velocity. On the other hand, (*) is a variant of discretization for the shock-wave equation, and this variant differs from those previously examined by Lax and others.In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the Cauchy problem for the equation (*) with non-monotonic functionϕ of a special form, considering this investigation as a step toward elaboration of the general case. We show that under certain conditions, trajectories of (*) with time convergence to the sum of two wave-trains with different overfalls moving with different velocities. The velocity of the front wave is greater, so that the distance between wave-trains increases linearly.The investigation of (*) with non-monotonicϕ may have important consequences for studying the Schumpeterian evolution of industries (G.

0,Solving Black–Scholes equations using fractional generalized homotopy analysis method,"This paper aims to solve the Black–Scholes (B–S) model for the European options pricing problem using a hybrid method called fractional generalized homotopy analysis method (FGHAM). The convergence region of the B–S model solutions are clearly identified using h-curve and the closed form series solutions are produced using FGHAM. To verify the convergence of the proposed series solutions, sequence of errors are obtained by estimating the deviation between the exact solution and the series solution, which is increased in number of terms in the series. The convergence of sequence of errors is verified using the convergence criteria and the results are graphically illustrated. Moreover, the FGHAM approach has overcome the difficulties of applying multiple integration and differentiation procedures while obtaining the solution using well-established methods such as homotopy analysis method and homotopy perturbation method. The computational efficiency of the proposed method is analyzed using a comparative study. The advantage of the proposed method is shown with a numerical example using the comparative study between FGHAM and Monte Carlo simulation. Using the numerical example, analytical expression for the implied volatility is derived and the non-local behavior is studied for the various values of the fractional parameter. The results of FGHAM are statistically validated with the exact solution and the other existing computational methods.","S. R. Saratha1, G. Sai Sundara Krishnan2, M.

0,Bonnet and Isotropically Isothermic Surfaces in 4-Dimensional Space Forms,"We study the Bonnet problem for surfaces in 4-dimensional space forms, namely, to what extent a surface is determined by the metric and the mean curvature. Two isometric surfaces have the same mean curvature if there exists a parallel vector bundle isometry between their normal bundles that preserves the mean curvature vector fields. We deal with the structure of the moduli space of congruence classes of isometric surfaces with the same mean curvature and with properties inherited on a surface by this structure. The study of this problem led us to a new conformally invariant property, called isotropic isothermicity, that coincides with the usual concept of isothermicity for surfaces lying in totally umbilical hypersurfaces, and is related to lines of curvature and infinitesimal isometric deformations that preserve the mean curvature vector field. The class of isotropically isothermic surfaces includes the one of surfaces with a vertically harmonic Gauss lift and particularly the minimal surfaces, and overlaps with that of isothermic surfaces without containing the entire class. We show that if a simply connected surface is not proper Bonnet, which means that the moduli space is a finite set, then it admits either at most one, or exactly three Bonnet mates. For simply connected proper Bonnet surfaces, the moduli space is either 1-dimensional with at most two connected components diffeomorphic to the circle, or the 2-dimensional torus. We prove that simply connected Bonnet surfaces lying in totally geodesic hypersurfaces of the ambient space as surfaces of non-constant mean curvature always admit Bonnet mates that do not lie in any totally umbilical hypersurface. Such surfaces either admit exactly three Bonnet mates, or they are proper Bonnet with moduli space the torus. We show that isotropic isothermicity characterizes the proper Bonnet surfaces, and we provide relevant conditions for non-existence of Bonnet mates for compact surfaces. Moreover, we study compact surfaces that are locally proper Bonnet, and we prove that the existence of a uniform substructure on the local moduli spaces characterizes surfaces with a vertically harmonic Gauss lift that are neither minimal, nor superconformal. In particular, we show that the only compact, locally proper Bonnet surfaces with moduli space the torus, are those with nonvanishing parallel mean curvature vector field and positive genus.","Kleanthis Polymerakis

Then the authors prove that some common classes of low-order AODEs are noncritical. For rational solutions, the authors determine a class of AODEs, which are called maximally comparable, such that the possible poles of any rational solutions are recognizable from their coefficients. This generalizes the well-known fact that any pole of rational solutions to a linear ODE is contained in the set of zeros of its leading coefficient. Finally, the authors develop an algorithm to compute all rational solutions of certain maximally comparable AODEs, which is applicable to 78.54% of the AODEs in Kamke’s collection of standard differential equations.","Thieu N.

The selection of an appropriate value of δ in δ-HPTM and the auxiliary parameters n and ħ in q-HATM gives a guaranteed convergence of series solution, but the difference between the two techniques is that the embedding parameter p in δ-HPTM varies from zero to nonzero δ, whereas the embedding parameter q in q-HATM varies from zero to \(\frac{1}{n}, n\geq{1}\). We examine the effect of fractional order on the considered problem and present the error estimate when compared with exact solution. The outcomes reveal complete reliability and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for solving various types of physical models arising in sciences and engineering. Furthermore, we present the convergence and error analysis of the two methods.","Lanre Akinyemi

0,A Numerically Efficient Dissipation-Preserving Implicit Method for a Nonlinear Multidimensional Fractional Wave Equation,"This work is motivated by the investigation of a fractional extension of a general nonlinear multidimensional wave equation with damping. The model under study considers partial derivatives of orders in \((0, 1) \cup (1, 2]\) with respect to the spatial variables. The undamped one-dimensional version of the model was previously used in the literature to investigate the presence of the nonlinear phenomenon of supratransmission in fractional relativistic wave equations. In agreement with the continuous counterpart, the capability of the method to preserve the total energy of the system was demonstrated then. In the present work, we show that the modified methodology is capable of preserving the dissipation of energy of the extended continuous model. We note that the discrete energy functional is positive, a fact which is in agreement with the positivity of the continuous energy. Moreover, the unique solubility of the method is established, and we show that our technique is second-order consistent, stable and quadratically convergent.

To create the solutions of Maple symbolic package is used. Using suitable mathematical assumptions and Hirota’s bilinear technique, the new types of M-soliton and N-soliton solutions are derived and established in view of the hyperbolic, trigonometric, and rational functions of the governing equation. To achieve this, an illustrative example of the nonlinear wave equation in a liquid with gas bubbles is provided to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the procedure used in this study.

0,Nanoptera in Higher-Order Nonlinear Schrödinger Equations: Effects of Discretization,"We consider generalizations of nonlinear Schrödinger equations, which we call “Karpman equations,” that include additional linear higher-order derivatives. Singularly-perturbed Karpman equations produce generalized solitary waves (GSWs) in the form of solitary waves with exponentially small oscillatory tails. Nanoptera are a special type of GSW in which the oscillatory tails do not decay. Previous research on continuous third-order and fourth-order Karpman equations has shown that nanoptera occur in specific settings. We use exponential asymptotic techniques to identify traveling nanoptera in singularly-perturbed continuous Karpman equations. We then study the effect of discretization on nanoptera by applying a finite-difference discretization to continuous Karpman equations and examining traveling-wave solutions. The finite-difference discretization turns a continuous Karpman equation into an advance–delay equation, which we study using exponential asymptotic analysis. By comparing nanoptera in these discrete Karpman equations with nanoptera in their continuous counterparts, we show that the oscillation amplitudes and periods in the nanoptera tails differ in the continuous and discrete equations. We also show that the parameter values at which there is a bifurcation between nanopteron solutions and decaying oscillatory solutions depends on the choice of discretization. Finally, by comparing different higher-order discretizations of the fourth-order Karpman equation, we show that the bifurcation value tends to a nonzero constant for large orders, rather than to 0 as in the associated continuous Karpman equation.

0,Analysis of a Two-Fluid Taylor–Couette Flow with One Non-Newtonian Fluid,"We study the dynamic behaviour of two viscous fluid films confined between two concentric cylinders rotating at a small relative velocity. It is assumed that the fluids are immiscible and that the volume of the outer fluid film is large compared to the volume of the inner one. Moreover, while the outer fluid is considered to have constant viscosity, the rheological behaviour of the inner thin film is determined by a strain-dependent power-law. Starting from a Navier–Stokes system, we formally derive evolution equations for the interface separating the two fluids. Two competing effects drive the dynamics of the interface, namely the surface tension and the shear stresses induced by the rotation of the cylinders. When the two effects are comparable, the solutions behave, for large times, as in the Newtonian regime. We also study the regime in which the surface tension effects dominate the stresses induced by the rotation of the cylinders. In this case, we prove local existence of positive weak solutions both for shear-thinning and shear-thickening fluids. In the latter case, we show that interfaces which are initially close to a circle converge to a circle in finite time and keep that shape for later times.","Christina Lienstromberg1, Tania Pernas-Castaño1 & Juan J.

0,A birth–death model of ageing: from individual-based dynamics to evolutive differential inclusions,"Ageing’s sensitivity to natural selection has long been discussed because of its apparent negative effect on an individual’s fitness. Thanks to the recently described (Smurf) 2-phase model of ageing (Tricoire and Rera in PLoS ONE 10(11):e0141920, 2015) we propose a fresh angle for modeling the evolution of ageing. Indeed, by coupling a dramatic loss of fertility with a high-risk of impending death—amongst other multiple so-called hallmarks of ageing—the Smurf phenotype allowed us to consider ageing as a couple of sharp transitions. The birth–death model (later called bd-model) we describe here is a simple life-history trait model where each asexual and haploid individual is described by its fertility period \(x_b\) and survival period \(x_d\). We show that, thanks to the Lansing effect, the effect through which the “progeny of old parents do not live as long as those of young parents”, \(x_b\) and \(x_d\) converge during evolution to configurations \(x_b-x_d\approx 0\) in finite time. To do so, we built an individual-based stochastic model which describes the age and trait distribution dynamics of such a finite population. Then we rigorously derive the adaptive dynamics models, which describe the trait dynamics at the evolutionary time-scale. We extend the Trait Substitution Sequence with age structure to take into account the Lansing effect. Finally, we study the limiting behaviour of this jump process when mutations are small. We show that the limiting behaviour is described by a differential inclusion whose solutions \(x(t)=(x_b(t),x_d(t))\) reach the diagonal \(\lbrace x_b=x_d\rbrace \) in finite time and then remain on it. This differential inclusion is a natural way to extend the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics in order to take into account the lack of regularity of the invasion fitness function on the diagonal \(\lbrace x_b=x_d\rbrace \).

This equation has been extensively studied in the literature, describing plenty of interesting behavior, such as global existence in the space \(H^1\times H^2\), existence of super luminal solitons, and lack of a standard stability method to describe perturbations of solitons. The associated decay problem has been studied by Liu, and more recently by Cho–Ozawa, showing scattering in weighted spaces provided the power of the nonlinearity p is sufficiently large. In this paper we remove that condition on the power p and prove decay to zero in terms of the energy space norm \(L^2\times H^1\), for any \(p>1\), in two almost complementary regimes: (1) outside the light cone for all small, bounded in time \(H^1\times H^2\) solutions, and (2) decay on compact sets of arbitrarily large bounded in time \(H^1\times H^2\) solutions. The proof consists in finding two new virial type estimates, one for the exterior cone problem based in the energy of the solution, and a more subtle virial identity for the interior cone problem, based in a modification of the momentum.","Christopher Maulén1,2 & Claudio Muñoz1,",SN Partial Differential Equations and Applications,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42985-019-0002-0,"35Q35,35Q53"

0,Regularizing Piecewise Smooth Differential Systems: Co-Dimension \(2\) Discontinuity Surface,"In this paper, we are concerned with numerical solution of piecewise smooth initial value problems. Of specific interest is the case when the discontinuities occur on a smooth manifold of co-dimension 2, intersection of two co-dimension 1 singularity surfaces, and which is nodally attractive for nearby dynamics. In this case of a co-dimension 2 attracting sliding surface, we will give some results relative to two prototypical time and space regularizations. We will show that, unlike the case of co-dimension 1 discontinuity surface, in the case of co-dimension 2 discontinuity surface the behavior of the regularized problems is strikingly different. On the one hand, the time regularization approach will not select a unique sliding mode on the discontinuity surface, thus maintaining the general ambiguity of how to select a Filippov vector field in this case. On the other hand, the proposed space regularization approach is not ambiguous, and there will always be a unique solution associated to the regularized vector field, which will remain close to the original co-dimension 2 surface. We will further clarify the limiting behavior (as the regularization parameter goes to 0) of the proposed space regularization to the solution associated to the sliding vector field of Dieci and Lopez (Numer Math 117:779–811, 2011).

0,Algorithms for Symmetric Differential Systems," Over-determined systems of partial differential equations may be studied using differential—elimination algorithms, as a great deal of information about the solution set of the system may be obtained from the output. Unfortunately, many systems are effectively intractable by these methods due to the expression swell incurred in the intermediate stages of the calculations. This can happen when, for example, the input system depends on many variables and is invariant under a large rotation group, so that there is no natural choice of term ordering in the elimination and reduction processes. This paper describes how systems written in terms of the differential invariants of a Lie group action may be processed in a manner analogous to differential—elimination algorithms. The algorithm described terminates and yields, in a sense which we make precise, a complete set of representative invariant integrability conditions which may be calculated in a ``critical pair'' completion procedure. Further, we discuss some of the profound differences between algebras of differential invariants and standard differential algebras. We use the new, regularized moving frame method of Fels and Olver [11], [12] to write a differential system in terms of the invariants of a symmetry group. The methods described have been implemented as a package in \MAPLE.

It is a slow-developing, fatal disease which is rare in the free-ranging deer population of Utah. We present a sex-structured, spatial model for the spread of CWD over heterogeneous landscapes, incorporating both horizontal and environmental transmission pathways. To connect the local movement of deer to the regional spread of CWD, we use ecological diffusion with motility coefficients estimated from mule deer movement data. Ecological diffusion allows for aggregation of populations in desirable habitats and therefore allows for an interaction between density dependent disease transmission and landscape structure. The major innovation presented is use of homogenization to accelerate simulations of disease spread in southeastern Utah, from the La Sal Mountains near Moab to the Abajo Mountains near Monticello. The homogenized model provides accuracy while maintaining fidelity to small-scale habitat effects on deer distribution, including differential aggregation in land cover types with high residence times, with errors comparable to the order parameter measuring separation of small and large scales (\(\epsilon \approx .01\) in this case). We use the averaged coefficients from the homogenized model to explore asymptotic invasion speed and the impact of current population size on disease spread in southeastern Utah.","Martha J.

The compact formulation is derived with three grid points in each spatial direction and results in a block-block tri-diagonal Jacobian matrix, which makes it more suitable for efficient computing. In each direction, there are two tuning parameters; one associated with exponential basis, known as the frequency parameter, and the other one is the grid ratio parameter that appears in exponential expanding grid sequences. The interplay of these parameters provides more accurate solution values in short computing time with less memory space, and their estimates are determined according to the location of layer concentration. The Jacobian iteration matrix of the proposed scheme is proved to be monotone and irreducible.

In spite of its importance, exact solution to this nonlinear equation are rarely found in literature. In this work, we solve this equation and present a new approach to obtain the solution by means of the combined use of the Adomian decomposition method and the Laplace transform (LADM). Besides, we illustrate our approach solving two examples in which, two initial photon distributions, well known in astrophysics, are given.

0,"Differential Equations in a Tangent Category I: Complete Vector Fields, Flows, and Exponentials","This paper describes how to define and work with differential equations in the abstract setting of tangent categories. The key notion is that of a curve object which is, for differential geometry, the structural analogue of a natural number object. A curve object is a preinitial object for dynamical systems; dynamical systems may, in turn, be viewed as determining systems of differential equations. The unique map from the curve object to a dynamical system is a solution of the system, and a dynamical system is said to be complete when for all initial conditions there is a solution. A subtle issue concerns the question of when a dynamical system is complete, and the paper provides abstract conditions for this. This abstract formulation also allows new perspectives on topics such as commutative vector fields and flows. In addition, the stronger notion of a differential curve object, which is the centrepiece of the last section of the paper, has exponential maps and forms a differential exponential rig. This rig then, somewhat surprisingly, has an action on every differential object and bundle in the setting. In this manner, in a very strong sense, such a curve object plays the role of the real numbers in standard differential geometry.

that they are divergent when \(|c|\) is large. In

remainder to obtain approximants to the exact solution. Since
the equation under consideration has unbounded time lags, it
is in general difficult to investigate numerically the long time
dynamical behaviour of the exact solution due to limited computer

transform the equation under consideration into a neutral

Precisely, we are interested in Lagrangian or Hamiltonian structures and thus with variational problems attached to a least action principle. Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) deriving from a variational principle. A natural question is to know whether this structure is preserved at the discrete level when discretising the PDE. To address this question, a concept of coherence is introduced. Both the differential equation (the PDE translating the least action principle) and the variational structure can be embedded at the discrete level. This provides two discrete embeddings for the original problem. If these procedures finally provide the same discrete problem, we will say that the discretisation is coherent. Our purpose is illustrated with the Poisson problem. Coherence for discrete embeddings of Lagrangian structures is studied for various classical discretisations. For Hamiltonian structures, we show the coherence between a discrete Hamiltonian and the discretisation of the mixed formulation of the Poisson problem.","Jacky Cresson1, Isabelle Greff1 & Charles Pierre",Acta Mathematica Vietnamica,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40306-018-0257-0,"PDE discretisation,Variational integrators,Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems,Discrete embeddings"

Commun Part Differ Equ 7:1–33, 2021). In particular, given a polyconvex integrand f, we define a set of matrices \(C_f\) that allows us to rewrite the stationarity condition for a graph with multiplicity as a differential inclusion. Then we prove that if f is assumed to be non-negative, then in \(C_f\) there is no \(T'_N\) configuration, thus recovering the main result of De Lellis et al. (Geometric measure theory and differential inclusions, 2019. arXiv:1910.00335) as a corollary. Finally, we show that if the hypothesis of non-negativity is dropped, one can not only find \(T'_N\) configurations in \(C_f\), but it is also possible to construct via convex integration a very degenerate stationary point with multiplicity.

0,On partial likelihood and the construction of factorisable transformations,"Models whose associated likelihood functions fruitfully factorise are an important minority allowing elimination of nuisance parameters via partial likelihood, an operation that is valuable in both Bayesian and frequentist inferences, particularly when the number of nuisance parameters is not small. After some general discussion of partial likelihood, we focus on marginal likelihood factorisations, which are particularly difficult to ascertain from elementary calculations. We suggest a systematic approach for deducing transformations of the data, if they exist, whose marginal likelihood functions are free of the nuisance parameters. This is based on the solution to an integro-differential equation constructed from aspects of the Laplace transform of the probability density function, for which candidate solutions solve a simpler first-order linear homogeneous differential equation. The approach is generalised to the situation in which such factorisable structure is not exactly present. Examples are used in illustration. Although motivated by inferential problems in statistics, the proposed construction is of independent interest and may find application elsewhere.","H. S. Battey

The initial condition is taken to be a measure on \({\mathbb {R}}\), such as the Dirac delta function, but this measure may also have non-compact support. Existence and uniqueness, as well as upper and lower bounds on all pth moments \((p\ge 2)\), are obtained. These bounds are uniform in the spatial variable, which answers an open problem mentioned in Conus and Khoshnevisan (Probab Theory Relat Fields 152(3–4):681–701, 2012). We improve the weak intermittency statement by Foondun and Khoshnevisan (Electron J Probab 14(21):548–568, 2009), and we show that the growth indices (of linear type) introduced in Conus and Khoshnevisan (Probab Theory Relat Fields 152(3–4):681–701, 2012) are infinite.

Compared to the standard mixed method for PIDE, the present method does not bank on a reformulation using a resolvent operator. Based on energy arguments combined with a repeated use of an integral operator and without using parabolic type duality technique, optimal \(L^2\)-error estimates are derived for semidiscrete approximations, when the initial condition is in \(L^2\). Due to the presence of the integral term, it is, further, observed that a negative norm estimate plays a crucial role in our error analysis. Moreover, the proposed analysis follows the spirit of the proof techniques used in deriving optimal error estimates for finite element approximations to PIDE with smooth data and therefore, it unifies both the theories, i.e., one for smooth data and other for nonsmooth data. Finally, we extend the proposed analysis to the standard mixed method for PIDE with rough initial data and provide an optimal error estimate in \(L^2,\) which improves upon the results available in the literature.","Deepjyoti Goswami1, Amiya K.

The holomorphic solution and conditions of solvability are obtained via the method of regularization. Our approach of solving equations is novel and effective, which is different from the classical method. Meanwhile, we also discuss the asymptotic stability of solutions.

More precisely, we prove that the value function and the optimal control law can be represented by means of the solution of a class of BSDEs driven by a semi-Markov process or, equivalently, by the associated random measure. We also introduce a suitable Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. With respect to the pure jump Markov framework, the HJB equation in the semi-Markov case is characterized by an additional differential term \(\partial _a\). Taking into account the particular structure of semi-Markov processes, we rewrite the HJB equation in a suitable integral form which involves a directional derivative operator D related to \(\partial _a\). Then, using a formula of It\(\hat{\text{ o }}\) type tailor-made for semi-Markov processes and the operator D, we are able to prove that a BSDE of the above-mentioned type provides the unique classical solution to the HJB equation, which identifies the value function of our control problem.","Elena Bandini1 & Fulvia Confortola

This model is investigated by the aid of fully shifted Jacobi’s collocation method with two independent approaches. The first is discretization of the spatial variable, while the other is discretization of the temporal variable. It is concluded that the method of the current paper is far more efficient and reliable for the considered model. Numerical results illustrate the performance efficiency of the algorithm.

0,Numerical Solution of a Quasilinear Parabolic Equation with a Fractional Time Derivative,AbstractA homogeneous Dirichlet initial-boundary value problem for a quasilinear parabolic equation with Caputo fractional time derivative is considered. The coefficients of the elliptic part of the equation depend on the derivatives of the solution and satisfy the conditions providing strong monotonicity and Lipschitz-continuity of the corresponding operator. The equation is approximated by two finite-difference schemes: implicit and fractional step scheme. The stability of these finite difference schemes is proved and accuracy estimates are obtained under the condition of sufficient smoothness of the input data and the solution of the differential problem. A number of iterative methods for implementing the constructed nonlinear mesh problems are analyzed. The convergence and convergence rate of the iterative methods are substantiated.

The main motivation at the basis of this study is that the interaction among multiple energy carriers progressively gains significance as the observation scales reduce and has, as a direct consequence, the involvement of high-order terms in the time differential dual-phase-lag heat conduction constitutive equation. Considering inhomogeneous and anisotropic linear thermoelastic materials, we are able to prove three uniqueness results through the use of appropriate integral operators and Lagrange identities; the results are proved without any restriction imposed on the delay times other than their positivity.","Vittorio Zampoli

Different types of MPE are characterized distinguishing between delay equilibria, inducing for some initial conditions mode switches after a positive finite delay, and now or never equilibria, under which, depending on the initial condition, a mode switch occurs immediately or never. These results are applied to analyze the MPE of a game capturing the dynamic interaction between two incumbent firms among which one has to decide when to extend its product range by introducing a new product. The market appeal of the new product can be influenced over time by both firms through costly investments.

In this paper, we propose a powerful and accurate local meshless algorithm to solve the time-fractional Perona–Malik model which has an adjustable fractional derivative making the control of the diffusion process more convenient than the classical one. In order to overcome the complexities of the problem, a suitable combination of the compactly supported radial basis function method and operator splitting technique is proposed to convert a complex time-fractional partial differential equation into sparse linear algebraic systems that standard solvers can solve.

The nonlinearity is especially characterized by Lipschitz-continuity and growth-boundedness. Moreover, suitable initial and Neumann boundary conditions are introduced. Referring to the concept of a variational solution throughout this work, the existence and uniqueness of such a solution of the Schrödinger problem will be investigated. The main goal is to minimize a given objective functional by an optimal control. However, the objective functional depends on the solution of the controlled Schrödinger problem and the control itself. Therefore, the adjoint equation (of the stochastic Schrödinger equation) with appropriate final and Neumann boundary conditions is required. Based on a generalized solution of this adjoint problem and some important estimates concerning the difference of two solutions of the Schrödinger problem corresponding to two controls, a gradient formula in the sense of Gâteaux is calculated.

0,Initial-value problems for linear partial difference equations,"The method presented in [4] for the solution of linear difference equations in a single variable is extended to some equations in two variables. Every linear combination of a given functionf and of its partial differences can be obtained by the discrete convolution product off by a suitable functionl (which depends on the considered linear combination), and we want to solve in a convolutional form difference equations in the whole plane. However, the convolution of two functions may not be possible if their supports contain half straight lines with opposite directions. To avoid this, we take four sets of functions corresponding to the quadrants such thatl belong to every set, every set endowed with the convolution and with the usual addition is a ring, and there is an inverse ofl in each of the four rings. This is attained by taking, for each ring, a set of functions whose supports belong to suitable cones. After choosing such rings, a very natural initial-value first-order Cauchy Problem (in partial differences) is reduced to a convolutional form.

The weak coupling is characterized in terms of a small perturbation parameter ε. With ε=0, the problem decomposes into two independent standard optimal control problems, while for ε≠0, even though it is possible to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions to be satisfied by a Nash equilibrium solution, it is not always possible to construct such a solution. In this paper, we develop an iterative scheme to obtain an approximate Nash solution when ε lies in a small interval around zero. Further, after requiring strong time consistency and/or robustness of the Nash equilibrium solution when at least one of the players uses dynamic information, we address the issues of existence and uniqueness of these solutions for the cases when both players use the same information, either closed loop or open loop, and when one player uses open-loop information and the other player uses closed-loop information. We also show that, even though the original problem is nonlinear, the higher (than zero) order terms in the Nash equilibria can be obtained as solutions to LQ optimal control problems or static quadratic optimization problems.",R.

Two families of solutions in the local case are given by the sign-definite dnoidal and sign-indefinite cnoidal solutions. Both solutions can be characterized in the general fractional case as global minimizers of the quadratic part of the energy functional subject to the fixed \(L^4\) norm: the sign-definite (sign-indefinite) solutions are obtained in the subspace of even (odd) functions. Morse index is computed for both solutions and the spectral stability criterion is derived.

0,Exponential Functions in Cartesian Differential Categories,"In this paper, we introduce differential exponential maps in Cartesian differential categories, which generalizes the exponential function \(e^x\) from classical differential calculus. A differential exponential map is an endomorphism which is compatible with the differential combinator in such a way that generalizations of \(e^0 = 1\), \(e^{x+y} = e^x e^y\), and \(\frac{\partial e^x}{\partial x} = e^x\) all hold. Every differential exponential map induces a commutative rig, which we call a differential exponential rig, and conversely, every differential exponential rig induces a differential exponential map. In particular, differential exponential maps can be defined without the need of limits, converging power series, or unique solutions of certain differential equations—which most Cartesian differential categories do not necessarily have. That said, we do explain how every differential exponential map does provide solutions to certain differential equations, and conversely how in the presence of unique solutions, one can derivative a differential exponential map. Examples of differential exponential maps in the Cartesian differential category of real smooth functions include the exponential function, the complex exponential function, the split complex exponential function, and the dual numbers exponential function. As another source of interesting examples, we also study differential exponential maps in the coKleisli category of a differential category.","Jean-Simon Pacaud Lemay

Parallelization is performed for a two-step iterative algorithm for solving a system of mesh equations. The first step is a simple iteration. At the second step, a correction accelerating the convergence of iterations is added to the mesh values obtained at the first step. The equation for the correction is solved by the Krylov subspace method. The efficiency of the two methods of parallelization of the two-step iterative algorithm is compared. In the Block Jacobi (BJ) method, a simple iteration calculation is performed locally in each spatial subregion. The Block Seidel (BS) method performs an end-to-end analysis over the entire region.

An adaptive algorithm, based on the error indicators and successive subdivision of time steps, is proven to stop with the optimal number, N, of steps up to a problem independent factor defined in the algorithm. A version of the algorithm with decreasing tolerance also stops with the total number of steps, including all refinement levels, bounded by \(\mathcal O(N)\). The alternative version with constant tolerance stops with \(\mathcal O(N\ {\rm log}\ N)\) total steps. The global error is bounded by the tolerance parameter asymptotically as the tolerance tends to zero. For a p-th order accurate method the optimal number of adaptive steps is proportional to the p-th root of the \({{L^{{\frac{{1}}{{p+1}}}}}}\) quasi-norm of the error density, while the number of uniform steps, with the same error, is proportional to the p-th root of the larger L

0,A Stackelberg Game of Backward Stochastic Differential Equations with Applications,"This paper is concerned with a Stackelberg game of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), where the coefficients of the backward system and the cost functionals are deterministic, and the control domain is convex. Necessary and sufficient conditions of the optimality for the follower and the leader are first given for the general problem, by the stochastic maximum principles of BSDEs and forward–backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs), respectively. Then, a linear quadratic (LQ) Stackelberg game of BSDEs is investigated under standard assumptions. The state feedback representation for the optimal control of the follower is first given via two Riccati equations. Then, the leader’s problem is formulated as an optimal control problem of FBSDE with the control-independent diffusion term. Two high-dimensional Riccati equations are introduced to represent the state feedback for the optimal control of the leader. The solvability of the four Riccati equations are discussed. Theoretical results are applied to a pension fund problem of two players in the financial market.","Yueyang Zheng1 & Jingtao Shi

In this manuscript, we develop a model of collagen accumulation as a marker of wound healing. The mathematical model is a system of ordinary differential equations which tracks fibroblasts, collagen, inflammation and pathogens. The model was validated by comparison to the normal time course of wound healing where appropriate activity for the inflammatory, proliferative and remodeling phases was recorded. Further validation was made by comparison to collagen accumulation experiments by Madden and Peacock (Ann. Surg. 174(3):511–520, 1971). The model was then used to investigate the impact of local oxygen levels on wound healing. Finally, we present a comparison of two wound healing therapies, antibiotics and increased fibroblast proliferation.

In this work, we formulate a delay differential equation model, including both the larval and adult stages of wild mosquitoes, to assess the impacts of CI intensity ξ and mating competitiveness θ of infected males on the suppression efficiency. Our analysis identifies a CI intensity threshold ξ* below which a successful suppression is impossible. When ξ ≥ ξ*, the wild population will be eliminated ultimately if the releasing level exceeds the release amount threshold R* uniformly. The dependence of R* on ξ and θ, and the impact of temperature on suppression are further exhibited through numerical examples. Our analyses indicate that a slight reduction of ξ is more devastating than significantly decrease of θ in the suppression efficiency. To suppress more than 95% wild mosquitoes during the peak season of dengue in Guangzhou, the optimal starting date for releasing is sensitive to ξ but almost independent of θ. One percent reduction of ξ from 1 requires at least one week earlier in the optimal releasing starting date from 7 weeks ahead of the peak season of dengue.",Mu-gen Huang1 & Jian-she Yu,"Acta Mathematicae Applicatae Sinica, English Series",2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10255-022-1021-8,"dengue fever,

0,Structural identifiability analysis of age-structured PDE epidemic models,"Computational and mathematical models rely heavily on estimated parameter values for model development. Identifiability analysis determines how well the parameters of a model can be estimated from experimental data. Identifiability analysis is crucial for interpreting and determining confidence in model parameter values and to provide biologically relevant predictions. Structural identifiability analysis, in which one assumes data to be noiseless and arbitrarily fine-grained, has been extensively studied in the context of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, but has not yet been widely explored for age-structured partial differential equation (PDE) models. These models present additional difficulties due to increased number of variables and partial derivatives as well as the presence of boundary conditions. In this work, we establish a pipeline for structural identifiability analysis of age-structured PDE models using a differential algebra framework and derive identifiability results for specific age-structured models. We use epidemic models to demonstrate this framework because of their wide-spread use in many different diseases and for the corresponding parallel work previously done for ODEs. In our application of the identifiability analysis pipeline, we focus on a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected model for which we compare identifiability results for a PDE and corresponding ODE system and explore effects of age-dependent parameters on identifiability. We also show how practical identifiability analysis can be applied in this example.","Marissa Renardy

The method is explicit, fourth-order in time and spectral order in space. It is unconditionally stable and conserves the total probability in the discretized level. It is called a compact time-splitting method since, at each time step, the number of substeps in \(S_\mathrm{4c}\) is much less than those of the standard fourth-order splitting method and the fourth-order partitioned Runge–Kutta splitting method. Another advantage of \(S_\mathrm{4c}\) is that it avoids to use negative time steps in integrating subproblems at each time interval. Comparison between \(S_\mathrm{4c}\) and many other existing time-splitting methods for the Dirac equation is carried out in terms of accuracy and efficiency as well as longtime behavior. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage in terms of efficiency and accuracy of the proposed \(S_\mathrm{4c}\). Finally, we report the spatial/temporal resolutions of \(S_\mathrm{4c}\) for the Dirac equation in different parameter regimes including the nonrelativistic limit regime, the semiclassical limit regime, and the simultaneously nonrelativistic and massless limit regime.","Weizhu Bao

0,Formal Theory of Cornered Asymptotically Hyperbolic Einstein Metrics,"This paper makes a formal study of asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein metrics given, as conformal infinity, a conformal manifold with boundary. The space on which such an Einstein metric exists thus has a finite boundary in addition to the usual infinite boundary and a corner where the two meet. On the finite boundary, a constant mean curvature umbilic condition is imposed. First, recent work of Nozaki, Takayanagi, and Ugajin is generalized and extended showing that such metrics cannot have smooth compactifications for generic corners embedded in the infinite boundary. A model linear problem is then studied: a formal expansion at the corner is derived for eigenfunctions of the scalar Laplacian subject to certain boundary conditions. In doing so, scalar ODEs are studied that are of relevance for a broader class of boundary value problems and also for the Einstein problem. Next, unique formal existence at the corner, up to order at least equal to the boundary dimension, of Einstein metrics in a cornered asymptotically hyperbolic normal form which are polyhomogeneous in polar coordinates is demonstrated for arbitrary smooth conformal infinity. Finally it is shown that, in the special case that the finite boundary is taken to be totally geodesic, there is an obstruction to existence beyond this order, which defines a conformal hypersurface invariant.","Stephen E.

0,Algorithm for Overcoming the Curse of Dimensionality For Time-Dependent Non-convex Hamilton–Jacobi Equations Arising From Optimal Control and Differential Games Problems,"In this paper we develop a parallel method for solving possibly non-convex time-dependent Hamilton–Jacobi equations arising from optimal control and differential game problems. The subproblems are independent so they can be implemented in an embarrassingly parallel fashion, which usually has an ideal parallel speedup. The algorithm is proposed to overcome the curse of dimensionality (Bellman in Adaptive control processes: a guided tour. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1961; Dynamic programming. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1957) when solving HJ PDE . We extend previous work Chow et al. (Algorithm for overcoming the curse of dimensionality for certain non-convex Hamilton–Jacobi equations, Projections and differential games, UCLA CAM report, pp 16–27, 2016) and Darbon and Osher (Algorithms for overcoming the curse of dimensionality for certain Hamilton–Jacobi equations arising in control theory and elsewhere, UCLA CAM report, pp 15–50, 2015) and apply a generalized Hopf formula to solve HJ PDE involving time-dependent and perhaps non-convex Hamiltonians. We suggest a coordinate descent method for the minimization procedure in the Hopf formula. This method is preferable when even the evaluation of the function value itself requires some computational effort, and also when we handle higher dimensional optimization problem. For an integral with respect to time inside the generalized Hopf formula, we suggest using a numerical quadrature rule. Together with our suggestion to perform numerical differentiation to minimize the number of calculation procedures in each iteration step, we are bound to have numerical errors in our computations. These errors can be effectively controlled by choosing an appropriate mesh-size in time and the method does not use a mesh in space. The use of multiple initial guesses is suggested to overcome possibly multiple local extrema in the case when non-convex Hamiltonians are considered. Our method is expected to have wide application in control theory and differential game problems, and elsewhere.","Yat Tin Chow1, Jérôme Darbon2, Stanley Osher1 & …Wotao Yin",Journal of Scientific Computing,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-017-0436-5,"Hamilton–Jacobi equations,Hopf–Lax formula,Optimal control,Differential game"

For negative values of order, it can be considered as a lattice fractional integration. For integer orders, the continuum limit of the united lattice derivatives gives the usual partial derivatives of integer orders. In contrast to the usual lattice derivatives, which are proposed in our recent paper (“Lattice fractional calculus”, Appl. Math.

The united lattice integro-differentiation is represented by finite differences with infinite series that describe long-range lattice interactions.

As in repeated games with lack of information on both sides (Aumann and Maschler in Repeated games with incomplete information, with the collaboration of R. Stearns, 1995), each player receives a private signal (his type) before the game starts and has a prior belief about his opponent’s type. Then, a differential game is played in which the dynamic and the payoff functions depend on both types: each player is thus partially informed about the differential game that is played. The existence of the value function and some characterizations have been obtained under the assumption that the signals are drawn independently. In this paper, we drop this assumption and extend these results to the general case of correlated types. As an application, we provide a new characterization of the asymptotic value of repeated games with incomplete information on both sides, as the unique dual solution of a Hamilton–Jacobi equation.",Miquel Oliu-Barton,Dynamic Games and Applications,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13235-014-0131-1,"Differential games,Fenchel duality,Incomplete information,Comparison principle,Value function,Viscosity solutions"

The proof is based on a modified Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM) iterative scheme. We will, at every step of KAM iteration, construct a symplectic transformation in a such way that the composition of these transformations reduce the original system to a new system which possesses zero as equilibrium. Note that we allow \(\alpha \) to be any irrational numbers, and thus the frequency \(\omega =(1,\alpha )\) is beyond Diophantine or Brjuno frequency, which we call as Liouvillean frequency. Moreover, the model under consideration is ill-posed and has complicated Hamiltonian structure. This makes homological equations appearing in KAM iteration are different from the ones in the classical infinite-dimensional KAM theory.

The key point is to characterize the saddle points of the action as minimizers of another functional that allows us to use a gradient flow. We combine this approach with a continuation method in speed in order to obtain the full range of velocities. Through various examples, we show that even though the nonlinearity has the same behaviour as the well-known Gross–Pitaevskii nonlinearity, the qualitative properties of the travelling waves may be extremely different.

Those eigenfunctions can be used to express the analytical solution of some linear sequential fractional differential equations. As a first application, we discuss analytical solutions for the so-called fractional Helmholtz equation with one variable, obtained from the standard equation in one dimension by replacing the integer order derivative by the Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative. A second application consists of an initial value problem for a fractional wave equation in two dimensions in which the integer order partial derivative with respect to the time variable is replaced by the Caputo fractional derivative. The classical Mittag-Leffler functions are important in the theory of fractional calculus because they emerge as solutions of fractional differential equations. Starting with the solution of a specific fractional differential equation in terms of these functions, we find a way to express the exponential function in terms of classical Mittag-Leffler functions. A remarkable characteristic of this relation is that it is true for any value of the parameter n appearing in the definition of the functions, i.e., we have an infinite family of different expressions for \(e^x\) in terms of classical Mittag-Leffler functions.","Eliana Contharteze Grigoletto

To show the uniqueness we generalize the fact that every flat connection admits horizontal sections to the case of an infinite dimensional super algebra bundle defined over an infinite dimensional super space. The usual KP system with non-commutative coefficients is also studied. The KP system is obtained from the super KP system by reduction modulo odd variables. On the other hand, the first modified KP equation can be obtained from the super KP system by elimination of odd variables.

We show that Darboux transformations with the periodic eigenfunctions remain in the class of the same periodic travelling waves of the mKdV equation. In a general setting, there exist three symmetric pairs of simple eigenvalues away from the imaginary axis, and we give a new representation of the second non-periodic solution to the Lax equations for the same eigenvalues. We show that Darboux transformations with the non-periodic solutions to the Lax equations produce rogue waves on the periodic background, which are either brought from infinity by propagating algebraic solitons or formed in a finite region of the time-space plane.

0,On the Advantages of Nonstandard Finite Difference Discretizations for Differential Problems,"AbstractThe goal of this work is to highlight the advantages of using NonStandard Finite Difference (NSFD) numerical schemes for the solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) of which some properties of the exact solution, such as positivity, are a priori known. The main reference considered is Mickens’ work [14], in which the author derives NSFD schemes for ODEs and PDEs that describe real phenomena and, therefore, widely used in applications. We rigorously demonstrate that NSFD methods can have a higher order of convergence than the related classical ones, deriving also conditions that guarantee the stability of the analyzed schemes. Furthermore, we carry out in-depth numerical tests comparing classical methods with the NSFD ones proposed by Mickens, evaluating when the latter are decidedly advantageous.","D. Conte1, N.

0,Entropy stable h/p-nonconforming discretization with the summation-by-parts property for the compressible Euler and Navier–Stokes equations,"In this paper, we extend the entropy conservative/stable algorithms presented by Del Rey Fernández et al. (2019) for the compressible Euler and Navier–Stokes equations on nonconforming p-refined/coarsened curvilinear grids to h/p refinement/coarsening. The main difficulty in developing nonconforming algorithms is the construction of appropriate coupling procedures across nonconforming interfaces. Here, we utilize a computationally simple and efficient approach based upon using decoupled interpolation operators. The resulting scheme is entropy conservative/stable and element-wise conservative. Numerical simulations of the isentropic vortex and viscous shock propagation confirm the entropy conservation/stability and accuracy properties of the method (achieving \(\sim p+1\) convergence), which are comparable to those of the original conforming scheme (Carpenter et al. in SIAM J Sci Comput 36(5):B835–B867, 2014; Parsani et al. in SIAM J Sci Comput 38(5):A3129–A3162, 2016). Simulations of the Taylor–Green vortex at \(\hbox {Re}=1600\) and turbulent flow past a sphere at \(\hbox {Re}_{\infty }=2000\) show the robustness and stability properties of the overall spatial discretization for unstructured grids. Finally, to demonstrate the entropy conservation property of a fully-discrete explicit entropy stable algorithm with h/p refinement/coarsening, we present the time evolution of the entropy function obtained by simulating the propagation of the isentropic vortex using a relaxation Runge–Kutta scheme.","David C.

The ggBm includes some well-known stochastic processes: Brownian motion, fractional Brownian motion, and grey Brownian motion.

We prove the stability of the solution of the semi-discrete problem and its convergence to the exact solution.

0,The information geometry of two-field functional integrals,"Two-field functional integrals (2FFI) are an important class of solution methods for generating functions of dissipative processes, including discrete-state stochastic processes, dissipative dynamical systems, and decohering quantum densities. The stationary trajectories of these integrals describe a conserved current by Liouville’s theorem, despite the absence of a conserved kinematic phase space current in the underlying stochastic process. We develop the information geometry of generating functions for discrete-state classical stochastic processes in the Doi-Peliti 2FFI form, and exhibit two quantities conserved along stationary trajectories. One is a Wigner function, familiar as a semiclassical density from quantum-mechanical time-dependent density-matrix methods. The second is an overlap function, between directions of variation in an underlying distribution and those in the directions of relative large-deviation probability that can be used to interrogate the distribution, and expressed as an inner product of vector fields in the Fisher information metric. To give an interpretation to the time invertibility implied by current conservation, we use generating functions to represent importance sampling protocols, and show that the conserved Fisher information is the differential of a sample volume under deformations of the nominal distribution and the likelihood ratio. We derive a pair of dual affine connections particular to Doi-Peliti theory for the way they separate the roles of the nominal distribution and likelihood ratio, distinguishing them from the standard dually-flat connection of Nagaoka and Amari defined on the importance distribution, and show that dual flatness in the affine coordinates of the coherent-state basis captures the special role played by coherent states in Doi-Peliti theory.","Eric Smith

These equations depend on three real parameters. For special values of the parameters they specialize to various important classes of equations in differential geometry. Among them there are: the Ricci soliton equations, the vacuum near-horizon geometry equations in general relativity, special cases of Einstein–Weyl equations and their projective counterparts, equations for homotheties and Killing’s equation. We also prolong the generalized Ricci soliton equations and, by computing differential constraints, we find a number of necessary conditions for a (pseudo-) Riemannian manifold \((M, g)\) to locally admit non-trivial solutions to the generalized Ricci soliton equations in dimensions 2 and 3. The paper provides also a collection of explicit examples of generalized Ricci solitons in dimensions 2 and 3 (in some cases).",Paweł  Nurowski1 & Matthew Randall,The Journal of Geometric Analysis,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12220-015-9592-8,"Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian geometry,Overdetermined systems of PDEs,Ricci solitons,Near-horizon geometry,Einstein–Weyl equations"
0,"Numerical Factorization of Propagation Operator for Hyperbolic Equations and Application to One-way, True Amplitude One-way Equations and Bremmer Series","This paper presents a purely numerical factorization of the propagation operator for a generic hyperbolic equation, based on the work of Towne & Colonius in 2015, that does not require heavy analytical development. This method is applied to form one-way equations with the objective of computing the propagation of waves inside a medium. The main advantage of this formulation is that pseudo eigenvectors and eigenvalues matrices are built, leading to the possibility to use the one-way equations into a true amplitude formalism and/or inside a Bremmer series. These two methods allow an extension of the domain of application of the one-way equations when the medium of propagation presents variations along the privileged direction. In particular, these formulations allow to take into account the phenomena of reflection and refraction of the incident wave. Finally numerical results are presented on different 2D situations based on the linearized Euler equations and compared to the results obtained with a full wave resolution. The issues of both the accuracy and the requirements in computational resources of the one-way resolution are also addressed.","Clément Rudel

G-Strands","A G-strand is a map g(t,s):ℝ×ℝ→G for a Lie group G that follows from Hamilton’s principle for a certain class of G-invariant Lagrangians. The SO(3)-strand is the G-strand version of the rigid body equation and it may be regarded physically as a continuous spin chain. Here, SO(3)
K
-strand dynamics for ellipsoidal rotations is derived as an Euler–Poincaré system for a certain class of variations and recast as a Lie–Poisson system for coadjoint flow with the same Hamiltonian structure as for a perfect complex fluid. For a special Hamiltonian, the SO(3)
K
-strand is mapped into a completely integrable generalization of the classical chiral model for the SO(3)-strand. Analogous results are obtained for the Sp(2)-strand. The Sp(2)-strand is the G-strand version of the Sp(2) Bloch–Iserles ordinary differential equation, whose solutions exhibit dynamical sorting. Numerical solutions show nonlinear interactions of coherent wave-like solutions in both cases. Diff(ℝ)-strand equations on the diffeomorphism group G=Diff(ℝ) are also introduced and shown to admit solutions with singular support (e.g., peakons).","Darryl D. Holm1, Rossen I. Ivanov2 & James R.

0,Rogue Waves in the Generalized Derivative Nonlinear Schrödinger Equations,"General rogue waves are derived for the generalized derivative nonlinear Schrödinger (GDNLS) equations by a bilinear Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (KP) reduction method. These GDNLS equations contain the Kaup–Newell equation, the Chen–Lee–Liu equation and the Gerdjikov–Ivanov equation as special cases. In this bilinear framework, it is shown that rogue waves to all members of these equations are expressed by the same bilinear solution. Compared to previous bilinear KP reduction methods for rogue waves in other integrable equations, an important improvement in our current KP reduction procedure is a new parameterization of internal parameters in rogue waves. Under this new parameterization, the rogue wave expressions through elementary Schur polynomials are much simpler. In addition, the rogue wave with the highest peak amplitude at each order can be obtained by setting all those internal parameters to zero, and this maximum peak amplitude at order N turns out to be \(2N+1\) times the background amplitude, independent of the individual GDNLS equation and the background wavenumber. It is also reported that these GDNLS equations can be decomposed into two different bilinear systems which require different KP reductions, but the resulting rogue waves remain the same. Dynamics of rogue waves in the GDNLS equations is also analyzed. It is shown that the wavenumber of the constant background strongly affects the orientation and duration of the rogue wave. In addition, some new rogue patterns are presented.","Bo Yang1, Junchao Chen2 & Jianke Yang

Stability and temporal error estimation techniques allow acceptance of approximate solutions at intermediate stages, yielding increased efficiency when solving partial differential equations. A priori energy estimates of the local discretization error are obtained for a nonlinear scalar problem. A posteriori estimates of local spatial discretization errors, obtained by order variation, are used with the a priori error estimates to control the adaptive mesh refinement strategy. Computational results suggest convergence of the a posteriori error estimate to the exact discretization error and verify the utility of the adaptive technique.","Peter K. Moore1,2 & Joseph E.

0,Concurrent Implementation of the Optimal Incremental Approximation Method for the Adaptive and Meshless Solution of Differential Equations,"The optimal incremental function approximation method is implemented for the adaptive and meshless solution of differential equations. The basis functions and associated coefficients of a series expansion representing the solution are selected optimally at each step of the algorithm according to appropriate error minimization criteria. Thus, the solution is built incrementally. In this manner, the computational technique is adaptive in nature, although a grid is neither built nor adapted in the traditional sense using a posteriori error estimates. Since the basis functions are associated with the nodes only, the method can be viewed as a meshless method. Variational principles are utilized for the definition of the objective function to be extremized in the associated optimization problems. Complicated data structures, expensive remeshing algorithms, and systems solvers are avoided. Computational efficiency is increased by using low-order local basis functions and the parallel direct search (PDS) optimization algorithm. Numerical results are reported for both a linear and a nonlinear problem associated with fluid dynamics. Challenges and opportunities regarding the use of this method are discussed.","Michael Kokkolaras1, Andrew J.

Firstly, finding Nash equilibria for the game is greatly simplified, because it is a lot easier to deal with an OCP than with the original game itself. Secondly, the Nash equilibria obtained from the associated OCP are automatically “pure” (or deterministic) rather than “mixed” (or randomized). We restrict ourselves to open-loop differential games. We propose two different approaches to identify a PDG and to construct a corresponding OCP. As an application, we consider a PDG with a certain turnpike property that is obtained from results for the associated OCP.

We focus on the parametric estimation of such SDEs based on partial observations when only a one-dimensional component of the system is observable. We consider two families of SDE, the elliptic family with a full-rank diffusion coefficient and the hypoelliptic family with a degenerate diffusion coefficient. Estimation for the second class is much more difficult and only few estimation methods have been proposed. Here, we adopt the framework of the optimal control theory to derive a contrast (or cost function) based on the best control sequence mimicking the (unobserved) Brownian motion. We propose a full data-driven approach to estimate the drift and diffusion coefficient parameters. Numerical simulations made on different examples (Harmonic Oscillator, FitzHugh–Nagumo, Lotka–Volterra) reveal our method produces good pointwise estimate for an acceptable computational price with, interestingly, no performance drop for hypoelliptic systems.","Quentin Clairon

The FR formulation was originally proposed by Huynh (AIAA Pap 2007-4079:1–42, 2007). Vincent et al. (J Sci Comput 47(1):50–72, 2011) later developed a single parameter family of correction functions which provide energy stable schemes under this formulation in 1D. These schemes, known as Vincent–Castonguay–Jameson–Huynh (VCJH) schemes, offer control over properties like stability, dispersion and dissipation through the variation of the VCJH parameter. Classical schemes like nodal-DG and Spectral Difference (SD) can also be recovered under this formulation. Following the development of the FR approach in 1D, Castonguay et al. (J Sci Comput 51(1):224–256, 2012) and Williams et al. (J Comput Phys 250:53–76, 2013) and Williams and Jameson (J Sci Comput 59(3):721–759, 2014) developed correction functions that give rise to energy stable FR formulations for triangles and tetrahedra. For the case of tensor product elements like quadrilaterals and hexahedra however, a simple extension of the 1D FR approach utilizing the 1D VCJH correction functions was possible and has been adopted by several authors (Castonguay in High-order energy stable flux reconstruction schemes for fluid flow simulations on unstructured grids, 2012; Witherden et al. in Comput Fluids 120:173–186, 2015; Comput Phys Commun 185(11):3028–3040, 2014). But whether such an extension of the 1D approach to tensor product elements is stable remained an open question. A direct extension of the 1D stability analysis fails due to certain key difficulties which necessitate the formulation of a norm different from the one utilized for stability analysis in 1D and on simplex elements. We have recently overcome these issues and shown that the VCJH schemes are stable for the linear advection equation on Cartesian meshes for any non-negative value of the VCJH parameter (Sheshadri and Jameson in J Sci Comput 67(2):769–790, 2016; J Sci Comput 67(2):791–794, 2016). In this paper, we have extended the stability analysis to the advection–diffusion equation, demonstrating that the tensor product FR formulation is stable on Cartesian meshes for the advection–diffusion case as well. The analysis in this paper also provides additional insights into the dependence on the VCJH parameter of the diffusion and stability characteristics of these schemes. Several numerical experiments that support the theoretical results are included.","Abhishek Sheshadri

0,The HcscK equations in symplectic coordinates,"The Donaldson–Fujiki Kähler reduction of the space of compatible almost complex structures, leading to the interpretation of the scalar curvature of Kähler metrics as a moment map, can be lifted canonically to a hyperkähler reduction. Donaldson proposed to consider the corresponding vanishing moment map conditions as (fully nonlinear) analogues of Hitchin’s equations, for which the underlying bundle is replaced by a polarised manifold. However this construction is well understood only in the case of complex curves. In this paper we study Donaldson’s hyperkähler reduction on abelian varieties and toric manifolds. We obtain a decoupling result, a variational characterisation, a relation to K-stability in the toric case, and prove existence and uniqueness under suitable assumptions on the “Higgs tensor”. We also discuss some aspects of the analogy with Higgs bundles.","Carlo Scarpa

0,Small-Time Solvability of a Flow of Forward–Backward Stochastic Differential Equations,"Motivated from time-inconsistent stochastic control problems, we introduce a new type of coupled forward–backward stochastic systems, namely, flows of forward–backward stochastic differential equations. They are coupled systems consisting of a single forward SDE and a continuum of BSDEs, which are defined on different time-intervals. We formulate a notion of equilibrium solutions in a general framework and prove small-time well-posedness of the equations. We also consider discretized flows and show that their equilibrium solutions approximate the original one, together with an estimate of the convergence rate.","Yushi Hamaguchi

0,Monotone Mixed Finite Difference Scheme for Monge–Ampère Equation,"In this paper, we propose a monotone mixed finite difference scheme for solving the two-dimensional Monge–Ampère equation. In order to accomplish this, we convert the Monge–Ampère equation to an equivalent Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. Based on the HJB formulation, we apply the standard 7-point stencil discretization, which is second order accurate, to the grid points wherever monotonicity holds, and apply semi-Lagrangian wide stencil discretization elsewhere to ensure monotonicity on the entire computational domain. By dividing the admissible control set into six regions and optimizing the sub-problem in each region, the computational cost of the optimization problem at each grid point is reduced from \(O(M^2)\) to O(1) when the standard 7-point stencil discretization is applied and to O(M) otherwise, where the discretized control set is \(M\times M\). We prove that our numerical scheme satisfies consistency, stability, monotonicity and strong comparison principle, and hence is convergent to the viscosity solution of the Monge–Ampère equation. In the numerical results, second order convergence rate is achieved when the standard 7-point stencil discretization is applied monotonically on the entire computation domain, and up to order one convergence is achieved otherwise. The proposed mixed scheme yields a smaller discretization error and a faster convergence rate compared to the pure semi-Lagrangian wide stencil scheme.","Yangang Chen

0,Diffusive Limit of Transport Equation in 3D Convex Domains,"Consider neutron transport equations in 3D convex domains with in-flow boundary. We mainly study the asymptotic limits as the Knudsen number \(\epsilon \rightarrow 0^+\). Using Hilbert expansion, we rigorously justify that the solution of steady problem converges to that of Laplace’s equation, and the solution of unsteady problem converges to that of heat equation. This is the most difficult case of a long-term project on asymptotic analysis of kinetic equations in bounded domains. The proof relies on a detailed analysis on the boundary layer effect with geometric correction. The upshot of this paper is a novel boundary layer decomposition argument in 3D and \(L^2-L^{2m}-L^{\infty }\) bootstrapping method for time-dependent problem.","Lei Wu
