0,Factorization of nonlinear supersymmetry in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. I: General classification of reducibility and analysis of the third-order algebra,We study possible factorizations of supersymmetric (SUSY) transformations in the one-dimensional quantum mechanics into chains of elementary Darboux transformations with nonsingular coefficients. A classification of irreducible (almost) isospectral transformations and of related SUSY algebras is presented. A detailed analysis of SUSY algebras and isospectral operators is performed for the third-order case. Bibliography: 29 titles.,A. A. Andrianov1 & A. V.

1,Coquelicot: A User-Friendly Library of Real Analysis for Coq,"Real analysis is pervasive to many applications, if only because it is a suitable tool for modeling physical or socio-economical systems. As such, its support is warranted in proof assistants, so that the users have a way to formally verify mathematical theorems and correctness of critical systems. The Coq system comes with an axiomatization of standard real numbers and a library of theorems on real analysis. Unfortunately, this standard library is lacking some widely used results. For instance, power series are not developed further than their definition. Moreover, the definitions of integrals and derivatives are based on dependent types, which make them especially cumbersome to use in practice. To palliate these inadequacies, we have designed a user-friendly library: Coquelicot. An easier way of writing formulas and theorem statements is achieved by relying on total functions in place of dependent types for limits, derivatives, integrals, power series, and so on. To help with the proof process, the library comes with a comprehensive set of theorems that cover not only these notions, but also some extensions such as parametric integrals, two-dimensional differentiability, asymptotic behaviors. It also offers some automation for performing differentiability proofs. Moreover, Coquelicot is a conservative extension of Coq’s standard library and we provide correspondence theorems between the two libraries. We have exercised the library on several use cases: in an exam at university entry level, for the definitions and properties of Bessel functions, and for the solution of the one-dimensional wave equation.","Sylvie Boldo1, Catherine Lelay1 & Guillaume Melquiond",Mathematics in Computer Science,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11786-014-0181-1,"Standard real analysis,Coq proof assistant,Library,Generalized limits,Differentiability,Parametric integrals,Power series"
2,Hardness measures for gridworld benchmarks and performance analysis of real-time heuristic search algorithms,"Gridworlds are one of the most popular settings used in benchmark problems for real-time heuristic search algorithms. However, no comprehensive studies have been published so far on how the difference in the density of randomly positioned obstacles affects the hardness of the problems. This paper presents two measures for characterizing the hardness of gridworld problems parameterized by obstacle ratio, and relates them to the performance of the algorithms. We empirically show that the peak locations of those measures and actual performance degradation of the basic algorithms (RTA* and LRTA*) almost coincide with each other for a wide variety of problem settings. Thus the measures uncover some interesting aspects of the gridworlds.",Masataka Mizusawa1 & Masahito Kurihara,Journal of Heuristics,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10732-008-9084-0,"Real-time search,Gridworlds,Benchmark,Phase transition"

4,Cosine families and semigroups really differ,"We reveal three surprising properties of cosine families, distinguishing them from semigroups of operators: (1) A single trajectory of a cosine family is either strongly continuous or not measurable. (2) Pointwise convergence of a sequence of equibounded cosine families implies that the convergence is almost uniform for time in the entire real line; in particular, cosine families cannot be perturbed in a singular way. (3) A non-constant trajectory of a bounded cosine family does not have a limit at infinity; in particular, the rich theory of asymptotic behaviour of semigroups does not have a counterpart for cosine families. In addition, we show that equibounded cosine families that converge strongly and almost uniformly in time may fail to converge uniformly.","Adam Bobrowski1 & Wojciech Chojnacki2,",Journal of Evolution Equations,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00028-013-0208-0,"Primary 47D09,34G10,Secondary 60J65"

The Fan Theorem is true under the intended intuitionistic interpretation and Kleene’s Alternative is true in the model of BIM consisting of the Turing-computable functions. The task of finding equivalents of Kleene’s Alternative is, intuitionistically, a nontrivial extension of the task of finding equivalents of the Fan Theorem, although there is a certain symmetry in the arguments that we shall try to make transparent. We introduce closed-and-separable subsets of Baire space \({\mathcal{N}}\) and of the set \({\mathcal{R}}\) of the real numbers. Such sets may be compact and also positively noncompact. The Fan Theorem is the statement that Cantor space \({\mathcal{C}}\), or, equivalently, the unit interval [0, 1], is compact and Kleene’s Alternative is the statement that \({\mathcal{C}}\), or, equivalently, [0, 1], is positively noncompact. The class of the compact closed-and-separable sets and also the class of the closed-and-separable sets that are positively noncompact are characterized in many different ways and a host of equivalents of both the Fan Theorem and Kleene’s Alternative is found.",Wim Veldman,Archive for Mathematical Logic,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00153-014-0384-9,"Intuitionistic reverse mathematics,Fan Theorem,Weak König’s Lemma"

Via the Vessiot theory of differential equations, geometric singularities can be characterised as points where the behaviour of a certain linear system of equations changes. These points can be discovered using a specifically adapted parametric generalisation of Gaussian elimination combined with heuristic simplification techniques and real quantifier elimination methods.

8,The elementary computable functions over the real numbers: applying two new techniques,"The basic motivation behind this work is to tie together various computational complexity classes, whether over different domains such as the naturals or the reals, or whether defined in different manners, via function algebras (Real Recursive Functions) or via Turing Machines (Computable Analysis). We provide general tools for investigating these issues, using two techniques we call approximation and lifting. We use these methods to obtain two main theorems. First, we provide an alternative proof of the result from Campagnolo et al. (J Complex 18:977–1000, 2002), which precisely relates the Kalmar elementary computable functions to a function algebra over the reals. Second, we build on that result to extend a result of Bournez and Hainry (Theor Comput Sci 348(2–3):130–147, 2005), which provided a function algebra for the \({\mathcal{C}}^2\)
real elementary computable functions; our result does not require the restriction to \({\mathcal{C}}^2\) functions. In addition to the extension, we provide an alternative approach to the proof. Their proof involves simulating the operation of a Turing Machine using a function algebra. We avoid this simulation, using a technique we call lifting, which allows us to lift the classic result regarding the elementary computable functions to a result on the reals. The two new techniques bring a different perspective to these problems, and furthermore appear more easily applicable to other problems of this sort.","Manuel L.

23,A study on the use of non-parametric tests for analyzing the evolutionary algorithms’ behaviour: a case study on the CEC’2005 Special Session on Real Parameter Optimization,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest for the experimental analysis in the field of evolutionary algorithms. It is noticeable due to the existence of numerous papers which analyze and propose different types of problems, such as the basis for experimental comparisons of algorithms, proposals of different methodologies in comparison or proposals of use of different statistical techniques in algorithms’ comparison.In this paper, we focus our study on the use of statistical techniques in the analysis of evolutionary algorithms’ behaviour over optimization problems. A study about the required conditions for statistical analysis of the results is presented by using some models of evolutionary algorithms for real-coding optimization. This study is conducted in two ways: single-problem analysis and multiple-problem analysis. The results obtained state that a parametric statistical analysis could not be appropriate specially when we deal with multiple-problem results. In multiple-problem analysis, we propose the use of non-parametric statistical tests given that they are less restrictive than parametric ones and they can be used over small size samples of results. As a case study, we analyze the published results for the algorithms presented in the CEC’2005 Special Session on Real Parameter Optimization by using non-parametric test procedures.","Salvador García1, Daniel Molina2, Manuel Lozano1 & …Francisco Herrera",Journal of Heuristics,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10732-008-9080-4,"Statistical analysis of experiments,Evolutionary algorithms,Parametric tests,Non-parametric tests"

The outline and position of each organism are determined by chain coding and followed through the recorded series of images. The movement vectors of all organisms tracked are stored in the form of deviation angles from a predefined stimulus (light or gravity) direction and the distance each organism has moved in the time interval determined by the hardware clock of the computer. Subsequent programs allow one to determine circular histograms of movement directions and velocities in dependence of the movement direction.

27,"The problem of the invariance of dimension in the growth of modern topology, part II","This work examines the historical origins of topological dimension theory with special reference to the problem of the invariance of dimension. Part I, comprising chapters 1–4, concerns problems and ideas about dimension from ancient times to about 1900. Chapter 1 deals with ancient Greek ideas about dimension and the origins of theories of hyperspaces and higher-dimensional geometries relating to the subsequent development of dimension theory. Chapter 2 treatsCantor's surprising discovery that continua of different dimension numbers can be put into one-one correspondence and his discussion withDedekind concerning the discovery. The problem of the invariance of dimension originates with this discovery. Chapter 3 deals with the early efforts of 1878–1879 to prove the invariance of dimension. Chapter 4 sketches the rise of point set topology with reference to the problem of proving dimensional invariance and the development of dimension theory. Part II, comprising chapters 5–8, concerns the development of dimension theory during the early part of the twentieth century. Chapter 5 deals with new approaches to the concept of dimension and the problem of dimensional invariance. Chapter 6 analyses the origins ofBrouwer's interest in topology and his breakthrough to the first general proof of the invariance of dimension. Chapter 7 treatsLebesgue's ideas about dimension and the invariance problem and the dispute that arose betweenBrouwer andLebesgue which led toBrouwer's further work on topology and dimension. Chapter 8 offers glimpses of the development of dimension theory afterBrouwer, especially the development of the dimension theory ofUrysohn andMenger during the twenties. Chapter 8 ends with some concluding remarks about the entire history covered.",Dale M.

28,A Multiple Criteria Analysis Model For Real Estate Evaluation,"Real estate evaluation is of great importance and interest to many socio-economic agents, especially to property buyers and sellers for personal benefits, municipalities for tax purposes, financial institutions for loan policies, and to real estate brokerage firms for marketing activities. Although these agents are motivated in their actions by different objectives, even conflicting at times, they all desire to have a realistic description of the real estate market behavior in order to make right and timely decisions. This article presents an estimation model to describe the behavior of real estate markets. The model is based on certain observable real estate market data as well as on the perceptions of real estate agents who are active in the market. The parameters that describe the behavior of the real estate market are estimated, through the estimation model, using mathematical programming tools within a multiple criteria analysis context. The usefulness and applicability of the approach is empirically shown through an implementation using the data of the City of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.","Ossama Kettani1, Muhittin Oral2 & Yannis Siskos",Journal of Global Optimization,1998,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1008214528426,"Real estate appraisal,estimation methods,ordinal regression,mathematical programming,multiple criteria approach"

ℝ. Our results substantiate that most likely it does not any longer capture the difficulty of NP
ℝ in such a real number setting. More precisely, we give upper complexity bounds for the approximation problem for interval functions by locating it in (a real analogue of). This result allows several conclusions:• the problem is not (any more) NP
ℝ-hard under so called weak polynomial time reductions and likely not to be NP
ℝ-hard under (full) polynomial time reductions;• for fixed dimension the problem is polynomial time solvable; this extends the results in Koshelev et al.

33,Modelling of stock price changes: A real analysis approach,"
Abstract. In this paper a real analysis approach to stock price modelling is considered. A stock price and its return are defined in a duality to each other provided there exist suitable limits along a sequence of nested partitions of a time interval, mimicking sum and product integrals. It extends the class of stochastic processes susceptible to theoretical analysis. Also, it is shown that extended classical calculus is applicable to market analysis whenever the local 2–variation of sample functions of the return is zero, or is determined by jumps if the process is discontinuous. In particular, an extended Riemann-Stieltjes integral is used in that case to prove several properties of trading strategies.",Rimas Norvaiša,Finance and Stochastics,2000,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007800050077,"Key words: continuous–time model, model testing, stock price, return, trading strategy"

35,Analysis of equations of state for a real gas based on the notion of division of strain into free and elastic strains,"It is established that, in a general case, the equations of state of a real gas are identical to the constitutive equations of cubic strain of a deformable material. Based on this, we use the fundamental notion of deformation mechanics of the division of strain into free and elastic strain. As a result, we reduce the equation of cubic strain to the form of a generalization of the ideal gas law. We establish specific features of the gaseous state as compared with the solid and liquid states. In particular, the continuum physical meaning of an ideal gas and the universal gas constant is revealed. We construct two-parameter expressions for the compressibility coefficient for an arbitrary state of aggregation, which reveal the physical meaning of the corresponding experimental data and agree with the notions of the molecularkinetic theory of gases.",І.

36,Analysis of a Chebyshev-type spectral method for the Korteweg-de Vries equation in the real line,"Many problems in science and engineering involve nonlinear PDEs which are posed on the real line (\({\mathbb {R}}\)). Particular examples include a number of important nonlinear wave equations. A rigorous numerical analysis of such problems is especially challenging due to the spatial discretization of the nonlinear operators involved in the models. Classically, such problems have been treated using Fourier pseudo-spectral methods by truncating the spatial domain and imposing periodic boundary conditions. Unfortunately, in many cases this approach may not be appropriate to adequately capture the dynamics of the problem on the spatial domain. In this paper, we consider a Chebyshev-type pseudo-spectral method based on the algebraically mapped Chebyshev basis defined in \({\mathbb {R}}\). The approximation properties of this basis are naturally described on the scale of weighted Bessel potential spaces and lead to optimal error estimates for the method. Based on these estimates an efficient spectral scheme for solving the nonlinear Korteweg-de Vries equation globally in \({\mathbb {R}}\) is proposed. The numerical simulations presented in the paper confirm our theoretical results.",S. Shindin1 & N.

37,"The evaluation of pedestrians’ behavior using M/G/C/C analytical, weighted distance and real distance simulation models","
M/G/C/C analytical and simulation models have long been used to evaluate the performance of a large and complex topological network. However, such evaluation is only founded on a network’s total arrival rate and its weighted distance. Thus, this paper discusses some concepts and issues in building an M/G/C/C simulation model of a complex geometric system where all its arrival sources and their exact distances to the end of their networks (i.e., corridors) have been taken into consideration in measuring the impacts of various evacuation rates to its throughput, blocking probability, expected service time and expected number of pedestrians. For this purpose, the Dewan Tuanku Syed Putra hall, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia has been selected as a case study for various evaluations of complex pedestrian flows. These results were analyzed and compared with the results of our analytical and weighted distance simulation models. We then documented the ranges of arrival rates for each of the model where their results exhibited significant discrepancies and suggest ideal rates to best evacuate occupants from the hall. Our model can be utilized by policy makers to recommend suitable actions especially in emergency cases and be modified to build and measure the performance of other real-life complex systems.","Ruzelan Khalid1, Mohd.

We give a new version of Abilov’s estimates using in this case the generalized Clifford–Fourier transform in the space \(L^{2}({\mathbb {R}}^{(p,q)},{\mathcal {C}}l_{(p,q)})\) as applied to some classes of functions characterized by a generalized modulus of continuity.

The first one relates these components to the orbits of the monodromy action on the set of connected components of the Fano surface \(F_{\mathbb R}(X)\) formed by real lines on X. For another interpretation we associate with each of the 18 components a well defined real deformation class of real non-singular plane quintic curves and show that this deformation class together with the real deformation class of X characterizes completely the component.","S.

41,Stabilization by slow diffusion in a real Ginzburg-Landau system,"The Ginzburg-Landau equation is essential for understanding the dynamics of patterns in a wide variety of physical contexts. It governs the evolution of small amplitude instabilities near criticality. It is well known that the (cubic) Ginzburg-Landau equation has various unstable solitary pulse solutions. However, such localized patterns have been observed in systems in which there are two competing instability mechanisms. In such systems, the evolution of instabilities is described by a Ginzburg-Landau equation coupled to a diffusion equation.In this article we study the influence of this additional diffusion equation on the pulse solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation in light of recently developed insights into the effects of slow diffusion on the stability of pulses. Therefore, we consider the limit case of slow diffusion, i.e., the situation in which the additional diffusion equation acts on a long spatial scale. We show that the solitary pulse solution of the Ginzburg-Landau equation persists under this coupling. We use the Evans function method to analyze the effect of the slow diffusion and to show that it acts as a control mechanism that influences the (in)stability of the pulse. We establish that this control mechanism can indeed stabilize a pulse when higher order nonlinearities are taken into account.","A. Doelman1,2, G. Hek1 & N.

Real solutions of the differential equation ∂ 2/z ω = g, where the complex function g is given only up to multiplication by a positive function, are intimately related to umbilics. We determine necessary and sufficient conditions of an integral nature for real solvability of this equation, which is really a system of two wave equations. We then construct germs of line fields of every index j ∈ 1/2 ℤ on S2 that cannot be realized as the Gauss image of the principal line fields near an isolated umbilic of positive curvature on any smooth surface in ℝ3. These include the standard dipole line field of index two and controlled distortions of it.",Brian Smyth1 & Frederico Xavier,The Journal of Geometric Analysis,1998,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02921718,"Umbilic Point,Gauss Image,Puncture Disk,Singular Foliation,Unit Vector Field"
43,Large-Degree Asymptotics of Rational Painlevé-IV Solutions by the Isomonodromy Method,"The Painlevé-IV equation has two families of rational solutions generated, respectively, by the generalized Hermite polynomials and the generalized Okamoto polynomials. We apply the isomonodromy method to represent all of these rational solutions by means of two related Riemann–Hilbert problems, each of which involves two integer-valued parameters related to the two parameters in the Painlevé-IV equation. We then use the steepest-descent method to analyze the rational solutions in the limit that at least one of the parameters is large. Our analysis provides rigorous justification for formal asymptotic arguments that suggest that in general solutions of Painlevé-IV with large parameters behave either as an algebraic function or an elliptic function. Moreover, the results show that the elliptic approximation holds on the union of a curvilinear rectangle and, in the case of the generalized Okamoto rational solutions, four curvilinear triangles each of which shares an edge with the rectangle; the algebraic approximation is valid in the complementary unbounded domain. We compare the theoretical predictions for the locations of the poles and zeros with numerical plots of the actual poles and zeros obtained from the generating polynomials, and find excellent agreement.",Robert J.

Our main aim is to study the speed of convergence to zero of the remainder for a function f in terms of its distance from a space of Mellin bandlimited functions. The resulting estimates turn out to be of best possible order. Moreover, we characterize certain rates of convergence in terms of Mellin–Sobolev and Mellin–Hardy type spaces that contain f.

For a real algebraic set given by a polynomial system, the new method first constructs a square polynomial system which represents the sample points, and then solve this system by a special homotopy continuation method introduced recently by Wang, et al. (2017). For each root returned by the homotopy continuation method, which is a complex approximation of some (complex/real) root of the polynomial system, interval analysis is used to verify whether it is an approximation of a real root and finally get real points on the given real algebraic set. A new estimate on initial intervals is presented which helps compute smaller initial intervals before performing interval iteration and thus saves computation. Experiments show that the new method works pretty well on tested examples.",Yu Wang1 & Bican Xia,Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-019-8349-z,"Homotopy continuation,interval arithmetic,polynomial system,real variety"

As a formalization of the mathematical problem statement, concepts of generalized solution sets and AE-solution sets to an interval system of equations, inequalities, etc., are introduced. The major practical result of our paper is the development of a number of techniques for inner and outer estimation of the so-called AE-solution sets to interval systems of equations.

In particular, we establish the usual (i.e. semiclassical) asymptotic expansion of this star restriction, and further obtain a real- variable analogue of a theorem of Arazy and Ørsted concerning the analogous expansion for the Berezin transform.","Miroslav Engliš1,2 & Harald Upmeier",Mathematische Zeitschrift,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00209-010-0702-9,"Bounded symmetric domain,Toeplitz operator,Star product,Covariant quantization"

On the other hand, out of many ways to construct a dependent random polynomial, one is to force the coefficients to be palindromic. Hence, it makes sense to ask how many real zeros a random cosine polynomial (of degree n) with identically and normally distributed coefficients possesses if the coefficients are sorted in palindromic blocks of a fixed length ℓ In this paper, we show that the asymptotics of the expected number of real roots of such a polynomial is \({{\rm{K}}_\ell} \times 2n/\sqrt 3 \), where the constant Kℓ (depending only on ℓ) is greater than 1, and can be explicitly represented by a double integral formula.

In the present paper we give geometric criteria on a metric space under which we can find similar families of curves. We shall find these curves by first solving a “dual” problem of building Lipschitz maps from our metric space into a sphere with good topological properties.

We propose a Atangana–Baleanu type fractional-order model and simulate it by using predictor–corrector (P-C) method. First we introduce the biological nature of this virus in theoretical way and then formulate a mathematical model to define its dynamics. We use a well-known effective optimization scheme based on the renowned trust-region-reflective (TRR) method to perform the model calibration. We have plotted the real cases of COVID-19 and compared our integer-order model with the simulated data along with the calculation of basic reproductive number. Concerning fractional-order simulations, first we prove the existence and uniqueness of solution and then write the solution along with the stability of the given P-C method. A number of graphs at various fractional-order values are simulated to predict the future dynamics of the virus in Argentina which is the main contribution of this paper.","Pushpendra Kumar1, Vedat Suat Erturk2, Marina Murillo-Arcila

In the off-line setting, we discover several structural properties of the optimal sample path of such DESs. Using the structural properties, we also propose a greedy algorithm which is shown numerically near optimal. For on-line control, we design a Receding Horizon (RH) controller.

Its Lasserre relaxation of degree d is a certain natural linear matrix inequality in the original variables and one additional variable for each nonlinear monomial of degree at most d. It defines a spectrahedron that projects down to a convex semialgebraic set containing S. In the best case, the projection equals the convex hull of S. We show that this is very often the case for sufficiently high d if S is compact and “bulges outwards” on the boundary of its convex hull. Now let additionally a polynomial objective function f be given, i.e., consider a polynomial optimization problem. Its Lasserre relaxation of degree d is now a semidefinite program. In the best case, the optimal values of the polynomial optimization problem and its relaxation agree. We prove that this often happens if S is compact and d exceeds some bound that depends on the description of S and certain characteristics of f like the mutual distance of its global minimizers on S.",Tom-Lukas Kriel1 & Markus Schweighofer,Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-018-9406-z,"Moment relaxation,Lasserre relaxation,Pure state,Basic closed semialgebraic set,Positive polynomial,Sum of squares,Polynomial optimization,Semidefinite programming,Linear matrix inequality,Spectrahedron,Semidefinitely representable set"

81,Combinatorial Optimization in Real-Time Scheduling: Theory and Algorithms,"Real-time computer systems are essential for many applications, such as robot control, avionics, medical instrumentation, manufacturing, etc. The correctness of the system depends on the temporal correctness as well as the functional correctness of the task executions. In order to assure temporal correctness it is necessary that the resources be scheduled to meet the temporal requirements of applications. When we consider the problem of nonpreemptive scheduling of a set of tasks in a processor for which no feasible solution exists, some tasks may have to be rejected so that a schedule can be generated for the rest. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating an optimal schedule such that the number of rejected tasks is minimized, and then the finish time is minimized for the accepted tasks. We propose to use an analytic approach to solve this problem. We first discuss the super sequence based technique which was originally proposed for reducing the search space in testing the feasibility of a task set. Then we show by the Conformation theorem that the super sequence constructed from the task set also provides a valid and reduced search space for the optimization problem.

Aldous's Brownian continuum random tree, the random tree-like object naturally associated with a standard Brownian excursion, may be thought of as a random compact real tree. The continuum random tree is a scaling limit as N→∞ of both a critical Galton-Watson tree conditioned to have total population size N as well as a uniform random rooted combinatorial tree with N vertices. The Aldous–Broder algorithm is a Markov chain on the space of rooted combinatorial trees with N vertices that has the uniform tree as its stationary distribution. We construct and study a Markov process on the space of all rooted compact real trees that has the continuum random tree as its stationary distribution and arises as the scaling limit as N→∞ of the Aldous–Broder chain.

89,Classification of the Real Roots of the Quartic Equation and their Pythagorean Tunes,"Presented is a very detailed two-tier analysis of the location of the real roots of the general quartic equation \(x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0\) with real coefficients and the classification of the roots in terms of a, b, c, and d, without using any numerical approximations. Associated with the general quartic, there is a number of subsidiary quadratic equations (resolvent quadratic equations) whose roots allow this systematization as well as the determination of the bounds of the individual roots of the quartic. In many cases the root isolation intervals are found. The second tier of the analysis uses two subsidiary cubic equations (auxiliary cubic equations) and solving these, together with some of the resolvent quadratic equations, allows the full classification of the roots of the general quartic and also the determination of the isolation interval of each root. These isolation intervals involve the stationary points of the quartic (among others) and, by solving some of the resolvent quadratic equations, the isolation intervals of the stationary points of the quartic are also determined. The presented classification of the roots of the quartic equation is particularly useful in situations in which the equation stems from a model the coefficients of which are (functions of) the model parameters and solving cubic equations, let alone using the explicit quartic formulæ , is a daunting task. The only benefit in such cases would be to gain insight into the location of the roots and the proposed method provides this. Each possible case has been carefully studied and illustrated with a detailed figure containing a description of its specific characteristics, analysis based on solving cubic equations and analysis based on solving quadratic equations only. As the analysis of the roots of the quartic equation is done by studying the intersection points of the “sub-quartic” \(x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2\) with a set of suitable parallel lines, a beautiful Pythagorean analogy can be found between these intersection points and the set of parallel lines on one hand and the musical notes and the staves representing different musical pitches on the other: each particular case of the quartic equation has its own short tune.","Emil M.

90,Controller synthesis for dynamic hierarchical real-time plants using timed automata,"We use timed I/O automata based timed games to synthesize task-level reconfiguration services for cost-effective fault tolerance in a case study. The case study shows that state-space explosion is a severe problem for timed games. By applying suitable abstractions, we dramatically improve the scalability. However, timed I/O automata do not facilitate algorithmic abstraction generation techniques. The case study motivates the development of timed process automata to improve modeling and analysis for controller synthesis of time-critical plants which can be hierarchical and dynamic. The model offers two essential features for industrial systems: (i) compositional modeling with reusable designs for different contexts, and (ii) state-space reduction technique. Timed process automata model dynamic networks of continuous-time communicating plant processes which can activate other plant processes. We show how to establish safety and reachability properties of timed process automata by reduction to solving timed games. To mitigate the state-space explosion problem, an algorithmic state-space reduction technique using compositional reasoning and aggressive abstractions is also proposed. In this article, we demonstrate the theoretical framework of timed process automata and the effectiveness of the proposed state-space reduction technique by extending the case study.","Md Tawhid Bin Waez1, Andrzej Wąsowski2, Juergen Dingel3 & …Karen Rudie",Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10626-017-0240-2,"Timed automata,Controller synthesis,Timed I/O automata,Dynamic,Timed process automata,Hierarchical,Compositional,Reusable designs,State-space reduction technique"

96,Is Discontinuous Reconstruction Really a Good Idea?,"It has been almost automatically assumed for a quarter century that the numerical solution of hyperbolic conservation laws is best accomplished by making a reconstruction of the initial data that is only piecewise continuous. The effect of the discontinuities is taken into account by means of Riemann solvers. This strategy has enjoyed great practical success but introduces only one-dimensional physics as a guide to the discretization of multidimensional problems. This article points out some of the resulting defects and proposes an alternative viewpoint. The chief novelty of the new “Active Flux” method, apart from the elimination of discontinuities, is the division into advective and acoustic disturbances, with acoustics being handled by exploiting classical solutions to the scalar wave equation. Results for a standard test problem for the compressible Euler equations indicate that an order of magnitude increase in cost effectiveness may be possible by following this approach, compared to the traditional one.","Philip Roe

This generalizes a result of Szegő and answers, among other things, a long-standing question of Lewy and Askey concerning the positivity of Taylor coefficients for certain rational functions. Our proofs are based on two ab-initio methods for proving that \({P^{-\beta}}\) is completely monotone on a convex cone C: the determinantal method and the quadratic-form method. These methods are closely connected with harmonic analysis on Euclidean Jordan algebras (or equivalently on symmetric cones). We furthermore have a variety of constructions that, given such polynomials, can create other ones with the same property: among these are algebraic analogues of the matroid operations of deletion, contraction, direct sum, parallel connection, series connection and 2-sum. The complete monotonicity of \({P^{-\beta}}\) for some \({\beta > 0}\) can be viewed as a strong quantitative version of the half-plane property (Hurwitz stability) for P, and is also related to the Rayleigh property for matroids.","Alexander D.

99,A Transfer Principle for the Continuations of Real Functions to the Levi-Civita Field,"We discuss the properties of the continuations of real functions to the Levi-Civita field. In particular, we show that, whenever a function f is analytic on a compact interval [a, b] ⊂ ℝ, f and its analytic continuation f̅∞ satisfy the same properties that can be expressed in the language of real closed ordered fields. If f is not analytic, then this equivalence does not hold. These results suggest an analogy with the internal and external functions of nonstandard analysis: while the canonical continuations of analytic functions resemble internal functions, the continuations of non-analytic functions behave like external functions. Inspired by this analogy, we suggest some directions for further research.",Emanuele Bottazzi,"p-Adic Numbers, Ultrametric Analysis and Applications",2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S2070046618030032,"Levi-Civita field,non-Archimedean analysis,analytic continuation,transfer principle"

It is known that the total disconnectedness of F in the topology induced by the order makes the usual (topological) notions of continuity and differentiability too weak to extend real calculus results to F. In this paper, we introduce new stronger concepts of continuity and differentiability which we call derivate continuity and derivate differentiability [2, 12]; andwe show that derivate continuous and differentiable functions satisfy the usual addition, product and composition rules and that n-times derivate differentiable functions satisfy a Taylor formula with remainder similar to that of the real case. Then we generalize the definitions of derivate continuity and derivate differentiability to multivariable F-valued functions and we prove related results that are useful for doing analysis on F and F

However, these abstract spaces presuppose the real numbers. In this paper, we show how to set up an abstract type for the real numbers. The appropriateness of our construction works in tandem with the bounded functional interpretation.","Fernando Ferreira

Based on the work of Fokas (Comm Pure Appl Math 58(5):639–670, 2005), a kind of exact nonreflecting boundary conditions which are suitable for numerical purposes are presented with the inverse scattering theory. With these boundary conditions imposed on the artificially introduced boundary points, a reduced problem defined on a finite computational interval is formulated. The discretization of the nonreflecting boundary conditions is studied in detail, and a dual-Petrov–Galerkin spectral method is proposed for the numerical solution to the reduced problem. Some numerical tests are given, which validate the effectiveness, and suggest the stability of the proposed scheme.","Chunxiong Zheng1,",Numerische Mathematik,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-006-0044-z,"Soliton,mKdV Equation,Gaussian Wave Packet,Neumann Function,Nonreflecting Boundary Condition"
113,An elementary introduction to the construction and the analysis of perfectly matched layers for time domain wave propagation,"As soon as people have been interested in the numerical simulation of wave propagation phenomena, particularly in the time domain, they had to face the delicate question of realizing “transparent” artificial boundaries. Indeed, many problems of this type are posed in a unbounded domain (or in a domain which is very large with respect to a zone of interest in which one wishes to observe the solution): one thus has to bound artificially the computational domain in such a way that the non physical boundaries are “transparent” for the solution. Due to the crucial importance of this subject, but also because of its difficulty, this question has aroused the curiosity from many researchers, first from engineers, next from applied mathematicians. It would be much too ambitious to give a complete panorama of a research that began almost forty years ago (see however the article by T. Hagstrm [20] which constitutes a quite complete review of the domain) but one can now measure how much the many ingenious ideas proposed by the one or the others have permitted to accomplish impressive progress in this matter. Nowadays, if one restricts oneself to linear wave propagation problems, one can consider that, even though some questions remain open, satisfactory solutions are available for a large number of applications, in particular in the “canonical case” I will have in mind throughout this paper, namely the case where one wishes to reduce numerical computations to a convex bounded domain, assuming that the exterior domain is homogeneous and source free.Recently, in particular for the applications in acoustics and electromagnetism, important progress has been achieved in the use of “exact” boundary conditions associated to homogeneous exterior domains. One usually introduces a boundary operator called “Dirichlet to Neumann” (DtN) operator that can be represented by using separation of variables in the exterior domain (in 3D, one will use typically spherical harmonics [19], which requires a spherical artificial boundary) or through the coupling with an integral representation formula of the exterior solution (which relies on the explicit knowledge of the Green’s function of the problem) [4].",Patrick Joly,SeMA Journal,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03322599,"Wave Equation,Cauchy Problem,Hyperbolic System,Perfectly Match Layer,Unperturbed System"

We study the problem of when \(A \cdot \Omega \) is a (multiplicative) tiling of the real line, that is when almost every real number can be uniquely written as a product \(a\cdot \omega \), with \(a \in A\), \(\omega \in \Omega \). We study both the structure of the set of multiples A and the structure of the tile \(\Omega \). We prove strong results in both cases. These results are somewhat analogous to the known results about the structure of translational tiling of the real line. There is, however, an extra layer of complexity due to the presence of sign in the sets A and \(\Omega \), which makes multiplicative tiling roughly equivalent to translational tiling on the larger group \(\mathbb {Z}_2 \times \mathbb {R}\).",Mihail N.

118,Probability in 1919/20: the von Mises-Pólya-Controversy,"The correspondence between Richard von Mises and George Pólya of 1919/20 contains reflections on two well-known articles by von Mises on the foundations of probability in the Mathematische Zeitschrift of 1919, and one paper from the Physikalische Zeitschrift of 1918. The topics touched on in the correspondence are: the proof of the central limit theorem of probability theory, von Mises' notion of randomness, and a statistical criterion for integer-valuedness of physical data. The investigation will hint at both the fruitfulness and the limits of several of von Mises' notions such as ``collective'', ``distribution'' and ``complex adjuncts'' (characteristic functions) for further developments in probability theory and in ``directional statistics''. By pointing to the selectiveness of Pólya's criticism, the historical analysis shows the differing expectations of the two men with respect to the further development of the theory of probability and its applications. The paper thus gives a glimpse of the provisional state of the theory around 1920, before others such as P. Lévy (1886–1971) and A. N.

First, a regulating system is considered; we investigate the design of the controller for simultaneous reduction of error and error derivative to zero. It is seen that this can be achieved provided the initial values of error and error derivative fall inside an admissible (or controllable) region. Attention is then focused on the tracking system. It is shown that, provided the input to the system is of a form similar to the impulse response of the plant, and provided the initial values of error and error derivative of the system fall inside the same admissible region, then the controller used for regulating the system can also be used for tracking the system so as to force the output of the plant to follow the input perfectly; in both cases with at mostone switching reversal of the relay.",I.

It has been shown that the off-line version of this problem can be efficiently solved by the Critical Task Decomposition Algorithm (CTDA) (Mao et al., IEEE Trans Mobile Comput 6(6):678–688, 2007). In the on-line version, random task characteristics (e.g., arrival times) are not known in advance. To bypass this difficulty, worst-case analysis may be used. This, however, does not make use of probability distributions and results in an overly conservative solution. In this paper, we develop a new approach which does not rely on worst-case analysis but provides a “best solution in probability” efficiently obtained by estimating the probability distribution of sample-path-optimal solutions. We introduce a condition termed “non-singularity” under which the best solution in probability leads to the on-line optimal control. Numerical examples are included to illustrate our results and show substantial performance improvements over worst-case analysis.",Jianfeng Mao1 & Christos G.

128,Interval Methods for Real-Time Capable Robust Control of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,"Reliable control strategies for complex dynamic systems have to account for stability and robustness despite the presence of both parameter uncertainty and measurement errors. In addition, such control strategies have to comply with performance specifications that can be described either by the minimization of suitable cost functions or by direct specifications of desired reference trajectories. To handle bounded uncertainty and errors in a reliable way, it is possible to include the use of interval analysis in real-time control environments. Previous work has shown that approaches based on the general methodology of sliding mode and predictive control are promising options in this context. This paper presents a comparison of the properties of interval extensions of both types of control procedures for the thermal subsystem of a high-temperature solid oxide fuel cell. Representative simulation results conclude this contribution.","Andreas Rauh1, Luise Senkel1, Ekaterina Auer2 & …Harald Aschemann",Mathematics in Computer Science,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11786-014-0205-x,"Interval analysis,Sliding mode control,Predictive control,Sensitivity analysis,Temperature control of solid oxide fuel cells"
129,Locally convex topologies and control theory,"Using recent characterisations of topologies of spaces of vector fields for general regularity classes—e.g., Lipschitz, finitely differentiable, smooth, and real analytic—characterisations are provided of geometric control systems that utilise these topologies. These characterisations can be expressed as joint regularity properties of the system as a function of state and control. It is shown that the common characterisations of control systems in terms of their joint dependence on state and control are, in fact, representations of the fact that the natural mapping from the control set to the space of vector fields is continuous. The classes of control systems defined are new, even in the smooth category. However, in the real analytic category, the class of systems defined is new and deep. What are called “real analytic control systems” in this article incorporate the real analytic topology in a way that has hitherto been unexplored. Using this structure, it is proved, for example, that the trajectories of a real analytic control system corresponding to a fixed open-loop control depend on initial condition in a real analytic manner. It is also proved that control-affine systems always have the appropriate joint dependence on state and control. This shows, for example, that the trajectories of a control-affine system corresponding to a fixed open-loop control depend on initial condition in the manner prescribed by the regularity of the vector fields.",Saber Jafarpour1 & Andrew D.

131,"The foundational aspects of Gauss’s work on the hypergeometric, factorial and digamma functions","In his writings about hypergeometric functions Gauss succeeded in moving beyond the restricted domain of eighteenth-century functions by changing several basic notions of analysis. He rejected formal methodology and the traditional notions of functions, complex numbers, infinite numbers, integration, and the sum of a series. Indeed, he thought that analysis derived from a few, intuitively given notions by means of other well-defined concepts which were reducible to intuitive ones. Gauss considered functions to be relations between continuous variable quantities while he regarded integration and summation as appropriate operations with limits. He also regarded infinite and infinitesimal numbers as a façon de parler and used inequalities in order to prove the existence of certain limits. He took complex numbers to have the same legitimacy as real quantities. However, Gauss’s continuum was linked to a revised form of the eighteenth-century notion of continuous quantity: it was not reducible to a set of numbers but was immediately given.",Giovanni Ferraro,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-007-0004-8,"Elementary Function,Eighteenth Century,Hypergeometric Function,Factorial Function,Hypergeometric Series"

135,Microlocal analysis of asymptotically hyperbolic and Kerr-de Sitter spaces (with an appendix by Semyon Dyatlov),"In this paper we develop a general, systematic, microlocal framework for the Fredholm analysis of non-elliptic problems, including high energy (or semiclassical) estimates, which is stable under perturbations. This framework, described in Sect. 2, resides on a compact manifold without boundary, hence in the standard setting of microlocal analysis.Many natural applications arise in the setting of non-Riemannian b-metrics in the context of Melrose’s b-structures. These include asymptotically de Sitter-type metrics on a blow-up of the natural compactification, Kerr-de Sitter-type metrics, as well as asymptotically Minkowski metrics.The simplest application is a new approach to analysis on Riemannian or Lorentzian (or indeed, possibly of other signature) conformally compact spaces (such as asymptotically hyperbolic or de Sitter spaces), including a new construction of the meromorphic extension of the resolvent of the Laplacian in the Riemannian case, as well as high energy estimates for the spectral parameter in strips of the complex plane. These results are also available in a follow-up paper which is more expository in nature (Vasy in Uhlmann, G. (ed.) Inverse Problems and Applications. Inside Out II, 2012).The appendix written by Dyatlov relates his analysis of resonances on exact Kerr-de Sitter space (which then was used to analyze the wave equation in that setting) to the more general method described here.",András Vasy,Inventiones mathematicae,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-012-0446-8,"35L05,35P25,58J47,83C57"

For certain parameter values, the solution has a ‘wave-like’ profile, which appears in the distribution of osteogenic cells, osteoblasts, growth factor and bone matrix. This ‘wave-like’ profile contradicts experimental observations. In our study we investigate the conditions, under which such profile appears in the solution. Those conditions are determined in terms of model parameters, by means of linear stability analysis, carried out at one of the constant solutions of the simplified system. The stability analysis was carried out for the reduced system of PDE’s, of which we prove, that it is equivalent to the original system of equations, with respect to the stability properties of constant solutions. The conclusions, derived from the linear stability analysis, are extended for the case of large perturbations. If the constant solution is unstable, then the solution of the system never converges to this constant solution. The analytical results are validated with finite element simulations. The simulations show, that stability of the constant solution could determine the behavior of the solution of the whole system, if certain initial conditions are considered.",Pavel Prokharau1 & Fred Vermolen,Journal of Mathematical Biology,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-012-0513-1,"Bone-implant ingrowth,Pattern formation,Constant solutions,Linear stability,Finite element simulations"
137,Referential Opacity and Epistemic Logic,"Referential opacity is the failure of substitutivity of identity (SI, for short) and in Quine’s view of existential generalization (EG, for short) as well. Quine thinks that its “solution” in epistemic and doxastic contexts, which relies on the notion of exportation, leads to undesirable results. But epistemic logicians such as Jaakko Hintikka and Wolfgang Lenzen provide another solution based on a different diagnosis: opacity is not, as in Quine’s view, due to the absence of reference, it is rather due to the plurality of references; therefore, one must stabilize the reference to restore SI and EG. However, Hintikka’s semantics remains classical in its treatment of existence, which makes EG non-applicable to possible objects, while in Lenzen’s system, EG is applicable by means of a particular quantifier. But this requires adding the predicate of existence to account for real objects. In this paper, I will show the advantages and disadvantages of both solutions and will end by providing an alternative approach to the problem of non-existent objects, which stays into the frame of possible worlds semantics, but introduces some more restrictions, eliminates the problematic predicate of existence, and applies a neutral quantifier to possible non-existent objects.",Saloua Chatti,Logica Universalis,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11787-011-0034-5,Primary 03B42

)−1 as an operator on spaces of weighted continuous functions. Numerical solution by a simple discrete collocation method on a uniform grid on ℝ is then analysed: in the case whenz is compactly supported this leads to a coefficient matrix which allows a rapid matrix-vector multiply via the FFT. To utilise this possibility we propose a modified two-grid iteration, a feature of which is that the coarse grid matrix is approximated by a banded matrix, and analyse convergence and computational cost. In cases wherez is not compactly supported a combined finite section and two-grid algorithm can be applied and we extend the analysis to this case. As an application we consider acoustic scattering in the half-plane with a Robin or impedance boundary condition which we formulate as a boundary integral equation of the class studied.

To minimize the steady-state probability of loss with respect to the load-sharing parameters, we propose to use the likelihood ratio derivative estimate approach, which has recently been studied for sensitivity analysis of stochastic systems. We formulate a recursive stochastic optimization algorithm using likelihood ratio estimates to solve the optimization problem and provide a proof for almost sure convergence of the algorithm.

Performance in such systems is measured by the probability a customer is lost. For a system ofK parallel servers with a probabilistic routing and admission control scheme, the problem of the optimal routing and admission control is considered and two approaches are presented. Assuming the availability of a closed-form expression for the probability of loss at each server, the problem is solved under general conditions and properties of the optimal flow allocation are given. However, such closed-form expressions are often unavailable. This motivates a second approach, which involves a gradient-based stochastic optimization algorithm with on-line gradient estimation. The gradient estimation problem for loss probabilities is solved through a recently-developed smoothed perturbation analysis (SPA) technique. The effectiveness of on-line stochastic optimization using this type of gradient estimator is demonstrated by combining the SPA algorithm with a sampling-controlled stochastic optimization algorithm for the aforementioned routing and admission control problem.",M.

150,Distribution of Eigenvalues of Real Symmetric Palindromic Toeplitz Matrices and Circulant Matrices,"
Consider the ensemble of real symmetric Toeplitz matrices, each independent entry an i.i.d. random variable chosen from a fixed probability distribution p of mean 0, variance 1, and finite higher moments. Previous investigations showed that the limiting spectral measure (the density of normalized eigenvalues) converges weakly and almost surely, independent of p, to a distribution which is almost the standard Gaussian. The deviations from Gaussian behavior can be interpreted as arising from obstructions to solutions of Diophantine equations. We show that these obstructions vanish if instead one considers real symmetric palindromic Toeplitz matrices, matrices where the first row is a palindrome. A similar result was previously proved for a related circulant ensemble through an analysis of the explicit formulas for eigenvalues. By Cauchy’s interlacing property and the rank inequality, this ensemble has the same limiting spectral distribution as the palindromic Toeplitz matrices; a consequence of combining the two approaches is a version of the almost sure Central Limit Theorem. Thus our analysis of these Diophantine equations provides an alternate technique for proving limiting spectral measures for certain ensembles of circulant matrices.

Real-time control approximations of the perturbedoptimal solutions are obtained by evaluating first-order Taylor expansionsof the optimal solutions with respect to the parameter. The proposednumerical methods are applied to the industrial robot Manutec r3. Thequality of the real-time approximations is illustrated for perturbations inthe transport load.",C. Boskens1 & H.

155,On the Usage of Different Coordinate Systems for 3D Plots of Functions of Two Real Variables,"Students learning towards a degree in a STEM related domain learn quite early a course in Advanced Calculus, i.e. a course where the main object of study are multivariate functions. It happens that students do not see the connection between the properties of the function such as continuity or differentiability and the 3-dimensional graphical representation. In particular, difficulties appear in classroom for functions having different limits at a point, according to the path approaching the point. One of the ways for this analysis is to use different coordinate systems to study the behavior of the function. Constraints exist on the hardware, the software and on the numerical approximation methods, which may lead to completely different graphs for the same function, when using two different coordinate systems. In this contribution we analyze the different types of graphs created with a CAS such as MATLAB 14 and Maple 2017 for different coordinate systems, in terms of properties of the 2-variable function under study. We prove that when the function is continuous, the 3D graphical representation does not depend on the coordinate system in use. However, when the function is discontinuous,the graphical representation depends strongly on the coordinate system and on the type of discontinuity (point singularity, line singularity, multiple singularity, etc.). Moreover, without a suitable analysis prior to plotting, the 3D graph may be uncorrect. The software shows a strange behavior around the singular points. It happens also that a line singularity is replaced either by a point singularity or by no singularity. We analyse the software behavior using numerical analysis of the meshing algorithm.",David G.

156,Estimates for maximal functions associated with hypersurfaces in ℝ3 and related problems of harmonic analysis,"We study the boundedness problem for maximal operators \( \mathcal{M} \) associated with averages along smooth hypersurfaces S of finite type in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. For p > 2, we prove that if no affine tangent plane to S passes through the origin and S is analytic, then the associated maximal operator is bounded on \( {L^p}\left( {{\mathbb{R}^3}} \right) \) if and only if p > h(S), where h(S) denotes the so-called height of the surface S (defined in terms of certain Newton diagrams). For non-analytic S we obtain the same statement with the exception of the exponent p = h(S). Our notion of height h(S) is closely related to A. N. Varchenko’s notion of height h(ϕ) for functions ϕ such that S can be locally represented as the graph of ϕ after a rotation of coordinates.Several consequences of this result are discussed. In particular we verify a conjecture by E. M. Stein and its generalization by A. Iosevich and E. Sawyer on the connection between the decay rate of the Fourier transform of the surface measure on S and the L
p-boundedness of the associated maximal operator \( \mathcal{M} \), and a conjecture by Iosevich and Sawyer which relates the L
p-boundedness of \( \mathcal{M} \) to an integrability condition on S for the distance to tangential hyperplanes, in dimension 3.In particular, we also give essentially sharp uniform estimates for the Fourier transform of the surface measure on S, thus extending a result by V. N. Karpushkin from the analytic to the smooth setting and implicitly verifying a conjecture by V. I. Arnold in our context. As an immediate application of this, we obtain an \( {L^p}\left( {{\mathbb{R}^3}} \right) - {L^2}(S) \) Fourier restriction theorem for S.","Isroil A.

157,Admissible Transformations and Normalized Classes of Nonlinear Schrödinger Equations,"The theory of group classification of differential equations is analyzed, substantially extended and enhanced based on the new notions of conditional equivalence group and normalized class of differential equations. Effective new techniques are proposed. Using these, we exhaustively describe admissible point transformations in classes of nonlinear (1+1)-dimensional Schrödinger equations, in particular, in the class of nonlinear (1+1)-dimensional Schrödinger equations with modular nonlinearities and potentials and some subclasses thereof. We then carry out a complete group classification in this class, representing it as a union of disjoint normalized subclasses and applying a combination of algebraic and compatibility methods. Moreover, we introduce the complete classification of (1+2)-dimensional cubic Schrödinger equations with potentials. The proposed approach can be applied to studying symmetry properties of a wide range of differential equations.","Roman O.

158,Isomorphisms and non-isomorphisms of at actions,"Measure-theoretic classification of ergodic actions of the integers and reals was developed through the use of von Neumann algebras by Krieger and later by Connes and Woods. In particular, the latter showed that AT (approximatively transitive) actions are classified by their Poisson boundary obtained from an inverse limit of (binomial) polynomials. Recently (2008), Giordano and Handelman [GH] showed that the classification can be divorced from the von Neumann algebra and inverse limit constructions, by instead examining (what amounts to the predual) direct limits. This results in a measure-theoretic version of dimension groups (used in C*-algebras, especially in classification programmes), and a corresponding equivalence relation on diagrams which amounts to determining isomorphism classes. The next step is to translate the equivalence relation to easily (or relatively easily) computable criteria, usually numerical, and this is the thrust of this paper. An ergodic action whose corresponding factor is said to have pure point spectrum if it is isomorphic to its tensor square, or equivalently, the ergodic action satisfies the analogous property. Giordano and Skandalis obtained a numerical sufficient condition in [GS]. Here expressed in terms of a direct limit of either binomial or truncated Poisson distributions (actually more general distributions, using variance), we obtain numerical conditions that are an improvement on those of [GS] in the cases in which the latter apply, and extend them to a much wider class, called relatively absorbing. Some surprises occur, particularly when the gaps in the corresponding random walk increase unboundedly. We also deal with invariants for isomorphism in the measure-theoretic dimension group setting. An old one, developed in [CW], is the T-set. We extend the idea to create new invariants that are effective when the T-set is not; again, these involve numerical data (involving computations of \( l^{\underset{\raise0.3em\hbox{$\smash{\scriptscriptstyle-}$}}{1} } \), that is, total variation, distances) that are fairly tractible. We also give effective criteria for the T-set to be trivial modulo roots of unity.",David Handelman,Journal d'Analyse Mathématique,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11854-009-0026-z,"Unit Circle,Entire Function,Positive Real Number,Maclaurin Series,Poisson Boundary"
159,Evolution Equations for Special Lagrangian 3-Folds in C3,"This is the third in a series of papers constructing explicit examples of special Lagrangian submanifolds in Cm. The previous paper (Math. Ann.

t
: Rn→ Cm, satisfying a first-order o.d.e. in t. In this paper we use the same idea to construct special Lagrangian 3-folds in C3. We find a one-to-one correspondence between sets of evolution data with m = 3 and homogeneous symplectic 2-manifolds P. This enables us to write down several interesting sets of evolution data, and so to construct corresponding families of special Lagrangian 3-folds in C3.Our main results are a number of new families of special Lagrangian 3-foldsin C3, which we write very explicitly in parametric form. Generically these are nonsingular as immersed 3-submanifolds, and diffeomorphic to R3 or

161,Operational semantics of a domain specific language for real time musician–computer interaction,"With the advent and availability of powerful personal computing, the computer music research and industry have been focusing on real-time musical interactions between musicians and computers; delegating human-like actions to computers who interact with a musical environment. One common use-case of this kind is Automatic Accompaniment where the system is comprised of a real-time machine listening system that in reaction to recognition of events in a score from a human performer, launches necessary actions for the accompaniment section. While the real-time detection of score events out of live musicians’ performance has been widely addressed in the literature, score accompaniment (or the reactive part of the process) has been rarely discussed. This paper deals with this missing component in the literature from a formal language perspective. We show how language considerations would enable better authoring of time and interaction during programming/composing and how it addresses critical aspects of a musical performance (such as errors) in real-time. We sketch the real-time features required by automatic musical accompaniment seen as a reactive system. We formalize the timing strategies for musical events taking into account the various temporal scales used in music. Various strategies for the handling of synchronization constraints and the handling of errors are presented. We give a formal semantics to model the possible behaviors of the system in terms of Parametric Timed Automata.","José Echeveste1, Arshia Cont1, Jean-Louis Giavitto1 & …Florent Jacquemard",Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10626-013-0166-2,"Computer music,Score following,Automatic musical accompaniment,Synchronous programming ,Synchronous language,Error handling"

Based on an efficient weak generic position-checking method and a method for solving bivariate polynomial systems, the authors give a first deterministic and efficient algorithm to compute the topology of an algebraic space curve. Compared to extant methods, the new algorithm is efficient for two reasons. The bit size of the coefficients appearing in the sheared polynomials are greatly improved. The other is that one projection is enough for most general cases in the new algorithm. After the topology of an algebraic space curve is given, the authors also provide an isotopic-meshing (approximation) of the space curve. Moreover, an approximation of the algebraic space curve can be generated automatically if the approximations of two projected plane curves are first computed. This is also an advantage of our method. Many non-trivial experiments show the efficiency of the algorithm.",Kai Jin1 & Jinsan Cheng,Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-020-8378-7,"Algebraic space curve,topology,weak generic position"

In this work, a particle swarm inspired multi-elitist ABC algorithm named PS-MEABC is proposed and applied for real-parameter optimization. In this modified version, the global best solution and an elitist randomly selected from the elitist archive are used to modify parameters of each food source in either onlooker bees or employed bees phases. PS-MEABC is compared with 5 state-of-the-art swarm based algorithms on CEC05 and BBOB12 benchmark functions in terms of four metrics: the mean error, the best error, the success rate (SR) and the expected running time (ERT). Wilcoxon signed ranks test results on the mean and the best error show that the performance of PS-MEABC is significantly better than or at least similar to these algorithms, and PS-MEABC has wider application range in terms of the success rate and faster convergence speed in terms of the expected running time. Our algorithm is comparable to its competitors with a fewer control parameters to be tuned.","Yi Xiang1, Yuming Peng1, Yubin Zhong2, Zhenyu Chen1, Xuwen Lu1 & …Xuejun Zhong",Computational Optimization and Applications,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10589-013-9591-2,"Artificial bee colony algorithm,Multi-elitist preservation strategy,PSO algorithm,Wilcoxon signed ranks test"

But γ-convex functions possess so-called conservation properties, meaning good properties which remain true on every bounded interval or even on the entire domain, if only they hold true on an arbitrary closed interval with length γ. It is shown that boundedness, bounded variation, integrability, continuity, and differentiability almost everywhere are conservation properties of γ-convex functions on the real line. However, γ-convex functions have also infection properties, meaning bad properties which propagate to other points, once they appear somewhere (for example, discontinuity).

170,A theory of regularity structures,"We introduce a new notion of “regularity structure” that provides an algebraic framework allowing to describe functions and/or distributions via a kind of “jet” or local Taylor expansion around each point. The main novel idea is to replace the classical polynomial model which is suitable for describing smooth functions by arbitrary models that are purpose-built for the problem at hand. In particular, this allows to describe the local behaviour not only of functions but also of large classes of distributions. We then build a calculus allowing to perform the various operations (multiplication, composition with smooth functions, integration against singular kernels) necessary to formulate fixed point equations for a very large class of semilinear PDEs driven by some very singular (typically random) input. This allows, for the first time, to give a mathematically rigorous meaning to many interesting stochastic PDEs arising in physics. The theory comes with convergence results that allow to interpret the solutions obtained in this way as limits of classical solutions to regularised problems, possibly modified by the addition of diverging counterterms. These counterterms arise naturally through the action of a “renormalisation group” which is defined canonically in terms of the regularity structure associated to the given class of PDEs. Our theory also allows to easily recover many existing results on singular stochastic PDEs (KPZ equation, stochastic quantisation equations, Burgers-type equations) and to understand them as particular instances of a unified framework. One surprising insight is that in all of these instances local solutions are actually “smooth” in the sense that they can be approximated locally to arbitrarily high degree as linear combinations of a fixed family of random functions/distributions that play the role of “polynomials” in the theory. As an example of a novel application, we solve the long-standing problem of building a natural Markov process that is symmetric with respect to the (finite volume) measure describing the \(\Phi ^4_3\) Euclidean quantum field theory. It is natural to conjecture that the Markov process built in this way describes the Glauber dynamic of \(3\)-dimensional ferromagnets near their critical temperature.",M.

Singular integrals (part I).


3.
Hp, BMO, and singular integrals (part II).


4.

Harmonic analysis on groups.


6.
Wavelets.


I emphasized interconnections, both the way in which the material in the first lecture provided the roots out of which most of the developments in the other lectures grew, and the ways in which those developments interacted with each other. I included sketches of as many proofs as the time would permit: some very brief, but some fairly complete, especially those whose methodology is an important part of the subject. Much was omitted, of course, and there was a natural bias toward the areas where I have spent periods of my own mathematical life. Many developments, particularly those of the final quarter-century, received at most a brief mention.This paper is a written account of these lectures with a few more details fleshed out, a few topics reorganized, and a few items added. I hope that others may find it an interesting narrative and a useful reference, and that it may lead some of them to share my enjoyment of exploring the original sources. I have tried to provide the references to those sources wherever possible, and for the more recent developments I also provide references to various expository works as the occasion arises.

It is shown that the latter can be applied under more relaxed conditions than the former. We further analyze properties of the latter algorithm when applied as a preconditioner for Krylov subspace methods. Similar to the analysis of the inexact block LU preconditioner, we also analyze the properties of a fill-controlled incomplete LU preconditioner.

175,On the Topology and Isotopic Meshing of Plane Algebraic Curves,"This paper presents a symbolic algorithm to compute the topology of a plane curve. This is a full version of the authors' CASC15 paper. The algorithm mainly involves resultant computations and real root isolation for univariate polynomials. Compared to other symbolic methods based on elimination techniques, the novelty of the proposed method is that the authors use a technique of interval polynomials to solve the system \(\left\{ {f(\alpha ,y),\tfrac{{\partial f}}{{\partial y}}(\alpha ,y)} \right\}\) and simultaneously obtain numerous simple roots of f(α, y) = 0 on the α fiber. This significantly improves the efficiency of the lifting step because the authors are no longer required to compute the simple roots of f(α, y) = 0. After the topology is computed, a revised Newton's method is presented to compute an isotopic meshing of the plane algebraic curve. Though the approximation method is numerical, the authors can ensure that the proposed method is a certified one, and the meshing is topologically correct. Several nontrivial examples confirm that the proposed algorithm performs well.",Kai Jin1 & Jinsan Cheng,Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-020-8262-5,"Interval polynomial,isotopic meshing,plane curve,topology"
176,Geometry and analysis in Euler’s integral calculus,"Euler developed a program which aimed to transform analysis into an autonomous discipline and reorganize the whole of mathematics around it. The implementation of this program presented many difficulties, and the result was not entirely satisfactory. Many of these difficulties concerned the integral calculus. In this paper, we deal with some topics relevant to understand Euler’s conception of analysis and how he developed and implemented his program. In particular, we examine Euler’s contribution to the construction of differential equations and his notion of indefinite integrals and general integrals. We also deal with two remarkable difficulties of Euler’s program. The first concerns singular integrals, which were considered as paradoxical by Euler since they seemed to violate the generality of certain results. The second regards the explicitly use of the geometric representation and meaning of definite integrals, which was gone against his program. We clarify the nature of these difficulties and show that Euler never thought that they undermined his conception of mathematics and that a different foundation was necessary for analysis.","Giovanni Capobianco1, Maria Rosaria Enea2 & Giovanni Ferraro",Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-016-0179-y,"Elementary Function,Singular Integral,Differential Calculus,Transcendental Function,Geometric Problem"
177,"The original motivation for Copernicus’s research: Albert of Brudzewo’s Commentariolum super Theoricas novas Georgii Purbachii
","In 1454 Georg Peurbach taught astronomy at the Collegium Civium in Vienna by reading a work of his own: the Theoricae novae planetarum. In 1483 Albert of Brudzewo, teaching astronomy at Cracow University, adopted Peurbach’s text together with a commentariolum of his own. Among the numerous commentaries preserved both in manuscript and in printed form, Brudzewo’s stands out because it submits Peurbach’s work to a subtle analysis that, while recognising the merits for which it was widely accepted, also focuses on the limitations of the celestial spheres described in it. Budzewo’s commentary is of interest, in itself both for its criticism of Peurbach’s descriptions of solar, lunar and planetary theory and also for its importance to Copernicus’s own planetary theory. For Copernicus makes clear in the Commentariolus that his concern was the very same issue, violation of uniform circular motion by the rotation of spheres, that Brudzewo criticises in detail. In this way, Brudzewo’s commentary stands as the original motivation for the investigation of the motion of the planets that was eventually to lead Copernicus to a planetary theory based strictly upon uniform rotation of spheres, and through that investigation to the motion of the Earth and the heliocentric theory.",Michela Malpangotto,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-015-0171-y,"Apparent Motion,Celestial Body,Real Motion,Uniform Motion,Absolute Sense"

We show that the topology of such degenerations can be explicitly described via the Kato–Nakayama space of the central fibre as a log space. We furthermore provide generalities of real structures in log geometry and their lift to Kato–Nakayama spaces. A key point of this paper is a description of the Kato–Nakayama space of a toric degeneration and its real locus, both as bundles determined by tropical data.

183,A Real-Valued Measure on non-Archimedean Field Extensions of \(\mathbb{R}\),"Abstract We introduce a real-valued measure \( m _L \) on non-Archimedean ordered fields \(( \mathbb{F} ,<)\) that extend the field of real numbers \(({\mathbb R},<)\). 	The definition of \( m _L \) is inspired by the Loeb measures of hyperreal fields in the framework of Robinson’s analysis with infinitesimals. 	The real-valued measure \( m _L \) turns out to be general enough to obtain a canonical measurable representative in \( \mathbb{F} \) for every Lebesgue measurable subset of \({\mathbb R}\), moreover the measure of the two sets is equal. In addition, \(m_L\) it is more expressive than a class of non-Archimedean uniform measures. 	We focus on the properties of the real-valued measure in the case where \( \mathbb{F} = \mathcal{R} \), the Levi-Civita field. 	In particular, we compare \( m _L \) with the uniform non-Archimedean measure over \( \mathcal{R} \) developed by Shamseddine and Berz, and we prove that the first is infinitesimally close to the second, whenever the latter is defined. 	We also define a real-valued integral for functions on the Levi-Civita field, and we prove that every real continuous function has an integrable representative in \( \mathcal{R} \). 	Recall that this result is false for the current non-Archimedean integration over \( \mathcal{R} \). 	The paper concludes with a discussion on the representation of the Dirac distribution by pointwise functions on non-Archimedean domains.

184,"A Principled, Complete, and Efficient Representation of C++","We present a systematic representation of C++, called IPR, for complete semantic analysis and semantics-based program transformations. We describe the ideas and design principles that shaped the IPR. In particular, we describe how general type-based unification is key to minimal compact representation, fast type-safe traversal, and scalability. For example, the representation of a fairly typical non-trivial C++ program in GCC 3.4.2 was 32 times larger than its IPR representation; this led to significant improvements to GCC. IPR is general enough to handle real-world programs involving many translation units, archaic programming styles, and generic programming using C++0x extensions that affect the type system. The difficult issue of how to represent irregular (ad hoc) features in a systematic (non-ad hoc) manner is among the key contributions of this paper. The IPR data structure can represent all of C++ with just 157 simple node types; to compare the ISO C++ grammar has over 700 productions. The IPR is used for a variety of program analysis and transformation tasks, such as visualization, loop simplification, and concept extraction.

We also compute the stable ranks of the convolution algebras \({\ell^1(\mathbb {N}^n)}\) , \({\ell^1(\mathbb {Z}^n)}\) , ℓ1(S) and \({\ell^1(S\cap\mathbb {R}_+)}\) , where S is an arbitrary subgroup of \({\mathbb {R}}\) , of the almost periodic algebra AP and of \({{{\rm AP} \cap H^{\infty}}}\) , etc. We answer affirmatively the question posed by Mortini (Studia Mathematica 103(3):275–281, 1992). For the above algebras, the polydisc algebra \({A(\mathbb {D}^n)}\) , the algebra \({C(\mathbb T^n)}\) of continuous functions, and others, we also study their subsets (real Banach algebras) of real-valued measures, real-valued sequences or real-symmetric functions, and of corresponding exponentially stable algebras (for example, the Callier–Desoer algebra of causal exponentially decaying measures and L1 functions), and we compute their stable ranks. Finally, we show that in some of these real algebras a variant of the parity interlacing property is equivalent to reducibility of a unimodular (or coprime) pair. Also corona theorems are presented and the existence of coprime fractions is studied; in particular, we list which of these algebras are Bézout domains.",Kalle Mikkola1 & Amol Sasane,Complex Analysis and Operator Theory,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11785-009-0009-1,"Bass stable range,Topological stable rank,Parity interlacing property,Discrete measures,Commensurate delays,Almost periodic functions,Absolutely summable sequences,Real-valued functions,Real-symmetric functions,Callier–Desoer algebra,Polydisc algebra"

187,Improving crossover operator for real-coded genetic algorithms using virtual parents,"
The crossover operator is the most innovative and relevant operator in real-coded genetic algorithms. In this work we propose a new strategy to improve the performance of this operator by the creation of virtual parents obtained from the population parameters of localisation and dispersion of the best individuals. The idea consists of mating these virtual parents with individuals of the population. In this way, the offspring are created in the most promising regions. This strategy has been incorporated into several crossover operators. After analysing the results we can conclude that this strategy significantly improves the performance of the algorithm in most problems analysed.

The method is based on the following: 1) approximating the attainability sets with a family of hyperplanes; 2) subdividing the whole computational process into the computations performed beforehand and those that are carried out while the control takes place; 3) integrating the differential equations only over the displacement intervals of the final time point and the switching time points. The computational cost of the method is evaluated. The peculiarities of calculating the optimal control of a linear system with retarded control in real time are considered.

The topology is of prime interest but geometric information, such as the position of singular and critical points, is also relevant. A challenge is to compute efficiently this information for the given coordinate system even if the curve is not in generic position. Previous methods based on the cylindrical algebraic decomposition use sub-resultant sequences and computations with polynomials with algebraic coefficients. A novelty of our approach is to replace these tools by Gröbner basis computations and isolation with rational univariate representations. This has the advantage of avoiding computations with polynomials with algebraic coefficients, even in non-generic positions. Our algorithm isolates critical points in boxes and computes a decomposition of the plane by rectangular boxes. This decomposition also induces a new approach for computing an arrangement of polylines isotopic to the input curve. We also present an analysis of the complexity of our algorithm. An implementation of our algorithm demonstrates its efficiency, in particular on high-degree non-generic curves.","Jinsan Cheng1, Sylvain Lazard2, Luis Peñaranda2, Marc Pouget2, Fabrice Rouillier3,4 & …Elias Tsigaridas",Mathematics in Computer Science,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11786-010-0044-3,"Singular Point,Extreme Point,Algebraic Curf,Interval Arithmetic,Algebraic Computation"

Hence numerous algorithms have been devised in order to achieve this task. A lot of these algorithms are inexact in the sense that they allow perturbations to appear during the iterative process, and hence they enable one to better deal with noise and computational errors, as well as superiorization. For many years a certain fundamental question has remained open regarding many of these known inexact algorithmic schemes in various finite and infinite dimensional settings, namely whether there exist sequences satisfying these inexact schemes when errors appear. We provide a positive answer to this question. Our results also show that various theorems discussing the convergence of these inexact schemes have a genuine merit beyond the exact case. As a by-product we solve the standard and the strongly implicit inexact resolvent inclusion problems, introduce a promising class of functions (fully Legendre functions), establish continuous dependence (stability) properties of the solution of the inexact resolvent inclusion problem and continuity properties of the protoresolvent, and generalize the notion of strong monotonicity.",Daniel Reem1 & Simeon Reich,Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo Series 2,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12215-017-0318-6,"Algorithmic scheme,Fully Legendre function,Inexact,Inclusion,Maximally monotone operator,Protoresolvent,Resolvent,Well defined,Zero"

213,A real-world mine excavators timetabling methodology in open-pit mining,"In the literature of mining optimisation, most classical mine block sequencing or open-pit mine production scheduling problems are applied at strategic and tactical levels, because their objectives are to determine the optimal sequence of mineral blocks across a certain number of fixed time-length periods (measured in weeks, months or years) such that the total revenue is maximised. The application of continuous-time machine scheduling theory to mine equipment timetabling is challenging and rare in the current mining literature. In this study, inspired by microscopic scheduling requirements (measured in hours, minutes and seconds) in the iron ore open-pit mining industry, a new short-term Mine Excavators Timetabling (MET) problem is introduced and defined. The MET simultaneously assigns mine blocks to excavators and decides the sequencing of assigned blocks for each excavator so that the detailed scheduling of starting and completion time for excavation of each block is determined. Different from discrete periods in the classical mining optimisation problems, timing factors in the proposed MET are continuous and precise. The proposed MET aims at minimising the total weighted tardiness (delay cost) and the total weighted movement time (relocation cost) at the operational level. By analysing the key characteristics of excavating operations, the MET problem is transformed into a specific type of continuous-time machine scheduling problem, which is an innovative application to operational-level mining equipment management. Based on extensive computational experiments by mixed integer programming, a dominance-based constructive algorithm and a hybrid Tabu-Search Threshold-Accepting metaheuristic algorithm, theoretical insights and practical benefits are discussed in depth for real-world implementations. In comparison to the exact MIP solver (ILOG-CPLEX), computational experiments indicate that the proposed hybrid metaheuristic can obtain the same optimal solutions of small-size instances but with over 240 times less computational time. For solving medium-size instances, the proposed hybrid metaheuristic also outperforms ILOG-CPLEX in both solution quality and computational times (10.94 times better solution with 38.36 times less computational time on average). A sensitivity analysis under different scenarios is conducted to determine the saturation number of excavators with the best cost-effectiveness ratio in a demand-responsive scheduling horizon. The result analyses validate that the implementation of the optimised extraction timetable can significantly reduce the total relocation cost of excavators for large-size instances.","Shi Qiang Liu1, Erhan Kozan2, Paul Corry2, Mahmoud Masoud3 & …Kai Luo",Optimization and Engineering,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-022-09741-4,"Open-pit mining optimisation,Mine excavators timetabling,Machine scheduling theory,Mixed integer programming,Metaheuristics"
214,Goodness-of-Fit Tests and Nonparametric Adaptive Estimation for Spike Train Analysis,"When dealing with classical spike train analysis, the practitioner often performs goodness-of-fit tests to test whether the observed process is a Poisson process, for instance, or if it obeys another type of probabilistic model (Yana et al. in Biophys. J. 46(3):323–330, 1984; Brown et al. in Neural Comput. 14(2):325–346, 2002; Pouzat and Chaffiol in Technical report, http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:0909.2785, 2009). In doing so, there is a fundamental plug-in step, where the parameters of the supposed underlying model are estimated. The aim of this article is to show that plug-in has sometimes very undesirable effects. We propose a new method based on subsampling to deal with those plug-in issues in the case of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test of uniformity. The method relies on the plug-in of good estimates of the underlying model that have to be consistent with a controlled rate of convergence. Some nonparametric estimates satisfying those constraints in the Poisson or in the Hawkes framework are highlighted. Moreover, they share adaptive properties that are useful from a practical point of view. We show the performance of those methods on simulated data. We also provide a complete analysis with these tools on single unit activity recorded on a monkey during a sensory-motor task.Electronic Supplementary MaterialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/2190-8567-4-3) contains supplementary material.","Patricia Reynaud-Bouret1, Vincent Rivoirard2, Franck Grammont1 & …Christine Tuleau-Malot",The Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2190-8567-4-3,"Firing Rate,Poisson Process,Point Process,Spike Train,Interaction Function"

We present the Fermat topology, generated by a complete pseudo-metric, and the omega topology, generated by a complete metric. The first one is closely related to the differentiation of (non-standard) smooth functions defined on open sets of Fermat reals. The second one is connected to the differentiation of smooth functions defined on infinitesimal sets. Subsequently, we prove that every (proper) ideal is a set of infinitesimals whose order is less than or equal to some real number. Finally, we define and study roots of infinitesimals.

’s are linear forms in x, y, and z and λ is a real number. The coefficients of these linear forms, viewed as 3D vectors, are called multipole vectors of P. In this paper, we consider similar multipole representations of polynomial and analytic functions on other quadratic surfaces Q(x, y, z) =  c, real and complex. Over the complex numbers, the above representation is not unique, although the ambiguity is essentially finite. We investigate the combinatorics that depicts this ambiguity. We link these results with some classical theorems of harmonic analysis, theorems that describe decompositions of functions into sums of spherical harmonics. We extend these classical theorems (which rely on our understanding of the Laplace operator \(\Delta_{S^2}\)) to more general differential operators Δ

We study their intricate geometry and topology using methods of algebraic geometry and singularity theory.

Typically, if we consider that an ecosystem evolves with a period corresponding to the time for maturation, possessing few dozen of cycles would require to count species over few centuries. One well known example of a long data set is the number of Canadian lynx furs caught by the Hudson Bay company between 1821 and 1935 as reported by Elton and Nicholson in 1942. In spite of the relative quality of the data set (10 undersampled cycles), two low-dimensional global models that settle to chaotic attractors were obtained. They are compared with an ad hoc 3D model which was proposed as a possible model for this data set. The two global models, which were estimated with no prior knowledge about the dynamics, can be considered as direct evidences of chaos in real ecosystems.","J. Maquet1, C. Letellier1 & Luis A.

However, dilation-and-modulation systems cannot be derived from wavelet or Gabor systems. This study aims to investigate a class of dilation-and-modulation systems in the causal signal space L2(ℝ+). L2(ℝ+) can be identified as a subspace of L2(ℝ), which consists of all L2(ℝ)-functions supported on ℝ+ but not closed under the Fourier transform. Therefore, the Fourier transform method does not work in L2(ℝ+). Herein, we introduce the notion of Θa-transform in L2(ℝ+) and characterize the dilation-and-modulation frames and dual frames in L2(ℝ+) using the Θa-transform; and present an explicit expression of all duals with the same structure for a general dilation-and-modulation frame for L2(ℝ+). Furthermore, it has been proven that an arbitrary frame of this form is always nonredundant whenever the number of the generators is 1 and is always redundant whenever the number is greater than 1.

So these systems can be represented by signed bipartite networks, but the original unsigned node evaluation algorithm cannot be directly used on the signed networks. This paper proposes the Signed PageRank algorithm for signed bipartite networks to evaluate the object and user nodes at the same time. Based on the global information, the nodes can be sorted by the Signed PageRank values in descending order, and the result is SR Ranking. The authors analyze the characteristics of top and bottom nodes of the real networks and find out that for objects, the SR Ranking can provide a more reasonable ranking which combines the degree and rating of node, and the algorithm also can help us to identify users with specific rating patterns. By discussing the location of negative edges and the sensitivity of object SR Ranking to negative edges, the authors also explore that the negative edges play an important role in the algorithm and explain that why the bad reviews are more important in real networks.","Ke Gu1,2, Ying Fan2 & Zengru Di",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-021-0124-2,"Negative edges,node evaluation,online rating systems,signed PageRank"

260,Methods and Tools for Developing Intelligent Systems for Solving Complex Real-Time Adaptive Resource Management Problems,"Abstract We give the statement of the real-time adaptive enterprise resource management problem
and provide examples of contemporary adaptive resource management problems in various fields
of application, showing the dimension and other features of the problems being solved.
Requirements for the solution of the problems under consideration are stated, and general
principles improving the resource management adaptability are proposed. Existing approaches are
briefly analyzed, and their limitations are highlighted. A new methodology for solving the
problems under consideration is proposed, an overview of developments is given, and the first
experience of applying this methodology to the creation of intelligent resource management
systems is discussed. The possibility of solving extremely complex resource management problems
is shown by means of a modified ontology-based concept of the network of needs and capacities. In
the framework of this concept, the schedule is constructed as a “competitive equilibrium” in the
virtual market of a unified multiagent system, tuned to a specific enterprise with the use of
applied ontologies. An example of developing a prototype of an intelligent resource management
system for a multisatellite Earth remote sensing constellation and the results of its experimental
study are given. An approach to assessing the performance and efficiency of adaptive scheduling
models and methods developed for real-time resource management is proposed. Prospects for
further development of the approach to solving complex adaptive resource management problems
are shown.

Our goal is to minimize the overall costs, including the operating cost and the wake-up cost, while still guaranteeing the deadline of each individual task. In particular, we consider the homogeneous case in which it takes the same amount of time to serve each task and each task needs to be served by d seconds upon arrival. The problem involves two subproblems: (i) finding the best time to wake up the system and (ii) finding the best time to let the system go to sleep. We study the two subproblems in both off-line and on-line settings. In the off-line case that all task information is known a priori, we combine sample path analysis and dynamic programming to come up with the optimal solution. In the on-line scenario where future task information is completely unknown, we show that the optimal time to wake up the system can be obtained without relying on future task arrivals. We also perform competitive analysis for on-line control and derive the competitive ratios for both deterministic and random controllers.","Lei Miao

. Given any rational number 0 < x < 1 (say, x = 1/2) and any positive integer n, we count the number of elements of the sequence α, 2α, 3α, ..., nα modulo 1 that fall into the subinterval [0, x]. We prove that this counting number satisfies a central limit theorem in the following sense. First, we subtract the “expected number” nx from the counting number, and study the typical fluctuation of this difference as n runs in a long interval 1 ≤ n ≤ N. Depending on α and x, we may need an extra additive correction of constant times logarithm of N; furthermore, what we always need is a multiplicative correction: division by (another) constant times square root of logarithm of N. If N is large, the distribution of this renormalized counting number, as n runs in 1 ≤ n ≤ N, is very close to the standard normal distribution (bell shaped curve), and the corresponding error term tends to zero as N tends to infinity.

275,Positivstellensätze for real function algebras,"We look for algebraic certificates of positivity for functions which are not necessarily polynomial functions. Similar questions were examined earlier by Lasserre and Putinar [Positivity and optimization for semi-algebraic functions (to appear), Proposition 1] and by Putinar [A Striktpositivestellensatz for measurable functions (corrected version) (to appear), Theorem 2.1]. We explain how these results can be understood as results on hidden positivity: The required positivity of the functions implies their positivity when considered as polynomials on the real variety of the respective algebra of functions. This variety is however not directly visible in general. We show how algebras and quadratic modules with this hidden positivity property can be constructed. We can then use known results, for example Jacobi’s representation theorem (Jacobi in Math Z 237:259–273, 2001, Theorem 4), or the Krivine-Stengle Positivstellensatz (Marshall in Positive polynomials and sums of squares. Mathematical Surveys and Monographs 146, 2008, page 25), to obtain certificates of positivity relative to a quadratic module of an algebra of real-valued functions. Our results go beyond the results of Lasserre and Putinar, for example when dealing with non-continuous functions. The conditions are also easier to check.

277,Approximation algorithms for optimization of real-valued general conjugate complex forms,"Complex polynomial optimization has recently gained more attention in both theory and practice. In this paper, we study optimization of a real-valued general conjugate complex form over various popular constraint sets including the m-th roots of complex unity, the complex unit circle, and the complex unit sphere. A real-valued general conjugate complex form is a homogenous polynomial function of complex variables as well as their conjugates, and always takes real values. General conjugate form optimization is a wide class of complex polynomial optimization models, which include many homogenous polynomial optimization in the real domain with either discrete or continuous variables, and Hermitian quadratic form optimization as well as its higher degree extensions. All the problems under consideration are NP-hard in general and we focus on polynomial-time approximation algorithms with worst-case performance ratios. These approximation ratios improve previous results when restricting our problems to some special classes of complex polynomial optimization, and improve or equate previous results when restricting our problems to some special classes of polynomial optimization in the real domain. The algorithms are based on tensor relaxation and random sampling. Our novel technical contributions are to establish the first set of probability lower bounds for random sampling over the m-th root of unity, the complex unit circle, and the complex unit sphere, and to propose the first polarization formula linking general conjugate forms and complex multilinear forms. Some preliminary numerical experiments are conducted to show good performance of the proposed algorithms.","Taoran Fu1, Bo Jiang2 & Zhening Li",Journal of Global Optimization,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-017-0561-6,"General conjugate form,Complex polynomial optimization,Approximation algorithm,Complex tensor,Tensor relaxation,Random sampling,Probability bound"

279,Soap films and covering spaces,"A new mathematical model of soap films is proposed, called the “covering space model.” The two sides of a film are modeled as currents on different sheets of a covering space branching along the film boundary. Hence a film may be seen as the minimal cut separating one sheet of the covering space from the others. The film is thus the oriented boundary of one sheet, which represents the exterior of the film. As oriented boundaries, films may be calibrated with differential forms on the covering space, a version of the min-cut, max-flow duality of network theory. This model applies to unoriented films, films with singularities, films touching only part of a knotted curve, films that deformation retract to their boundaries, and other examples that have proved troublesome for previous soap film models.",Kenneth A.

283,Quaternion Matrix Optimization: Motivation and Analysis,"The class of quaternion matrix optimization (QMO) problems, with quaternion matrices as decision variables, has been widely used in color image processing and other engineering areas in recent years. However, optimization theory for QMO is far from adequate. The main objective of this paper is to provide necessary theoretical foundations on optimality analysis, in order to enrich the contents of optimization theory and to pave way for the design of efficient numerical algorithms as well. We achieve this goal by conducting a thorough study on the first-order and second-order (sub)differentiation of real-valued functions in quaternion matrices, with a newly introduced operation called R-product as the key tool for our calculus. Combining with the classical optimization theory, we establish the first-order and the second-order optimality analysis for QMO. Particular treatments on convex functions, the \(\ell _0\)-norm and the rank function in quaternion matrices are tailored for a sparse low rank QMO model, arising from color image denoising, to establish its optimality conditions via stationarity.

That paper established a parametrization of the set of all solutions to the inverse monodromy for canonical integral systems in terms of two continuous chains of matrix valued inner functions in the special case that the monodromy matrix was strongly regular (and the signature matrixJ was not definite). The correspondence between the chains and the solutions of this monodromy problem is one to one and onto. In this paper we study the solutions of this inverse problem for several different classes of chains which are specified by imposing assorted growth conditions and symmetries on the monodromy matrix and/or the matrizant (i.e., the fundamental solution) of the underlying equation. These external conditions serve to either fix or limit the class of admissible chains without computing them explicitly. This is useful because typically the chains are not easily accessible.","Damir Z.

Despite the fact that no complete error analysis for the method is yet available, the numerical results indicate that if no eigenvalues of \({\mathcal{M}}\) are close to the imaginary axis then the method computes the exact Hamiltonian Schur form of a nearby Hamiltonian matrix and thus is numerically strongly backward stable.

313,Land valuation using a real option approach,"This paper uses real option theory to asses the value of agricultural land that can be seeded with crops. We consider one- and two-factor models for the evolution of crop prices through time and derive a partial differential equation (PDE) for the land value. We model the potential selling decision of the land owner as a put option and incorporate it as a boundary condition in the PDE for the land price. We solve this equation numerically and show that theoretical prices are close to market land prices and that the value of the put option accounts for, at least, 25% of the total land value.

Hardy Spaces","We prove that the maximal Riesz operator $\sigma^{\alpha,\gamma}_*$ is of strong type from $L^1(\R) \cap H^p$ $ (\R)$ to $L^p (\R)$ for $\alpha, \gamma>0$ and $1/(1+\alpha) < p \le 1$, it is of weak type for $\alpha,\gamma>0$ and $1/(1+\alpha) = p$, and these results are best possible. The proofs are based on sharp estimates of the derivatives of the Riesz kernel. We characterize the real Hardy space $H^p(\R)$ in terms of $\sigma^{\alpha,1}_*$ for $1/(1+ \alpha) < p \le 1$, and draw consequences for real Hardy spaces on $\R^2$, as well. For example, an integrable function $f$ belongs to $H^1(\R)$ if and only if the maximal Fej\’er operator $\sigma^{1,1}_*$ applied to $f$ belongs to $L^1(\R)$.

315,The Infinite-Dimensional Standard and Strict Bounded Real Lemmas in Continuous Time: The Storage Function Approach,"The bounded real lemma (BRL) is a classical result in systems theory, which provides a linear matrix inequality criterium for dissipativity, via the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) inequality. The BRL has many applications, among others in \(H^\infty \) control. Extensions to infinite dimensional systems, although already present in the work of Yakubovich, have only been studied systematically in the last few decades. In this context various notions of stability, observability and controllability exist, and depending on the hypothesis one may have to allow the KYP-inequality to have unbounded solutions which forces one to consider the KYP-inequality in a spatial form. In the present paper we consider the BRL for continuous time, infinite dimensional, linear well-posed systems. Via an adaptation of Willems’ storage function approach we present a unified way to address both the standard and strict forms of the BRL. We avoid making use of the Cayley transform and work only in continuous time. While for the standard bounded real lemma, we obtain analogous results as there exist for the discrete time case, when treating the strict case additional conditions are required, at least at this stage. This might be caused by the fact that the Cayley transform does not preserve exponential stability, an important property in the strict case, when transferring a continuous-time system to a discrete-time system.","J.

In particular, this is the case when the matrices A and B are very large the computational cost, prohibitive, of solving, with high accuracy, systems of equations involving these matrices. Usually, the optimization approach involves optimizing the Rayleigh quotient.We first propose alternative objective functions to solve the (generalized) eigenproblem via (unconstrained) optimization, and we describe the variational properties of these functions.We then introduce some optimization algorithms (based on one of these formulations) designed to compute the largest eigenpair. According to preliminary numerical experiments, this work could lead the way to practical methods for computing the largest eigenpair of a (very) large symmetric matrix (pair).",M. Mongeau1 & M.

318,Capacity Choice in (Strategic) Real Options Models: A Survey,"The theory of real options determines the optimal time to invest in a project of given size. As a main result, it is found that in a more uncertain environment, it is optimal for a firm to delay its investment. In other words, uncertainty generates a “value of waiting.” Recently, contributions appeared that in addition determine the optimal size of the investment. This paper surveys this literature. As a general result, it is obtained that more uncertainty results in larger investments taking place at a later point in time. So, where from the traditional real options literature one can conclude that uncertainty is bad for growth, this is not so clear anymore when also the size of the investment needs to be determined. The survey consists of two parts. First, we present single firm models, and second, we give an overview of the oligopoly models that have appeared up until now.","Nick F. D. Huberts1, Kuno J. M.

319,A dynamical model for real economy and finance,"We have studied a discrete time dynamical model with four variables and delays, describing the interaction between a three-sector real economy and a financial market with four assets. Investors and financial intermediaries have heterogeneous beliefs. We show that complexity related to the evolution of state variables emerges and we investigate interdependence among economic fluctuations and assets volatility. By means of stability analysis we have found that real economy influences the existence of equilibrium prices in financial markets and that risky asset prices as well as capital per capita reach zero only when the elasticity of substitution between capital and labour is low enough. Bifurcation analysis shows that an increase of bond return would decrease the price of all the assets, conversely when the bond return decreases fluctuations and complex dynamics may arise. Due to the complexity of the model, computational tools are used to investigate long run dynamics, thus showing that for sufficiently high values of the interest rate bifurcations with repetitive structure emerge. In addition, we show how the total number of shares in each sector influences its price volatility. Finally, when fluctuations appear, economic policy intended to increase employment could stabilise the model only in sufficiently developed economies.","F. Grassetti

In particular, we establish the conjecture for all genus 1 fillings of the circle, extending P. Pu’s result in genus 0. We translate the problem into a question about closed ovalless real surfaces. The conjecture then results from a combination of two ingredients. On the one hand, we exploit integral geometric comparison with orbifold metrics of constant positive curvature on real surfaces of even positive genus. Here the singular points are Weierstrass points. On the other hand, we exploit an analysis of the combinatorics on unions of closed curves, arising as geodesics of such orbifold metrics.","V.

322,A New delay control method for real-time flows,"This paper presents a novel control algorithm to decrease the worst-case delay bound for high rate homogeneous and heterogeneous real-time flows when the network traffic load becomes heavy. The algorithm is adaptive based on the instantaneous network situations. It employs a generalized form of traditional (σ,ρ) regulator called the generalized (σ,ρ,λ) regulator that operates like the (σ,ρ) regulator under the normal network traffic load situation, but provides more regulations for the heavy network traffic load situation. For a set of real-time flows, we can show that D

 and D

g
 are the worst-case delay bounds with the (σ,ρ,λ) regulator and the (σ,ρ) regulator respectively. More specifically, we have developed a set of formulas to set the parameters for the new regulator so as to reduce the worst-case delay bounds for the real-time flows. We can prove that there exists a threshold input rate ρ* such that D

rg
 = D

329,Wall Polynomials on the Real Line: A Classical Approach to OPRL Khrushchev’s Formula,"The standard proof of Khrushchev’s formula for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle given in Khrushchev (J Approx Theory 108:161–248, 2001, J Approx Theory 116:268–342, 2002) combines ideas from continued fractions and complex analysis, depending heavily on the theory of Wall polynomials. Using operator theoretic tools instead, Khrushchev’s formula has been recently extended to the setting of orthogonal polynomials on the real line in the determinate case (Grünbaum and Velázquez in Adv Math 326:352–464, 2018). This paper develops a theory of Wall polynomials on the real line, which serves as a means to prove Khrushchev’s formula for any sequence of orthogonal polynomials on the real line. This real line version of Khrushchev’s formula is used to rederive the characterization given in Simon (J Approx Theory 126:198–217, 2004) for the weak convergence of \(p_n^2\mathrm{d}\mu \), where \(p_n\) are the orthonormal polynomials with respect to a measure \(\mu \) supported on a bounded subset of the real line (Theorem 8.1). The generality and simplicity of such a Khrushchev’s formula also permits the analysis of the unbounded case. Among other results, we use this tool to prove that no measure \(\mu \) supported on an unbounded subset of the real line yields a weakly convergent sequence \(p_n^2\mathrm{d}\mu \) (Corollary 8.10), but there exist instances such that \(p_n^2\mathrm{d}\mu \) becomes vaguely convergent (Example 8.5 and Theorem 8.6). Some other asymptoptic results related to the convergence of \(p_n^2\mathrm{d}\mu \) in the unbounded case are obtained via Khrushchev’s formula (Theorems 8.3, 8.7, 8.8, Proposition 8.4, Corollary 8.9). In the bounded case, we include a simple diagrammatic proof of Khrushchev’s formula on the real line which sheds light on its graph theoretical meaning, linked to Pólya’s recurrence theory for classical random walks.","M.

Such signals are described by real quasipolynomials, i.e. by linear combinations of real damped sinusoids multiplied by power functions. In a particular case when poles are simple, a real quasipolynomial becomes a real damped sinusoid. An explicit expression of the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for the estimation of frequencies and damping factors of the signals is obtained. To derive the CRB, we use the expression for the Fisher information matrix (FIM) which we obtained in a previous paper for the model of complex quasipolynomials (i.e. complex exponentials multiplied by complex polynomials). We rewrite the model of real quasipolynomials as a model of complex quasipolynomials with constraints imposed on the parameter set. Then we make use of the formula presented by Gorman and Hero that allows us to obtain the CRB for the model with constraints from the FIM for the model without constraints.

The application of IoT in manufacturing industry can dramatically improve business process efficiency and promote organizational performance. However, firms tend to hesitate in the investment decisions, which poses great challenges to the IoT application progress.

338,Real-time scheduling optimization considering the unexpected events in home health care,"Home health care, a new kind of health services that can be given in home for special populations (elderly, disabled, youth, etc.), is usually less expensive, more convenient and more efficient. Based on the face-to-face (in-person) interviews, we find that scheduling arrangements of home health care are often affected by some unexpected events such as cancellation of services, demand for emergency care and medical device failures. These events may lead to medical scheduling conflicts and therefore might decrease patient satisfaction due to the delayed service. Considering the emergencies in the home health care, this study takes the home health care mode under the unexpected events as the research object and focuses on the time window constraints involved in the real-time scheduling problem. In order to obtain an optimal medical dispatch program and ensure patients’ golden period for treatment, we establish an effective real-time scheduling model to minimize the total required time of scheduling, and propose an improved memetic algorithm to optimize the model. Empirical analysis was then adopted to verify the rationality of the model.

This is the well-known Trombi–Varadarajan theorem for spherical functions on the real reductive group, G. Even though \(\mathcal {C}^{p}(G//K)\) is a closed subalgebra of \(\mathcal {C}^{p}(G),\) a similar theorem has not however been successfully proved for the full Schwartz convolution algebra \(\mathcal {C}^{p}(G)\) except; for \(\mathcal {C}^{p}(G/K)\) (whose method is essentially that of Trombi–Varadarajan, as shown by M. Eguchi); for few specific examples of groups (notably \(G=SL(2,\mathbb {R})\)) and; for some notable values of p (with restrictions on G and/or on members of \(\;\mathcal {C}^{p}(G)\)). In this paper, we construct an appropriate image of the Harish-Chandra Fourier transform for the full Schwartz convolution algebra \(\mathcal {C}^{p}(G),\) without any restriction on any of G, p and members of \(\;\mathcal {C}^{p}(G).\) Our proof, that the Harish-Chandra Fourier transform, \(f\mapsto \mathcal {H}f,\) is a linear topological algebra isomorphism on \(\mathcal {C}^{p}(G),\) equally shows that its image \(\mathcal {C}^{p}(\widehat{G})\) can be nicely decomposed, that the full invariant harmonic analysis is available and implies that the definition of the Harish-Chandra Fourier transform may now be extended to include all p-tempered distributions on G and to the zero-Schwartz spaces.","Olufemi O.

With feedback,"We consider the possibility of free receptor (antigen/cytokine) levels rebounding to higher than the baseline level after the application of an antibody drug using a target-mediated drug disposition model. It is assumed that the receptor synthesis rate experiences homeostatic feedback from the receptor levels. It is shown for a very fast feedback response, that the occurrence of rebound is determined by the ratio of the elimination rates, in a very similar way as for no feedback. However, for a slow feedback response, there will always be rebound. This result is illustrated with an example involving the drug efalizumab for patients with psoriasis. It is shown that slow feedback can be a plausible explanation for the observed rebound in this example.","Philip J. Aston1, Gianne Derks1, Balaji M.

347,"Randomness of the square root of 2 and the Giant Leap, Part 1","We prove that the “quadratic irrational rotation” exhibits a central limit theorem. More precisely, let α be an arbitrary real root of a quadratic equation with integer coefficients; say, α = \( \sqrt 2 \). Given any rational number 0 < x < 1 (say, x = 1/2) and any positive integer n, we count the number of elements of the sequence α, 2α, 3α, …, nα modulo 1 that fall into the subinterval [0, x]. We prove that this counting number satisfies a central limit theorem in the following sense. First, we subtract the “expected number” nx from the counting number, and study the typical fluctuation of this difference as n runs in a long interval 1 ≤ n ≤ N. Depending on α and x, we may need an extra additive correction of constant times logarithm of N; furthermore, what we always need is a multiplicative correction: division by (another) constant times square root of logarithm of N. If N is large, the distribution of this renormalized counting number, as n runs in 1 ≤ n ≤ N, is very close to the standard normal distribution (bell shaped curve), and the corresponding error term tends to zero as N tends to infinity. This is the main result of the paper (see Theorem 1.1). The proof is rather complicated and long; it has many interesting detours and byproducts. For example, the exact determination of the key constant factors (in the additive and multiplicative norming), which depend on α and x, requires surprisingly deep algebraic tools such as Dedeking sums, the class number of quadratic fields, and generalized class number formulas. The crucial property of a quadratic irrational is the periodicity of its continued fraction. Periodicity means self-similarity, which leads us to Markov chains: our basic probabilistic tool to prove the central limit theorem. We also use a lot of Fourier analysis. Finally, I just mention one byproduct of this research: we solve an old problem of Hardy and Littlewood on diophantine sums.The whole paper consists of an introduction and 17 sections.

348,"Separation, dimension, and facet algorithms for node flow polyhedra","Production planning problems such as an Available to Promise (ATP) model of Chen et al. (2002) can involve material compatibility constraints that specify when components from various suppliers can be feasibly assembled into a final product. In a companion paper to Chen et al. (2002), Ball et al. (2003) showed that in many cases such constraints can be modeled as the set of feasible source-sink flows through an acyclic network. The flow through a node is the sum of the flows on all paths containing it. The number of paths is often exponential in the number of nodes, and so it is more computationally tractable to consider the set of node flows in place of that of path flows. Here nodes represent components and paths represent product configurations. In the context of NP hard Mixed Integer Programming models such as the ATP model, when the description of the set of node flows is too complicated to be explicitly written out, the material compatibility constraints can be handled in a cutting plane framework by using a separation algorithm. Ball et al. characterized the polyhedron of node flows for some special cases. We extend this work in various practical and theoretical directions: we allow arbitrary directed networks, we allow both upper and lower bounds on flows, we characterize which valid inequalities are facets, we give fast algorithms for separation, violation, and dimension, and we put all the pieces together into an algorithm for facet-separation. All algorithms are very efficient, as they are based on max flow and min-cost flow subroutines.","Maren Martens2, S.

n to R, and λ is the eigenvalue map from the set of n × n complex matrices to C
n, ordering the eigenvalues lexicographically. For example, if f is the function “maximum real part”, then f ∘ λ is the spectral abscissa, while if f is “maximum modulus”, then f ∘ λ is the spectral radius. Both these spectral functions are continuous, but they are neither convex nor Lipschitz. For our analysis, we use the notion of subgradient extensively analyzed in Variational Analysis, R.T. Rockafellar and R. J.-B. Wets (Springer, 1998). We show that a necessary condition for Y to be a subgradient of an eigenvalue function f ∘ λ at X is that Y
* commutes with X. We also give a number of other necessary conditions for Y based on the Schur form and the Jordan form of X. In the case of the spectral abscissa, we refine these conditions, and we precisely identify the case where subdifferential regularity holds. We conclude by introducing the notion of a semistable program: maximize a linear function on the set of square matrices subject to linear equality constraints together with the constraint that the real parts of the eigenvalues of the solution matrix are non-positive. Semistable programming is a nonconvex generalization of semidefinite programming.

The procedure uses a single sample path of the diffusion and involves two estimators, one temporal and one spatial. We first apply the test to simulated data generated from a variety of one-dimensional diffusions. We then apply our test to interest rate data and real exchange rate data. The application to real exchange rate data is of particular interest, since a consequence of the law of one price (or the theory of purchasing power parity) is that real exchange rates should be stationary. With the exception of the GBP/USD real exchange rate, we find evidence that interest rates and real exchange rates are generally non-stationary.

This extension is important for establishing a seamless real-time software development framework. Formalisms help describe a system unambiguously. If formal models are implemented without any consistent frameworks, however, it is hard to guarantee that there is no semantic gap between models and codes. Real-Time DEVS, named RTDEVS, is an extension of DEVS that can be characterized in three perspectives: the real time execution of models, the addition of time interval functions, and the activity specification for each state. After analyzing a system, the framework based on RTDEVS helps to expand each model of the system for executing in a real-time environment. In order to support the RTDEVS formalism, we propose abstract executive concepts based on the abstract simulator concepts of the DEVS formalism. Also, we implement an RTDEVS execution engine, named DEVS Executive, which runs on real-time Mach.","Joon Sung Hong1, Hae-Sang Song1, Tag Gon Kim1 & …Kyu Ho Park",Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,1997,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1008262409521,"Discrete event system specification,executability,formal methods,real-time software"

Since only a low fixed number of iterations can be executed in real time, it is not possible to solve each quadratic program to optimality. However, numerical experiments show that, if we use information from the numerical solution of the previous quadratic program to construct a warm start for the current quadratic program, there is a time step after which the usual stopping criteria will be satisfied within the fixed number of iterations for all subsequent optimization problems. This phenomenon is called subsequent convergence and will be analyzed for families of nonlinear equations.

The problem is to find the distance of a given stable matrix from the set of unstable matrices. A new method, based on the properties of the Kronecker sum and two other composite matrices, is developed to study this problem; this new method makes it possible to distinguish real perturbations from complex ones. Although a procedure to find the exact value of the distance is still not available, some explicit lower bounds on the distance are obtained. The bounds are applicable only for the case of real plant perturbations, and are easy to compute numerically; if the matrix is large in size, an iterative procedure is given to compute the bounds. Various examples including a 46th-order spacecraft system are given to illustrate the results obtained. The examples show that the new bounds obtained can have an arbitrary degree of improvement over previously reported ones.",L. Qiu1 & E. J.

Similar estimates are given for the class of real Vandermonde matrices, the class of row-scaled real Vandermonde matrices, and the class of Krylov matrices with Hermitian argument. Improved bounds are derived for the case where the abscissae or eigenvalues are included in a given real interval. Our findings confirm that all such matrices – including for instance the famous Hilbert matrix – are ill-conditioned already for “moderate” order.

Given a metrizable space we exhibit a universal space for all extended metric spaces compatible with the topology.

409,"The category of ultrametric spaces is isomorphic to the
category of complete, atomic, tree-like, and real graduated
lattices LAT*","It is proved that for any ultrametric space (X, d), 
the set L(X) of its closed
balls is a lattice 
\( (\mathbf{L}(X), \bigcap, \mathrm{sup}, r(B)) \). 
It is complete, atomic, tree-like, and real graduated.
For any such lattice 
\( (L, \bigwedge, \bigvee, r) \)
, the set A(L) 
of its atoms can be naturally equipped with
an ultrametric 
\( \Delta (x,y) \). 
These assignments are inverse of one another:
\( (\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{L}(X)), \Delta) = (X,d)\quad \mathrm{and}\quad (L, \bigwedge, \bigvee, r) = (\mathbf{L}(\mathbf{A}(L)), \bigcap, \mathrm{sup}, r(B)) \)
where the first equality means an isometry while the second one is a lattice isomorphism.
A similar correspondence established for morphisms, shows that there is an isomorphism of
categories. The category ULTRAMETR of ultrametric spaces 
and non-expanding maps is isomorphic to the category LAT* 
of complete, atomic, tree-like, real graduated lattices and
isotonic, semi-continuous, non-extensive maps. We describe properties of the isomorphism
functor and its relations to the categorical operations and action of other functors. Basic
properties of a space (such as completeness, spherical completeness, total boundedness,
compactness, etc.) are translated into algebraic properties of the corresponding lattice

After introducing the notion of uniformly semi-normalized classes of differential equations, we compute the equivalence groupoid of the class under study and show that it is uniformly semi-normalized. More specifically, each admissible transformation in the class is the composition of a linear superposition transformation of the corresponding initial equation and an equivalence transformation of this class. This allows us to apply the new version of the algebraic method based on uniform semi-normalization and reduce the group classification of the class under study to the classification of low-dimensional appropriate subalgebras of the associated equivalence algebra. The partition into classification cases involves two integers that characterize Lie symmetry extensions and are invariant with respect to equivalence transformations.","Célestin Kurujyibwami1,2, Peter Basarab-Horwath2 & Roman O.

To deal with real-time systems whose time issues become essential, different extensions of Petri nets with time have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, a new scheduling and control technique for real-time systems modeled by ordinary P-time Petri nets is proposed. Its goal is to provide a scheduling for a particular firing sequence, without any violation of timing constraints ensuring that no deadline is missed. It is based on the firing instant notion and it consists in determining an inequality system generated for a possible evolution (in terms of a feasible firing sequence for the untimed underlying Petri net) of the model.

In this article, assuming that the powered Hardy–Littlewood maximal operator satisfies some Fefferman–Stein vector-valued maximal inequality on X as well as it is bounded on both the weak ball quasi-Banach function space WX and the associated space, the authors establish various Littlewood–Paley function characterizations of \(WH_X({{\mathbb {R}}}^n)\) under some weak assumptions on the Littlewood–Paley functions. The authors also prove that the real interpolation intermediate space \((H_{X}({{\mathbb {R}}}^n),L^\infty ({{\mathbb {R}}}^n))_{\theta ,\infty }\), between the Hardy space associated with X, \(H_{X}({{\mathbb {R}}}^n)\), and the Lebesgue space \(L^\infty ({\mathbb R}^n)\), is \(WH_{X^{{1}/{(1-\theta )}}}({{\mathbb {R}}}^n)\), where \(\theta \in (0, 1)\). All these results are of wide applications. Particularly, when \(X:=M_q^p({{\mathbb {R}}}^n)\) (the Morrey space), \(X:=L^{\vec {p}}({{\mathbb {R}}}^n)\) (the mixed-norm Lebesgue space) and \(X:=(E_\Phi ^q)_t({{\mathbb {R}}}^n)\) (the Orlicz-slice space), all these results are even new; when \(X:=L_\omega ^\Phi ({\mathbb R}^n)\) (the weighted Orlicz space), the result on the real interpolation is new and, when \(X:=L^{p(\cdot )}({{\mathbb {R}}}^n)\) (the variable Lebesgue space) and \(X:=L_\omega ^\Phi ({{\mathbb {R}}}^n)\), the Littlewood–Paley function characterizations of \(WH_X({{\mathbb {R}}}^n)\) obtained in this article improves the existing results via weakening the assumptions on the Littlewood–Paley functions.","Songbai Wang1, Dachun Yang

When working on big data, it is of great necessity to consider the online version of PCA, in which only a small subset of samples could be stored. To handle the online PCA problem, Oja (1982) presented the stochastic power method under the assumption of zero-mean samples, and there have been lots of theoretical analysis and modified versions of this method in recent years. However, a common circumstance where the samples have nonzero mean is seldom studied. In this paper, we derive the convergence rate of a nonzero-mean version of Oja’s algorithm with diminishing stepsizes. In the analysis, we succeed in handling the dependency between each iteration, which is caused by the updated mean term for data centering. Furthermore, we verify the theoretical results by several numerical tests on both artificial and real datasets.

We shall argue that from an intuitive point of view, by considering paraconsistent negations as formalizing that particular kind of opposition, one needs not worry with issues about the meaning of true contradictions and the like, given that “true contradictions” are not involved in these paraconsistent logics. Our strategy will consist in showing that, on the one hand, the natural translation for subcontrariety in formal languages is not a contradiction in natural language, and on the other, translating alleged cases of contradiction in natural language to paraconsistent formal systems works only provided we transform them into a subcontrariety. Transforming contradictions into subcontrariety shall provide for an intuitive interpretation for paraconsistent negation, which we also discuss here. By putting all those pieces together, we hope a clearer sense of paraconsistency can be made, one which may liberate us from the need to tame contradictions.",Jonas R.

The coefficients for the cosecant expansion can be evaluated by using: (1) numerous recurrence relations, (2) expressions resulting from the application of the partition method for obtaining a power series expansion and (3) the result given in Theorem 3. Unlike the related Bernoulli numbers, these rational coefficients, which are called the cosecant numbers and are denoted by c

. These numbers are related to the Euler numbers and can also be evaluated by numerous recurrence relations, some of which involve the cosecant numbers. The approaches used to obtain the power series expansions for these fundamental trigonometric functions in addition to the methods used to evaluate their coefficients are employed in the derivation of power series expansions for integer powers and arbitrary powers of the trigonometric functions. Recurrence relations are of limited benefit when evaluating the coefficients in the case of arbitrary powers. Consequently, power series expansions for the Legendre-Jacobi elliptic integrals can only be obtained by the partition method for a power series expansion. Since the Bernoulli and Euler numbers give rise to polynomials from exponential generating functions, it is shown that the cosecant and secant numbers gives rise to their own polynomials from trigonometric generating functions. As expected, the new polynomials are related to the Bernoulli and Euler polynomials, but they are found to possess far more interesting properties, primarily due to the convergence of the coefficients. One interesting application of the new polynomials is the re-interpretation of the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula, which yields a new regularisation formula.",Victor Kowalenko,Acta Applicandae Mathematicae,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10440-011-9604-z,"Absolute convergence,Asymptotic series,Bernoulli numbers,Bernoulli polynomials,Borel summation,Conditional convergence,Cosecant numbers,Cosecant polynomials,Divergent series,Euler-Maclaurin summation formula,Elliptic integrals,Equivalence,Euler numbers,Euler polynomials,Generalised cosecant numbers,Generalised secant numbers,Generating function,Laplace transform,Mellin-Barnes regularisation,Partition,Partition method for a power series expansion,Power series expansion,Recurrence relation,Regularisation,Remainder,Secant numbers,Secant polynomials,Zeta function"

435,The Analysis and the Representation of Balanced Complex Polytopes in 2D,"In this paper, we deepen the theoretical study of the geometric structure of a balanced complex polytope (b.c.p.), which is the generalization of a real centrally symmetric polytope to the complex space. We also propose a constructive algorithm for the representation of its facets in terms of their associated linear functionals. The b.c.p.s are used, for example, as a tool for the computation of the joint spectral radius of families of matrices. For the representation of real polytopes, there exist well-known algorithms such as, for example, the Beneath–Beyond method. Our purpose is to modify and adapt this method to the complex case by exploiting the geometric features of the b.c.p. However, due to the significant increase in the difficulty of the problem when passing from the real to the complex case, in this paper, we confine ourselves to examine the two-dimensional case. We also propose an algorithm for the computation of the norm the unit ball of which is a b.c.p.",Cristina Vagnoni1 & Marino Zennaro,Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-008-9032-2,"Balanced complex polytopes,Polytope norms,Constructive algorithms"
436,Monic Chebyshev pseudospectral differentiation matrices for higher-order IVPs and BVPs: applications to certain types of real-life problems,"We introduce new differentiation matrices based on the pseudospectral collocation method. Monic Chebyshev polynomials (MCPs) were used as trial functions in differentiation matrices (D-matrices). Those matrices have been used to approximate the solutions of higher-order ordinary differential equations (H-ODEs). Two techniques will be used in this work. The first technique is a direct approximation of the H-ODE. While the second technique depends on transforming the H-ODE into a system of lower order ODEs. We discuss the error analysis of these D-matrices in-depth. Also, the approximation and truncation error convergence have been presented to improve the error analysis. Some numerical test functions and examples are illustrated to show the constructed D-matrices’ efficiency and accuracy.","M. Abdelhakem

438,On Segal–Bargmann analysis for finite Coxeter groups and its heat kernel,"We prove identities involving the integral kernels of three versions (two being introduced here) of the Segal–Bargmann transform associated to a finite Coxeter group acting on a finite dimensional, real Euclidean space (the first version essentially having been introduced around the same time by Ben Saïd and Ørsted and independently by Soltani) and the Dunkl heat kernel, due to Rösler, of the Dunkl Laplacian associated with the same Coxeter group. All but one of our relations are originally due to Hall in the context of standard Segal–Bargmann analysis on Euclidean space. Hall’s results (trivial Dunkl structure and arbitrary finite dimension) as well as our own results in μ-deformed quantum mechanics (non-trivial Dunkl structure, dimension one) are particular cases of the results proved here. So we can understand all of these versions of the Segal–Bargmann transform associated to a Coxeter group as Hall type transforms. In particular, we define an analogue of Hall’s Version C generalized Segal–Bargmann transform which is then shown to be Dunkl convolution with the Dunkl heat kernel followed by analytic continuation. In the context of Version C we also introduce a new Segal–Bargmann space and a new transform associated to the Dunkl theory. Also we have what appears to be a new relation in this context between the Segal–Bargmann kernels for Versions A and C.",Stephen Bruce Sontz,Mathematische Zeitschrift,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00209-010-0711-8,"Segal–Bargmann analysis,Heat kernel analysis,Coxeter group,Dunkl operator"
439,On Spectral Analysis and a Novel Algorithm for Transmission Eigenvalue Problems,"The transmission eigenvalue problem, besides its critical role in inverse scattering problems, deserves special interest of its own due to the fact that the corresponding differential operator is neither elliptic nor self-adjoint. In this paper, we provide a spectral analysis and propose a novel iterative algorithm for the computation of a few positive real eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the transmission eigenvalue problem. Based on approximation using continuous finite elements, we first derive an associated symmetric quadratic eigenvalue problem (QEP) for the transmission eigenvalue problem to eliminate the nonphysical zero eigenvalues while preserve all nonzero ones. In addition, the derived QEP enables us to consider more refined discretization to overcome the limitation on the number of degrees of freedom. We then transform the QEP to a parameterized symmetric definite generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) and develop a secant-type iteration for solving the resulting GEPs. Moreover, we carry out spectral analysis for various existence intervals of desired positive real eigenvalues, since a few lowest positive real transmission eigenvalues are of practical interest in the estimation and the reconstruction of the index of refraction. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method can find those desired smallest positive real transmission eigenvalues accurately, efficiently, and robustly.","Tiexiang Li1, Wei-Qiang Huang2, Wen-Wei Lin2 & …Jijun Liu",Journal of Scientific Computing,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-014-9923-0,"Transmission eigenvalues,Quadratic eigenvalue problems,Symmetric positive definite,Spectral analysis,Secant-type iteration method"

In this second part, we provide local and global convergence analyses of the Newton’s method for real symmetric matrices. Our proposed framework discovers a new eigenvalue update rule and shows that the errors in eigenvalue and eigenvector estimations are comparable, which extends to nonsymmetric diagonalizable matrices as well. At the end, we provide numerical experiments for generalized eigenvalue problems and for the trust region subproblem discussed in Adachi et al. (SIAM J Optim 27(1):269–291, 2017) to confirm efficiency and accuracy of our proposed method.","Yunho Kim

442,Uncertainty Principle for Real Functions in Free Metaplectic Transformation Domains,"This study devotes to the uncertainty principle under the free metaplectic transformation (an abbreviation of the metaplectic operator with a free symplectic matrix) of a real function. Covariance matrices in time, frequency and time–frequency domains are defined, and a relationship between these matrices and the free metaplectic transformation domain covariance is proposed. We then obtain two versions of lower bounds on the uncertainty product of the covariances of a real function in two free metaplectic transformation domains. It is shown here that a multivariable square integrable real-valued function cannot be both two free metaplectic transformations band limited. It is also seen that these two lower bounds depend not only on the minimum singular value of the blocks \({\mathbf {A}}_j,{\mathbf {B}}_j\), \(j=1,2\) found in free symplectic matrices but also on the covariance in time domain or in frequency domain. We thus reduce them to a new one which does not contain the covariances in time and frequency domains. Sufficient conditions that reach the lower bounds are derived. Example and simulation results are provided to validate the theoretical analysis.","Zhichao Zhang1,2,",Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00041-019-09686-w,"Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle,Metaplectic transformation,Free symplectic matrix,Inequality,Covariance matrix,Trace,Singular value"
443,Multidimensional constant linear systems,"A continuous resp. discrete r-dimensional (r≥1) system is the solution space of a system of linear partial differential resp. difference equations with constant coefficients for a vector of functions or distributions in r variables resp. of r-fold indexed sequences. Although such linear systems, both multidimensional and multivariable, have been used and studied in analysis and algebra for a long time, for instance by Ehrenpreis et al. thirty years ago, these systems have only recently been recognized as objects of special significance for system theory and for technical applications. Their introduction in this context in the discrete one-dimensional (r=1) case is due to J. C. Willems. The main duality theorem of this paper establishes a categorical duality between these multidimensional systems and finitely generated modules over the polynomial algebra in r indeterminates by making use of deep results in the areas of partial differential equations, several complex variables and algebra. This duality theorem makes many notions and theorems from algebra available for system theoretic considerations. This strategy is pursued here in several directions and is similar to the use of polynomial algebra in the standard one-dimensional theory, but mathematically more difficult. The following subjects are treated: input-output structures of systems and their transfer matrix, signal flow spaces and graphs of systems and block diagrams, transfer equivalence and (minimal) realizations, controllability and observability, rank singularities and their connection with the integral respresentation theorem, invertible systems, the constructive solution of the Cauchy problem and convolutional transfer operators for discrete systems. Several constructions on the basis of the Gröbner basis algorithms are executed.

504,The application of joint sparsity and total variation minimization algorithms to a real-life art restoration problem,"On March 11, 1944, the famous Eremitani Church in Padua (Italy) was destroyed in an Allied bombing along with the inestimable frescoes by Andrea Mantegna et al. contained in the Ovetari Chapel. In the last 60 years, several attempts have been made to restore the fresco fragments by traditional methods, but without much success. One of the authors contributed to the development of an efficient pattern recognition algorithm to map the original position and orientation of the fragments, based on comparisons with an old gray level image of the fresco prior to the damage. This innovative technique allowed for the partial reconstruction of the frescoes. Unfortunately, the surface covered by the colored fragments is only 77 m2, while the original area was of several hundreds. This means that we can reconstruct only a fraction (less than 8%) of this inestimable artwork. In particular the original color of the blanks is not known. This begs the question of whether it is possible to estimate mathematically the original colors of the frescoes by making use of the potential information given by the available fragments and the gray level of the pictures taken before the damage. Moreover, is it possible to estimate how faithful such a restoration is? In this paper we retrace the development of the recovery of the frescoes as an inspiring and challenging real-life problem for the development of new mathematical methods. Then we shortly review two models recently studied independently by the authors for the recovery of vector valued functions from incomplete data, with applications to the recolorization problem. The models are based on the minimization of a functional which is formed by the discrepancy with respect to the data and additional regularization constraints. The latter refer to joint sparsity measures with respect to frame expansions, in particular wavelet or curvelet expansions, for the first functional and functional total variation for the second. We establish relations between these two models. As a major contribution of this work we perform specific numerical test on the real-life problem of the A. Mantegna’s frescoes and we compare the results due to the two methods.","Massimo Fornasier1, Ronny Ramlau1 & Gerd Teschke2,",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-008-9103-6,"Recolorization,Inpainting,Wavelet regularization,TV regularization,Multi-channel data,Joint sparsity"

We prove that a suitable estimate of nonconvexity of graphs over all lines induces a ‘nice’ estimate of the nonconvexity of graphs of the entire function. Here, the term ‘nice’ means that in the well-known Michael selection theorem it is possible to replace convex sets of a multivalued mapping by such nonconvex sets. As a corollary, we obtain positive results for polynomials of degree two under some restrictions on coefficients. Our previous results concerned the polynomials of degree one and Lipschitz functions. We show that for a family of polynomials of degree three such estimate of convexity in general does not exist.

The splines are designed by fast computational algorithms that utilize the relation between splines and cubic interpolation polynomials. These splines provide an efficient tool for real-time signal processing. As an input, the splines use either clean or noised arbitrarily-spaced samples. Formulas for the spline’s extrapolation beyond the sampling interval are established. Sharp estimations of the approximation errors are presented. The capability to adapt the grid to the structure of an object and to have minimal requirements to the operating memory are of great advantages for offline processing of signals and multidimensional data arrays. The designed splines serve as a source for generating real-time wavelet transforms to apply to signals in scenarios where the signal’s samples subsequently arrive one after the other at random times. The wavelet transforms are executed by six-tap weighted moving averages of the signal’s samples without delay. On arrival of new samples, only a couple of adjacent transform coefficients are updated in a way that no boundary effects arise.","Amir Averbuch1, Pekka Neittaanmäki3, Etay Shefi2 & …Valery Zheludev1,",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-016-9504-x,"Local splines,Quasi-interpolating splines,Real-time wavelet transform,Discrete vanishing moments"

523,On the Problem of Describing    Holomorphically Homogeneous Real Hypersurfaces    of Four-Dimensional Complex Spaces,"Abstract We discuss two fragments of a large problem that extends the author’s recently completed similar studies in the space \(\mathbb C^3\) to the next dimension. One of the fragments is related to the local description of nonspherical holomorphically homogeneous strictly pseudoconvex hypersurfaces in \(\mathbb C^4\) with stabilizers of submaximal dimension. Using the Moser normal form technique and the properties of subgroups of the unitary group \(\mathrm U(3)\), we show that up to holomorphic equivalence there exist only two such surfaces. Both of them are natural generalizations of known homogeneous hypersurfaces in the space \(\mathbb C^3\).   In the second part of the paper, we consider a technique of holomorphic realization in \(\mathbb C^4\) of abstract seven-dimensional Lie algebras that correspond, in particular, to homogeneous hypersurfaces with trivial stabilizer. Some sufficient conditions for the Lie algebras are obtained under which the orbits of all realizations of such algebras are Levi degenerate.   The schemes of studying holomorphically homogeneous hypersurfaces that were used in the two-dimensional (É. Cartan) and three-dimensional (Doubrov, Medvedev, and The; Fels and Kaup; Beloshapka and Kossovskiy; Loboda) situations and resulted in full descriptions of such hypersurfaces turn out to be quite efficient in the case of greater dimension of the ambient space as well.

533,Visualizing Planar and Space Implicit Real Algebraic Curves with Singularities,"This paper presents a new method for visualizing implicit real algebraic curves inside a bounding box in the 2-D or 3-D ambient space based on numerical continuation and critical point methods. The underlying techniques work also for tracing space curve in higher-dimensional space. Since the topology of a curve near a singular point of it is not numerically stable, the authors trace only the curve outside neighborhoods of singular points and replace each neighborhood simply by a point, which produces a polygonal approximation that is e-close to the curve. Such an approximation is more stable for defining the numerical connectedness of the complement of the projection of the curve in ℝ2, which is important for applications such as solving bi-parametric polynomial systems. The algorithm starts by computing three types of key points of the curve, namely the intersection of the curve with small spheres centered at singular points, regular critical points of every connected components of the curve, as well as intersection points of the curve with the given bounding box. It then traces the curve starting with and in the order of the above three types of points.

As a result, an iteration step of the dual method involves only the integration of auxiliary systems of ordinary differential equations over short time intervals. A real-time algorithm is described for calculating optimal feedback controls. The results are illustrated by the optimal control problem for a second-order stationary system with a fixed delay.","R.

In this article, we introduce the anisotropic product Musielak-Orlicz Hardy space \(H_{\vec A}^\varphi \left( {{\mathbb{R}^n} \times {\mathbb{R}^m}} \right)\) via the anisotropic Lusin-area function and establish its atomic characterization, the \(\vec g\)
-function characterization, the \(\vec g_\lambda ^*\)-function characterization and the discrete wavelet characterization via first giving out an anisotropic product Peetre inequality of Musielak-Orlicz type. Moreover, we prove that finite atomic decomposition norm on a dense subspace of \(H_{\vec A}^\varphi \left( {{\mathbb{R}^n} \times {\mathbb{R}^m}} \right)\) is equivalent to the standard infinite atomic decomposition norm. As an application, we show that, for a given admissible triplet (\(\left( {\varphi ,q,\vec s} \right)\)), if T is a sublinear operator and maps all (\(\left( {\varphi ,q,\vec s} \right)\))-atoms into uniformly bounded elements of some quasi-Banach spaces B, then T uniquely extends to a bounded sublinear operator from \(H_{\vec A}^\varphi \left( {{\mathbb{R}^n} \times {\mathbb{R}^m}} \right)\) to B.

546,Rank-1 Approximation for Entangled Multipartite Real Systems,"The interaction of multiple parts with each other within a system according to certain intrinsic rules is a crucial natural phenomenon. The notion of entanglement and its decomposition of high-dimensional arrays is particularly intriguing since it opens a new way of thinking in data processing and communication, of which the applications will be broad and significant. Depending on how the internal parts engage with each other, there are different types of entanglements with distinct characteristics. This paper concerns the approximation over a multipartite system whose subsystems consist of symmetric rank-1 matrices that are entangled via the Kronecker tensor product. Such a structure resembles that arising in quantum mechanics where a mixed state is to be approximated by its nearest separable state, except that the discussion in this paper is limited to real-valued matrices. Unlike the conventional low-rank tensor approximations, the added twist due to the involvement of the Kronecker product destroys the multi-linearity, which makes the problem harder. As a first step, this paper explores the rank-1 multipartite approximation only. Reformulated as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem and a nonlinear singular value problem, respectively, the problem can be tackled numerically by power-like iterative methods and SVD-like iterative methods. The iteration in both classes of methods can be implemented cyclically or acyclically. Motivations, schemes, and convergence theory are discussed in this paper. Preliminary numerical experiments suggest these methods are effective and efficient when compared with some general-purpose optimization packages.","Matthew M. Lin

547,Associated Legendre Functions and Spherical Harmonics of Fractional Degree and Order,"Trigonometric formulas are derived for certain families of associated Legendre functions of fractional degree and order, for use in approximation theory. These functions are algebraic, and when viewed as Gauss hypergeometric functions, belong to types classified by Schwarz, with dihedral, tetrahedral, or octahedral monodromy. The dihedral Legendre functions are expressed in terms of Jacobi polynomials. For the last two monodromy types, an underlying ‘octahedral’ polynomial, indexed by the degree and order and having a nonclassical kind of orthogonality, is identified, and recurrences for it are worked out. It is a (generalized) Heun polynomial, not a hypergeometric one. For each of these families of algebraic associated Legendre functions, a representation of the rank-2 Lie algebra \(\mathfrak {so}(5,\mathbb {C})\) is generated by the ladder operators that shift the degree and order of the corresponding solid harmonics. All such representations of \(\mathfrak {so}(5,\mathbb {C})\) are shown to have a common value for each of its two Casimir invariants. The Dirac singleton representations of \(\mathfrak {so}(3,2)\) are included.","Robert S. Maier

This is a specialization of van der Walt’s vector-valued Hausdorff continuity. The Dedekind order completion of continuous functions under product orders follows. Product ordered Sendov continuous functions pass the same property on to their codomain components, and in finite dimensions this is an equivalence. Hausdorff continuity behaves similarly. New ways to transform interval functions and Sendov and Hausdorff continuous functions using bounded linear operators are defined. An interpretation of Hausdorff continuity that is essentially basis independent results: Hausdorff continuity belongs basis independently to finite Euclidean space, and therefore to multivariate real analysis. Infinite dimensional real separable Hilbert space is also considered, with interesting results relevant to the study of Hilbert space.","Robert Watson

Thus, the fundamental entities of which we consider our Universe to be composed cannot be particles, fields or strings. In this paper the numbers are considered as the fundamental entities. We discuss the construction of the corresponding physical theory. A hypothesis on the quantum fluctuations of the number field is advanced for discussion. If these fluctuations actually take place then instead of the usual quantum mechanics over the complex number field a new quantum mechanics over an arbitrary field must be developed. Moreover, it is tempting to speculate that a principle of invariance of the fundamental physical laws under a change of the number field does hold. The fluctuations of the number field could appear on the Planck length, in particular in the gravitational collapse or near the cosmological singularity. These fluctuations can lead to the appearance of domains with non-Archimedean p-adic or finite geometry. We present a short review of the p-adic mathematics necessary, in this context.",Igor V.

We pay particular attention to the case that there is at most one nonnegative eigenvector per eigenvalue, giving a number of sufficient conditions.

559,Acoustic scattering at a hard–soft lining transition in a flow duct,"An explicit Wiener–Hopf solution is derived to describe the scattering of sound at a hard–soft wall impedance transition at x = 0, say, in a circular duct with uniform mean flow of Mach number M. A mode, incident from the upstream hard section, scatters at x = 0 into a series of reflected modes and a series of transmitted modes. Of particular interest is the role of a possible instability along the lined wall in combination with the edge singularity. If one of the “upstream” running modes is to be interpreted as a downstream-running instability, an extra degree of freedom in the Wiener–Hopf analysis occurs that can be resolved by application of some form of Kutta condition at x = 0, for example a more stringent edge condition where wall streamline deflection \(h={\mathcal{O}}(x^{3/2})\) at the downstream side. In general, the effect of this Kutta condition is significant, but it is particularly large for the plane wave at low frequencies and should therefore be easily measurable. For small Helmholtz numbers, the reflection coefficient modulus |R
001| tends to (1 + M)/(1−M) without and to 1 with Kutta condition, while the end correction tends to ∞ without and to a finite value with Kutta condition. This is exactly the same behaviour as found for reflection at a pipe exit with flow, irrespective if this is uniform or jet flow. Although the presence of the instability in the model is hardly a question anymore since it has been confirmed numerically, a proper mathematical causality analysis is still not totally watertight. Therefore, the limit of a vortex sheet, separating zero flow from mean flow, approaching the wall has been explored. Indeed, this confirms that the Helmholtz unstable mode of the free vortex sheet transforms into the suspected mode and remains unstable. As the lined-wall vortex-sheet model predicts unstable behaviour for which experimental evidence is at best rare and indirect, the question may be raised if this model is indeed a consistent simplification of reality, doing justice to the double limit of small perturbations and a thin boundary layer. Numerical time-domain methods suffer from this instability and it is very important to decide whether the instability is at least physically genuine. Experiments based on the present problem may provide a handle to resolve this stubborn question.",Sjoerd W.

560,The chemical basis of morphogenesis,"It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns onHydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis.The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.",A.

561,"Real-time onboard wind and windshear determination, part 1: Identification","Standard wind identification techniques employed in the analysis of aircraft accidents are post-facto techniques; they are processed after the event has taken place and are based on the complete time histories of the DFDR/ATCR data along the entire trajectory. By contrast, real-time wind identification techniques are processed while the event is taking place; they are based solely on the knowledge of the preceding time histories of the DFDR/ATCR data.In this paper, a real-time wind identification technique is developed. First, a 3D-kinematic approach is employed in connection with the DFDR/ATCR data covering the time interval τ preceding the present time instant. The aircraft position, inertial velocity, and accelerometer bias are determined by matching the flight trajectory computed from the DFDR data with the flight trajectory available from the ATCR data. This leads to a least-square problem, which is solved analytically every β seconds, with β/τ small.With the inertial velocity and accelerometer bias known, an extrapolation process takes place so as to predict the inertial velocity profile over the subsequent β-subinterval. At the end of this subinterval, the extrapolated inertial velocity and the newly identified inertial velocity are statistically reconciled and smoothed. Then, the process of identification, extrapolation, reconciliation, and smoothing is repeated. Subsequently, the wind is computed as the difference between the inertial velocity and the airspeed, which is available from the DFDR data. With the wind identified, windshear detection can take place (Ref. 1).As an example, the real-time wind identification technique is applied to Flight Delta 191, which crashed at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on August 2, 1985. The numerical results show that the wind obtained via real-time identification is qualitatively and quantitatively close to the wind obtained via standard identification. This being the case, it is felt that real-time wind identification can be useful in windhsear detection and guidance, above all if the shear/downdraft factor signal is replaced by the wind difference signal (Ref. 1).","A.

562,Real-time dispatch optimization for concentrating solar power with thermal energy storage,"Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants present a promising path towards utility-scale renewable energy. The power tower, or central receiver, configuration can achieve higher operating temperatures than other forms of CSP, and, like all forms of CSP, naturally pairs with comparatively inexpensive thermal energy storage, which allows CSP plants to dispatch electricity according to market price incentives and outside the hours of solar resource availability. Currently, CSP plants commonly include a steam Rankine power cycle and several heat exchange components to generate high-pressure steam using stored thermal energy. The efficiency of the steam Rankine cycle depends on the temperature of the plant’s operating fluid, and so is a main concern of plant operators. However, the variable nature of the solar resource and the conservatism with which the receiver is operated prevent perfect control over the receiver outlet temperature. Therefore, during periods of solar variability, collection occurs at lower-than-design temperature. To support operator decisions in a real-time setting, we develop a revenue-maximizing non-convex mixed-integer, quadradically-constrained program which determines a dispatch schedule with sub-hourly time fidelity and considers temperature-dependent power cycle efficiency. The exact nonlinear formulation proves intractable for real-time decision support.

563,A study of singular spectrum analysis with global optimization techniques,"Singular spectrum analysis has recently become an attractive tool in a broad range of applications. Its main mechanism of alternating between rank reduction and Hankel projection to produce an approximation to a particular component of the original time series, however, deserves further mathematical justification. One paramount question to ask is how good an approximation that such a straightforward apparatus can provide when comparing to the absolute optimal solution. This paper reexamines this issue by exploiting a natural parametrization of a general Hankel matrix via its Vandermonde factorization. Such a formulation makes it possible to recast the notion of singular spectrum analysis as a semi-linear least squares problem over a compact feasible set, whence global optimization techniques can be employed to find the absolute best approximation. This framework might not be immediately suitable for practical application because global optimization is expectedly more expensive, but it does provide a theoretical baseline for comparison. As such, our empirical results indicate that the simpler SSA algorithm usually is amazingly sufficient as a handy tool for constructing exploratory model. The more complicated global methods could be used as an alternative of rigorous affirmative procedure for verifying or assessing the quality of approximation.","Moody T. Chu1, Matthew M.

Let \(M \subset {\mathbb {C}}^{n+1}\), \(n \ge 2\), be a connected compact real-analytic codimension-two submanifold with only nondegenerate CR singularities. Suppose M is a diffeomorphic image via a real-analytic CR map of a real-analytic hypersurface in \({\mathbb {C}}^n \times {\mathbb {R}}\) with only nondegenerate CR singularities. Then there exists a unique compact real-analytic Levi-flat hypersurface, nonsingular except possibly for self-intersections, with boundary M.

565,Detection Thresholds in Very Sparse Matrix Completion,"We study the matrix completion problem: an underlying \(m \times n\) matrix P is low rank, with incoherent singular vectors, and a random \(m \times n\) matrix A is equal to P on a (uniformly) random subset of entries of size dn. All other entries of A are equal to zero. The goal is to retrieve information on P from the observation of A. Let \(A_1\) be the random matrix where each entry of A is multiplied by an independent \(\{0,1\}\)-Bernoulli random variable with parameter 1/2. This paper is about when, how and why the non-Hermitian eigen-spectra of the matrices \(A_1 (A - A_1)^*\) and \((A-A_1)^*A_1\) captures more of the relevant information about the principal component structure of A than the eigen-spectra of \(A A^*\) and \(A^* A\). We show that the eigenvalues of the asymmetric matrices \(A_{1} (A - A_{1})^{*}\) and \((A-A_{1})^{*} A_{1}\) with modulus greater than a detection threshold are asymptotically equal to the eigenvalues of \(PP^*\) and \(P^*P\) and that the associated eigenvectors are aligned as well. The central surprise is that by intentionally inducing asymmetry and additional randomness via the \(A_1\) matrix, we can extract more information than if we had worked with the singular value decomposition (SVD) of A. The associated detection threshold is asymptotically exact and is non-universal since it explicitly depends on the element-wise distribution of the underlying matrix P. We show that reliable, statistically optimal but not perfect matrix recovery, via a universal data-driven algorithm, is possible above this detection threshold using the information extracted from the asymmetric eigen-decompositions. Averaging the left and right eigenvectors provably improves estimation accuracy but not the detection threshold. Our results encompass the very sparse regime where d is of order 1 where matrix completion via the SVD of A fails or produces unreliable recovery. We define another variant of this asymmetric principal component analysis procedure that bypasses the randomization step and has a detection threshold that is smaller by a constant factor but with a computational cost that is larger by a polynomial factor of the number of observed entries. Both detection thresholds allow to go beyond the barrier due to the well-known information theoretical limit \(d \asymp \log n\) for exact matrix completion found in the literature.","Charles Bordenave1, Simon Coste2 & Raj Rao Nadakuditi",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-022-09568-6,"Matrix completion,Sparse random graphs,Eigenvalues,Spectral algorithms,Non-Hermitian matrices"

These polynomials satisfy a non-hermitian orthogonality on certain contours in the complex plane. This fact allows the formulation of a Riemann-Hilbert problem whose solution is given in terms of these Laguerre polynomials. The asymptotic analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem is carried out by the steepest descent method of Deift and Zhou, in the same spirit as done by Deift et al. for the case of orthogonal polynomials on the real line.

574,Self-adjointness in quantum mechanics: a pedagogical path,"Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by self-adjoint operators on Hilbert space. Such ubiquitous, well-known, and very foundational fact, however, is traditionally subtle to be explained in typical first classes in quantum mechanics, as well as to senior physicists who have grown up with the lesson that self-adjointness is “just technical”. The usual difficulties are to clarify the connection between the demand for certain physical features in the theory and the corresponding mathematical requirement of self-adjointness, and to distinguish between self-adjoint and hermitian operator not just at the level of the mathematical definition but most importantly from the perspective that mere hermiticity, without self-adjointness, does not ensure the desired physical requirements and leaves the theory inconsistent. In this work, we organise an amount of standard facts on the physical role of self-adjointness into a coherent pedagogical path aimed at making quantum observables emerge as necessarily self-adjoint, and not merely hermitian operators. Next to the central core of our line of reasoning—the necessity of a non-trivial declaration of a domain to associate with the formal action of an observable, and the emergence of self-adjointness as a consequence of fundamental physical requirements—we include some complementary materials consisting of a few instructive mathematical proofs and a short retrospective, ranging from the past decades to the current research agenda, on the self-adjointness problem for quantum Hamiltonians of relevance in applications.","Andrea Cintio

This paper aims at providing some first contributions in this direction, both from a theoretical point of view (such as precise definitions of computable Riemann surfaces and computable analytic functions) and a practical one (how to compute bounds and analytic continuations in a reasonably efficient way).We started to implement some of the algorithms in the MMXLIB library.

However, there is no known bounds on the maximal number of distinct Heigenvectors in general. We prove that for any m ⩾ 2, an m-order 2-dimensional tensor A exists such that A has 2(m − 1) distinct H-eigenpairs. We give examples of 4-order 2-dimensional tensors with six distinct H-eigenvalues as well as six distinct H-eigenvectors. We demonstrate the structure of eigenpairs for a higher order tensor is far more complicated than that of a matrix. Furthermore, we introduce a new class of weakly symmetric tensors, called p-symmetric tensors, and show under certain conditions, p-symmetry will effectively reduce the maximal number of distinct H-eigenvectors for a given two-dimensional tensor. Lastly, we provide a complete classification of the H-eigenvectors of a given 4-order 2-dimensional nonnegative p-symmetric tensor.

605,An algebraic approach to approximate evaluation of a polynomial on a set of real points,"The previous best algorithm for approximate evaluation of a polynomial on a real set was due to Rokhlin and required of the order ofmu+nu
3 infinite precision arithmetic operations to approximate [on a fixed bounded setX(m) ofm+1 real points] a degreen polynomial\(p\left( z \right) = \sum\nolimits_{i = 0}^n {p_i x^i } \) within the error bound\(2^{ - u} \sum\nolimits_{i = 0}^n {\left| {p_i } \right|} \). We develop an approximation algorithm which exploits algebraic computational techniques and decreases Rokhlin's record estimate toO(mlog2
u+nmin-u, logn}). For logu=o(logn), this result may also be favorably compared with the record boundO(m+n)log2
n) on the complexity of the exact multipoint polynomial evaluation. The new algorithm can be performed in the fields (or rings) generated by the input values, which enables us to decrease the precision of the computations [by using modular (residue) arithmetic] and to simplify our computations further in the case whereu=O(logn). Our algorithm allows NC and simultaneously processor efficient parallel implementation. Because of the fundamental nature of the multipoint polynomial evaluation, our results have further applications to numerical and algebraic computational problems. In passing, we also show a substantial improvement in the Chinese remainder algorithm for integers based on incorporating Kaminski's fast residue computation.","Victor Y.

609,On properties of real selfadjoint operators,"In spite of the important applications of real selfadjoint operators and monotone operators, very few papers have dealt in depth with the properties of such operators. In the present paper, we follow A. Rhodius to define the spectrum \(\sigma _{\mathbb {F}}(T)\) and the numerical range \(W_{\mathbb {F}}(T)\) of a selfadjoint operator T acting on a Hilbert space H over the real/complex field \(\mathbb {F}\), and study their topological and geometrical properties which are well known in the complex case \({\mathbb {F}}={\mathbb {C}}\). If \(\mathbb F={\mathbb {R}}\), the results are new; if \({\mathbb {F}}={\mathbb {C}}\), the results constitute an expository body of results containing simple and short proofs of the known facts. The results are then applied to real selfadjoint operators and then to complex normal operators to sharpen their Borel functional calculi with new and shorter proofs avoiding the classical sophisticated Gelfand–Naimark theorem or the Berberian’s amalgamation theory. For such a real selfadjoint or complex normal operator N, a normed functional algebra \(L^\infty _{\mathbb {F}}(N)\) consisting of certain Borel functions defined on \(\sigma _{\mathbb {F}}(N)\) is constructed which inherits the isometric properties of the continuous functional calculus \(f\mapsto f(N):C_{\mathbb {F}}(\sigma _{\mathbb {F}}(N))\rightarrow B(H)\).","Moslem Karimzadeh1 & Mehdi Radjabalipour

610,Non-Self-Adjoint Toeplitz Matrices Whose Principal Submatrices Have Real Spectrum,"We introduce and investigate a class of complex semi-infinite banded Toeplitz matrices satisfying the condition that the spectra of their principal submatrices accumulate onto a real interval when the size of the submatrix grows to \(\infty \). We prove that a banded Toeplitz matrix belongs to this class if and only if its symbol has real values on a Jordan curve located in \({{\mathbb {C}}}{\setminus }\{0\}\). Surprisingly, it turns out that, if such a Jordan curve is present, the spectra of all the principal submatrices have to be real. The latter claim is also proved for matrices given by a more general symbol. The special role of the Jordan curve is further demonstrated by a new formula for the limiting density of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution for banded Toeplitz matrices from the studied class. Certain connections between the problem under investigation, Jacobi operators, and the Hamburger moment problem are also discussed. The main results are illustrated by several concrete examples; some of them allow an explicit analytic treatment, while some are only treated numerically.",Boris Shapiro1 & František Štampach,Constructive Approximation,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00365-017-9408-0,"Banded Toeplitz matrix,Asymptotic eigenvalue distribution,Real spectrum,Non-self-adjoint matrices,Moment problem,Jacobi matrices,Orthogonal polynomials"

Under some condition on the partition λ′ parametrizing \({\mathcal{O}^{\prime}}\), we prove that, if λ is the partition obtained from λ by adding a column on the very left, and \({\mathcal{O}}\) is the nilpotent coadjoint orbit parametrized by λ, then \({\mathcal{O}_\mathbb{C}= \tau (\tau^{\prime -1}(\mathcal{O}_\mathbb{C}^{\prime}))}\), where \({\tau, \tau^{\prime}}\) are the moment maps.

Our techniques use the theory of unbounded symmetric Toeplitz operators, some general theory of unbounded symmetric operators, classical Hardy spaces, and an application of the uniformization theorem. In addition, we completely characterize the possible valences for these real Smirnov functions when the valence is finite. To do so we construct Riemann surfaces we call disk trees by welding together copies of the unit disk and its complement in the Riemann sphere. We also make use of certain trees we call valence trees that mirror the structure of disk trees.","Timothy Ferguson1 & William T. Ross

A limit relation for the sharp coefficient in a pointwise estimate for the modulus of the n-th derivative of an analytic function in a disk is found as the point approaches the boundary circle. It is assumed that the boundary value of the real part of the function belongs to L
p. The relation in question contains the sharp constant from the estimate of the modulus of the n-th derivative of an analytic function in \( {\mathbb{C}_{+} } \).

630,"Distribution of Eigenvalues for the Ensemble of Real
Symmetric Toeplitz Matrices","Consider the ensemble of real symmetric Toeplitz matrices whose entries are
i.i.d. random variable from a fixed probability distributionpof mean 0,variance 1, and finite moments of all order. The limiting spectral measure (the density of normalized eigenvalues) converges weakly to a new universal distribution with unbounded support, independent of pThis distribution’s moments are almost those of the Gaussian’s, and the deficit may be interpreted in terms of obstructions to Diophantine equations; the unbounded
support follows from a nice application of the Central Limit Theorem. With a little more work, we obtain almost sure convergence. An investigation of spacings between adjacent normalized eigenvalues looks Poissonian, and not GOE. A related ensemble (real symmetric palindromic Toeplitz matrices) appears to have no Diophantine obstructions, and the limiting spectral measure’s first nine moments can be shown to agree with those of the Gaussian; this will be considered in greater detail in a future paper.","Christopher Hammond1,2 & Steven J.

The values of the function are measured continuously over a finite time interval with some error.
We propose an algorithm for the approximate calculation of a Caputo fractional derivative from
the measurement values based on the methods of feedback control theory. First, the problem of calculating the fractional derivative is replaced by
an inverse problem for a control system. Then the method of dynamic inversion is applied to the inverse problem,
which allows us to construct a real-time solution algorithm stable under information noises and computational errors.
The algorithm is based on N. N. Krasovskii’s extremal aiming method, which is widely known in the theory of guaranteed control,
and on a local modification of A. N. Tikhonov’s classical regularization method with a smoothing functional.
The order of convergence of the proposed algorithm is obtained, and a numerical example illustrating
the application of the developed technique for calculating Caputo fractional derivatives of specific functions in real time is considered.

The logical behaviors of CtlTPNs are represented by control class graphs (CCGs) which are untimed automata with timing and control information in their state transition labels. We prove that the CCG corresponding to a CtlTPN expresses completely the logical behavior of the CtlTPN. The real-time supervisor is based on a nondeterministic logical supervisor for the CCG, including the delay for control computations to ensure the supervisor is acceptable in a true real-time environment. We prove the existence of a unique maximal controllable sublanguage of a given specification language and present an algorithm to construct the sublanguage.

Here a well-known human sensing device, Kinect sensor is used which approximates the human body by virtue of 20 body joints and produces a data stream from which skeleton of the human body is traced. Sampling rate of the data stream is 30 frames per second where every frame represents a body gesture. The overall system is bifurcated into two parts. The offline part calculates 19 features from each frame representing a diseased gesture. These features are angle and distance information between 20 body joints. Features correspond to a definite pattern for a specific body gesture. In online part, triangular fuzzy matching based algorithm performs to detect real-time gestures with 90.57% accuracy. For achieving better accuracy, decision tree is enforced to separate sitting and standing body gestures. The proposed approach is observed to outperform several contemporary approaches in terms of accuracy while presenting a simple system which is based on medical knowledge and is capable of distinguishing as large as 25 gestures.","Sriparna Saha1, Monalisa Pal

655,A nonlinear programming technique to compute a tight lower bound for the real structured singular value,"The real structured singular value (RSSV, or real μ) is a useful measure to analyze the robustness of linear systems subject to structured real parametric uncertainty, and surely a valuable design tool for the control systems engineers. We formulate the RSSV problem as a nonlinear programming problem and use a new computation technique, F-modified subgradient (F-MSG) algorithm, for its lower bound computation. The F-MSG algorithm can handle a large class of nonconvex optimization problems and requires no differentiability. The RSSV computation is a well known NP hard problem. There are several approaches that propose lower and upper bounds for the RSSV. However, with the existing approaches, the gap between the lower and upper bounds is large for many problems so that the benefit arising from usage of RSSV is reduced significantly. Although the F-MSG algorithm aims to solve the nonconvex programming problems exactly, its performance depends on the quality of the standard solvers used for solving subproblems arising at each iteration of the algorithm. In the case it does not find the optimal solution of the problem, due to its high performance, it practically produces a very tight lower bound. Considering that the RSSV problem can be discontinuous, it is found to provide a good fit to the problem. We also provide examples for demonstrating the validity of our approach.","Ahmet Yazıcı1, Abdurrahman Karamancıoğlu2 & Refail Kasimbeyli",Optimization and Engineering,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-010-9120-4,"Robust control,Real structured singular value,Nonlinear programming,Modified subgradient algorithm"

To alleviate this deficiency, an algorithm is developed in which the rate of information processing is kept at a high value, while the system statistics are evaluated at a much slower rate.The method utilizes a combination of fast and slow filtering loops, in which the observable data are processed at a high rate during the fast loop, while the system error covariance, gain computations, and all other system statistics are processed at a lower rate in the slow loop. Methods are provided to resolve any incompatibility in the system statistics resulting from this fast-loop/slow-loop processing combination.Applications describing problems pertaining to aircraft navigation are presented. Specifically, applications to aircraft navigation through a satellite network are studied. Appropriate simulation results from the above studies are shown.",J. N. Damoulakis1 & G.

660,Tessellations of Homogeneous Spaces of Classical Groups of Real Rank Two,"Let H be a closed, connected subgroup of a connected, simple Lie group G with finite center. The homogeneous space G/H has a tessellation if there is a discrete subgroup Γ of G, such that Γ acts properly discontinuously on G/H, and the double-coset space Γ\G/H is compact. Note that if either H or G/H is compact, then G/H has a tessellation; these are the obvious examples.It is not difficult to see that if G has real rank one, then only the obvious homogeneous spaces have tessellations. Thus, the first interesting case is when G has real rank two. In particular, Kulkarni and Kobayashi constructed examples that are not obvious when G=SO(2, 2n)° or SU(2, 2n). Oh and Witte constructed additional examples in both of these cases, and obtained a complete classification when G=SO(2, 2n)°. We simplify the work of Oh-Witte, and extend it to obtain a complete classification when G=SU(2, 2n). This includes the construction of another family of examples.The main results are obtained from methods of Benoist and Kobayashi: we fix a Cartan decomposition G=K

664,A Trust-Region Framework for Real-Time Optimization with Structural Process-Model Mismatch,"Advances in optimization theory, software, and modeling environments promote widespread application of optimization-based decision making. However, the gap between the optimization model and the real-world counterpart impedes optimality of the solution and leads to loss of performance in practice. To overcome this barrier, this paper proposes to reconcile the model and the real plant with iterative parameter estimation and real-time optimization based on a trust-region framework. Three algorithms are developed with different means of constructing/maintaining the local model, managing the trust-region radius, and assessing the trial point. Analysis shows that all these algorithms converge to the correct first-order KKT point despite structural model mismatch. Case studies of reduced model-based optimization demonstrate effectiveness and performance of the proposed methods.","Kexin Wang1, Cheng Yang1, Zhijiang Shao1, Xiaojin Huang2 & …Lorenz T. Biegler

Namely, we show that the zero set of a real analytic Beltrami field on a real analytic, connected 3-manifold without boundary is either empty after removing its isolated points or can be written as a countable, locally finite union of differentiably embedded, connected 1-dimensional submanifolds with (possibly empty) boundary and tame knots. Further, we consider the question of how complicated these tame knots can possibly be. To this end, we prove that on the standard (open) solid toroidal annulus in \({\mathbb {R}}^3\), there exist for any pair (p, q) of positive, coprime integers countable infinitely many distinct real analytic metrics such that for each such metric, there exists a real analytic Beltrami field, corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+1\) of the curl operator, whose zero set is precisely given by a standard (p, q)-torus knot. The metrics and the corresponding Beltrami fields are constructed explicitly and can be written down in Cartesian coordinates by means of elementary functions alone.","Wadim Gerner

We find that under some mild assumptions on the semi-discrete frame and if f has exponential decay at \(\infty \), it suffices to know \(|f *\psi _\lambda |\) on suitably fine lattices to uniquely determine f (up to a global sign factor). We further establish a local stability property of our reconstruction problem. Finally, for two concrete examples of a (discrete) frame of \(L^2(\mathbb {R}^d)\), \(d=1,2\), we show that through sufficient oversampling one obtains a frame such that any real-valued function with exponential decay can be uniquely recovered from its unsigned frame coefficients.","Rima Alaifari1, Ingrid Daubechies2, Philipp Grohs1,3 & …Gaurav Thakur",Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00041-016-9513-7,"Phase retrieval,Semi-discrete frames,Injectivity,Stability,Sampling"

Recently, it was shown that, for many standard algorithms such as matrix multiplication, LU- or Cholesky decomposition, \(\gamma _k\) can be replaced by \(k\mathbf {u}\), and the restriction on k can be removed. However, the arguments make heavy use of specific properties of both the underlying set of floating-point numbers and the corresponding arithmetic. In this paper, we derive error estimates for the summation of real numbers where each sum is afflicted with some perturbation. Recent results on floating-point summation follow as a corollary, in particular error estimates for rounding to nearest and for directed rounding. Our new estimates are sharp and unveil the necessary properties of floating-point schemes to allow for a priori estimates of summation with a factor omitting higher order terms.","Marko Lange1 & Siegfried M.

In this paper, we consider phaseless sampling and reconstruction of real-valued signals in a high-dimensional shift-invariant space from their magnitude measurements on the whole Euclidean space and from their phaseless samples taken on a discrete set with finite sampling density. The determination of a signal in a shift-invariant space, up to a sign, by its magnitude measurements on the whole Euclidean space has been shown in the literature to be equivalent to its nonseparability. In this paper, we introduce an undirected graph associated with the signal in a shift-invariant space and use connectivity of the graph to characterize nonseparability of the signal. Under the local complement property assumption on a shift-invariant space, we find a discrete set with finite sampling density such that nonseparable signals in the shift-invariant space can be reconstructed in a stable way from their phaseless samples taken on that set. In this paper, we also propose a reconstruction algorithm which provides an approximation to the original signal when its noisy phaseless samples are available only. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm to reconstruct box spline signals from their noisy phaseless samples.","Cheng Cheng1, Junzheng Jiang2 & Qiyu Sun",Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00041-018-9639-x,"Shift invariant spaces,Phaseless sampling and reconstruction,Undirected graph,Sampling density,Local complementary property,Reconstruction algorithm"

In this article, the authors introduce the weak Hardy space \(WH_X({\mathbb {X}})\) associated with \(X({\mathbb {X}})\) via the grand maximal function, and characterize \(WH_X({\mathbb {X}})\) by other maximal functions and atoms. The authors then apply these characterizations to obtain the real interpolation and the boundedness of Calderón–Zygmund operators in the critical case. The main novelties of this article exist in that the authors use the Aoki–Rolewicz theorem and both the dyadic system and the exponential decay of approximations of the identity on \({\mathbb {X}}\), which closely connect with the geometrical properties of \({\mathbb {X}}\), to overcome the difficulties caused by the deficiency of both the triangle inequality of \(\Vert \cdot \Vert _{X({\mathbb {X}})}\) and the reverse doubling assumption of the measure \(\mu \) under consideration, and also use the relation between the convexification of \(X({\mathbb {X}})\) and the weak ball quasi-Banach function space \(WX({\mathbb {X}})\) associated with \(X({\mathbb {X}})\) to prove that the infinite summation of atoms converges in the space of distributions on \({\mathbb {X}}\). Moreover, all these results have a wide range of generality and, particularly, even when they are applied to the weighted Lebesgue space, the Orlicz space, and the variable Lebesgue space, the obtained results are also new and, actually, some of them are new even on RD-spaces (namely, spaces of homogeneous type satisfying the additional reverse doubling condition).","Jingsong Sun1, Dachun Yang

The existence, uniqueness and positivity analysis of the fractional order model is established, while the model is validated by fitting data on measles prevalence in Nigeria made available by the Nigerian Center for Disease Control relative to the year 2020, using the nonlinear least square algorithm. Using the estimated and fitted parameters, the basic reproduction number \(R_{ms}\) is obtained and found to be \(R_{ms}\approx 1.34\), which reveal that despite the vaccination and treatment as controls, at least an individual is still being infected on the average, which describes the failure of vaccination effort and coverage in the Nigerian nation. Also, the model system equilibria, called the measles-free and measles-endemic equilibrium were obtained and the measles-free equilibrium is shown to be locally and globally asymptotically stable if \(R_{ms}\) is less than unity. A numerical scheme under the ABC operator, which is a mixture of the two-step Lagrange polynomial and the fundamental theorem of fractional calculus, is used to obtain the approximate solutions of the fractional order measles model, which proved to be convergent and efficient.","Oluwatayo Michael Ogunmiloro

677,Orientation Maps in V1 and Non-Euclidean Geometry,"In the primary visual cortex, the processing of information uses the distribution of orientations in the visual input: neurons react to some orientations in the stimulus more than to others. In many species, orientation preference is mapped in a remarkable way on the cortical surface, and this organization of the neural population seems to be important for visual processing. Now, existing models for the geometry and development of orientation preference maps in higher mammals make a crucial use of symmetry considerations. In this paper, we consider probabilistic models for V1 maps from the point of view of group theory; we focus on Gaussian random fields with symmetry properties and review the probabilistic arguments that allow one to estimate pinwheel densities and predict the observed value of π. Then, in order to test the relevance of general symmetry arguments and to introduce methods which could be of use in modeling curved regions, we reconsider this model in the light of group representation theory, the canonical mathematics of symmetry. We show that through the Plancherel decomposition of the space of complex-valued maps on the Euclidean plane, each infinite-dimensional irreducible unitary representation of the special Euclidean group yields a unique V1-like map, and we use representation theory as a symmetry-based toolbox to build orientation maps adapted to the most famous non-Euclidean geometries, viz. spherical and hyperbolic geometry. We find that most of the dominant traits of V1 maps are preserved in these; we also study the link between symmetry and the statistics of singularities in orientation maps, and show what the striking quantitative characteristics observed in animals become in our curved models.",Alexandre Afgoustidis,The Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience (JMN),2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13408-015-0024-7,"Visual cortex,Orientation maps,Gaussian random fields,Euclidean invariance,Group representations,Non-Euclidean geometry,Pinwheel density,Kac–Rice formula"

In case 0≤m≤κ, we derive error estimates which fill in some gaps in the known theory; while in case m>κ we obtain previously unknown error estimates. In this latter case, we employ dilates of the function ϕ, where the dilation factor corresponds to the fill distance between the data points and the domain.",Michael J.

The discrete-time model is an especial case in modeling that satisfactorily describes the epidemiological dynamics because of the discrete nature of the real data. However, discrete models reduce their descriptive and fitting potential because of assuming a homogeneous population. Thus, in this paper, we proposed contagion probability functions according to two infection paradigms that consider factors associated with transmission dynamics. For example, we introduced probabilities of establishing an infectious interaction, the number of contacts with infectious and the level of connectivity or social distance within populations. Through the probabilities design, we overcame the homogeneity assumption. Also, we evaluated the proposed probabilities through their introduction into discrete-time models for two diseases and different study zones with real data, COVID-19 for Germany and South Korea, and dengue for Colombia. Also, we described the oscillatory dynamics for the last one using the contagion probabilities alongside parameters with a biological sense. Finally, we highlight the implementation of the proposed probabilities would improve the simulation of the public policy effect of control strategies over an infectious disease outbreak.","Alexandra Catano-Lopez

By optimizing the parametrization for each powertrain concept and by adapting the respective operating behaviour specifically to minimize the ecological impact, a reliable and unbiased comparison is enabled. We use our optimization environment with the Real Ecological Impact as objective function to compare different powertrain concepts on driving profiles that are based on real driving data recorded in Germany. Despite the fact that all of the considered driving profiles contain trips of similar length, their respective optimized powertrain concepts are different. Plug-In Hybrid vehicles achieve the greatest potential for long-range capable vehicles and are least sensitive to different driving profiles.","Arved Esser

When tasks are processed over multiple stages and are subject to end-to-end real-time constraints, these properties no longer hold and no obvious extensions are known. We consider a two-stage problem with homogeneous cost functions over all tasks at each stage and derive several new optimality properties. These properties lead to the idea of introducing “virtual” deadlines at the first stage, thus partially decoupling the stages so that the known efficient solutions for single-stage problems can be used. We prove that the solution obtained by an iterative virtual deadline algorithm (VDA) converges to the global optimal solution of the two-stage problem and illustrate the efficiency of the VDA through numerical examples.",Jianfeng Mao1 & Christos G.

For the case where \({\mathcal{A}}\) is unital, our main result asserts that a function \({\varphi \: \mathtt{ball}(\mathcal{A},p) \to B(V)}\), V a Hilbert space, is completely positive (defined suitably) if and only if it is positive definite and analytic for any locally convex topology for which \({\mathtt{ball}(\mathcal{A},p)}\) is open. If \({\eta_\mathcal{A} \: \mathcal{A} \to C^{*}(\mathcal{A},p)}\) is the enveloping C*-algebra of \({(\mathcal{A},p)}\) and \({e^{C^{*}(\mathcal{A}, p)}}\) is the c
0-direct sum of the symmetric tensor powers \({S^n(C^{*}(\mathcal{A},p))}\), then the above two properties are equivalent to the existence of a factorization \({\varphi = \Phi \circ \Gamma}\), where \({\Phi \: e^{C^{*}(\mathcal{A}, p)} \to B(V)}\) is linear completely positive and \({\Gamma(a) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \eta_\mathcal{A}(a)^{\otimes n}}\). We also obtain a suitable generalization to non-unital algebras. An important consequence of this result is a description of the unitary representations of the unitary group \({{\rm U}(\mathcal{A})}\) with bounded analytic extensions to \({\mathtt{ball}(\mathcal{A},p)}\) in terms of representations of the C*-algebra \({e^{C^{*}(\mathcal{A}, p)}}\).",Daniel Beltiţă1 & Karl-Hermann Neeb,Integral Equations and Operator Theory,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00020-015-2244-3,"22E66,22E65,46L05,46L07"

776,On real-valued SDE and nonnegative-valued SDE population models with demographic variability,"Population dynamics with demographic variability is frequently studied using discrete random variables with continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models. An approximation of a CTMC model using continuous random variables can be derived in a straightforward manner by applying standard methods based on the reaction rates in the CTMC model. This leads to a system of Itô stochastic differential equations (SDEs) which generally have the form \( d \mathbf {y} = \varvec{\mu } \, dt + G \, d \mathbf {W},\) where \(\mathbf {y}\) is the population vector of random variables, \(\varvec{\mu }\) is the drift vector, and G is the diffusion matrix. In some problems, the derived SDE model may not have real-valued or nonnegative solutions for all time. For such problems, the SDE model may be declared infeasible. In this investigation, new systems of SDEs are derived with real-valued solutions and with nonnegative solutions. To derive real-valued SDE models, reaction rates are assumed to be nonnegative for all time with negative reaction rates assigned probability zero. This biologically realistic assumption leads to the derivation of real-valued SDE population models. However, small but negative values may still arise for a real-valued SDE model. This is due to the magnitudes of certain problem-dependent diffusion coefficients when population sizes are near zero. A slight modification of the diffusion coefficients when population sizes are near zero ensures that a real-valued SDE model has a nonnegative solution, yet maintains the integrity of the SDE model when sizes are not near zero. Several population dynamic problems are examined to illustrate the methodology.","E. J. Allen

We analyze when such a system is on the boundary of the region of asymptotic stability, i.e., when it has purely imaginary eigenvalues, or how much the dissipation term has to be perturbed to be on this boundary. For unstructured systems the explicit construction of the real distance to instability (real stability radius) has been a challenging problem. We analyze this real distance under different structured perturbations to the dissipation term that preserve the DH structure and we derive explicit formulas for this distance in terms of low rank perturbations. We also show (via numerical examples) that under real structured perturbations to the dissipation the asymptotical stability of a DH system is much more robust than for unstructured perturbations.","Christian Mehl1, Volker Mehrmann

784,Sequential nonlinear estimation: regularized particle filter applied to the attitude estimation problem with real data,"The aim of this work is to analyze the robustness and computational effort of particle filter when applied to the attitude and gyro bias estimation problem. The particle filter is based on the sampling method for sequential importance, in which the basic idea is to represent the density function posteriori by a set of random samples (particles) associated with their respective weights. However, after a few interactions, degeneration of particles may occur. To avoid degeneration, the regularized version of the particle filter was applied. In such estimator, the particles with lower weight are discarded and those with greater weight give rise to new particles close to the areas of the highest probability. For analysis, the attitude dynamical model is described by quaternions, and the observation vector, composed by real data of attitude sensors that are on board the CBERS-2 (China–Brazil Earth Resource Satellite). The attitude sensors available are digital sun sensor, infrared Earth sensor, and mechanical gyros. The attitude and bias of gyro estimated by the regularized particle filter are compared with the unscented Kalman filter and the results show that for systems that do not have a high degree of nonlinearity, and under consideration of real data, the unscented Kalman filter has shown better performance than the regularized particle filter.","R.

It is well-known that there are many examples where the ordering cone of the image space has an empty (topological/algebraic) interior, for instance in optimal control, approximation theory, duality theory. Our aim is to consider Pareto-type solution concepts for such vector optimization problems based on the intrinsic core notion (a well-known generalized interiority notion). We propose a new Henig-type proper efficiency concept based on generalized dilating cones which are relatively solid (i.e., their intrinsic cores are nonempty). Using linear functionals from the dual cone of the ordering cone, we are able to characterize the sets of (weakly, properly) efficient solutions under certain generalized convexity assumptions. Toward this end, we employ separation theorems that are working in the considered setting.","Christian Günther

798,Certification of real inequalities: templates and sums of squares,"We consider the problem of certifying lower bounds for real-valued multivariate transcendental functions. The functions we are dealing with are nonlinear and involve semialgebraic operations as well as some transcendental functions like \(\cos ,\,\arctan ,\,\exp \), etc. Our general framework is to use different approximation methods to relax the original problem into polynomial optimization problems, which we solve by sparse sums of squares relaxations. In particular, we combine the ideas of the maxplus approximations (originally introduced in optimal control) and of the linear templates (originally introduced in static analysis by abstract interpretation). The nonlinear templates control the complexity of the semialgebraic relaxations at the price of coarsening the maxplus approximations. In that way, we arrive at a new—template based—certified global optimization method, which exploits both the precision of sums of squares relaxations and the scalability of abstraction methods. We analyze the performance of the method on problems from the global optimization literature, as well as medium-size inequalities issued from the Flyspeck project.","Victor Magron1, Xavier Allamigeon2, Stéphane Gaubert2 & …Benjamin Werner",Mathematical Programming,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-014-0834-5,"Polynomial optimization problems,Semidefinite programming,Semialgebraic relaxations,Maxplus approximation,Nonlinear template method,Certified global optimization"

In this article, the authors first obtain a decomposition for any distribution of the variable weak Hardy space into “good” and “bad” parts and then prove the following real interpolation theorem between the variable Hardy space \(H^{p(\cdot )}({\mathbb {R}}^n)\) and the space \(L^{\infty }({\mathbb {R}}^n)\): \((H^{p(\cdot )}(\mathbb R^n),L^{\infty }({\mathbb {R}}^n))_{\theta ,\infty }= WH^{p(\cdot )/(1-\theta )}({\mathbb {R}}^n),\quad \mathrm{where}~\theta \in (0,1), \mathrm{and}\) \(WH^{p(\cdot )/(1-\theta )}({\mathbb {R}}^n)\) denotes the variable weak Hardy space.

800,Elliptic bindings for dynamically convex Reeb flows on the real projective three-space,"The first result of this paper is that every contact form on \(\mathbb {R}P^3\) sufficiently \(C^\infty \)-close to a dynamically convex contact form admits an elliptic–parabolic closed Reeb orbit which is 2-unknotted, has self-linking number \(-1/2\) and transverse rotation number in (1 / 2, 1]. Our second result implies that any p-unknotted periodic orbit with self-linking number \(-1/p\) of a dynamically convex Reeb flow on a lens space of order p is the binding of a rational open book decomposition, whose pages are global surfaces of section. As an application we show that in the planar circular restricted three-body problem for energies below the first Lagrange value and large mass ratio, there is a special link consisting of two periodic trajectories for the massless satellite near the smaller primary—lunar problem—with the same contact-topological and dynamical properties of the orbits found by Conley (Commun Pure Appl Math 16:449–467, 1963) for large negative energies. Both periodic trajectories bind rational open book decompositions with disk-like pages which are global surfaces of section.

801,Mathematical Model of Tumour Spheroid Experiments with Real-Time Cell Cycle Imaging,"Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro tumour spheroid experiments are an important tool for studying cancer progression and potential cancer drug therapies. Standard experiments involve growing and imaging spheroids to explore how different conditions lead to different rates of spheroid growth. These kinds of experiments, however, do not reveal any information about the spatial distribution of the cell cycle within the expanding spheroid. Since 2008, a new experimental technology called fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) has enabled real-time in situ visualisation of the cell cycle progression. Observations of 3D tumour spheroids with FUCCI labelling reveal significant intratumoural structure, as the cell cycle status can vary with location. Although many mathematical models of tumour spheroid growth have been developed, none of the existing mathematical models are designed to interpret experimental observations with FUCCI labelling. In this work, we adapt the mathematical framework originally proposed by Ward and King (Math Med Biol 14:39–69, 1997. https://doi.org/10.1093/imammb/14.1.39) to produce a new mathematical model of FUCCI-labelled tumour spheroid growth. The mathematical model treats the spheroid as being composed of three subpopulations: (i) living cells in G1 phase that fluoresce red; (ii) living cells in S/G2/M phase that fluoresce green; and (iii) dead cells that are not fluorescent. We assume that the rates at which cells pass through different phases of the cell cycle, and the rate of cell death, depend upon the local oxygen concentration. Parameterising the new mathematical model using experimental measurements of cell cycle transition times, we show that the model can qualitatively capture important experimental observations that cannot be addressed using previous mathematical models. Further, we show that the mathematical model can be used to qualitatively mimic the action of anti-mitotic drugs applied to the spheroid. All software programs required to solve the nonlinear moving boundary problem associated with the new mathematical model are available on GitHub. at https://github.com/wang-jin-mathbio/Jin2021","Wang Jin1, Loredana Spoerri2, Nikolas K.

In this paper we study the “dual convolution product” of trace-class operators that corresponds to pointwise product in the Fourier algebra. Answering a question raised in work of Eymard and Terp, we provide an intrinsic description of this operation which does not rely on the identification with the Fourier algebra, and obtain a similar result for the connected component of this affine group. In both cases we construct explicit derivations on the corresponding Banach algebras, verifying the derivation identity directly without requiring the inverse Fourier transform. We also initiate the study of the analogous Banach algebra structure for trace-class operators on \(L^p({{\mathbb {R}}}^\times , dt/ |t|)\) for \(p\in (1,2)\cup (2,\infty )\).",Yemon Choi1 & Mahya Ghandehari,Complex Analysis and Operator Theory,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11785-021-01100-y,"Affine group,Coefficient space,Derivation,Dual convolution,Fourier algebra,Induced representation"

We give new proofs and counterexamples which demonstrate that such results become invalid for infinitely many criteria with respect to the original definition, in general, and we address the motivation and practical relevance of our findings for possible applications in stochastic optimization and decision-making under uncertainty.",Alexander Engau,Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-014-0608-5,"Proper efficiency,Multicriteria optimization,Multiobjective programming,Infinitely many criteria,Weighted-sum method,Tchebycheff norm,Scalarization"

We find exactly two invariants, J and W, which are expressed explicitly in terms of the graphing function F of M, the vanishing of which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for M to be locally biholomorphic to a model hypersurface, the tube over the light cone. If one of the two invariants J or W does not vanish on M, we show that the equivalence problem under biholomorphisms reduces to an equivalence problem between \(\{e \}\)-structures, that is, we construct an absolute parallelism on M.

In this article, when \(p\in (\omega /(\omega +\eta ),1]\), for the atomic Hardy spaces \(H_{\mathrm {cw}}^p(X)\) introduced by Coifman and Weiss, the authors establish their various real-variable characterizations, respectively, in terms of the grand maximal functions, the radial maximal functions, the non-tangential maximal functions, the various Littlewood–Paley functions and wavelet functions. This completely answers the question of Coifman and Weiss by showing that no additional (geometrical) condition is necessary to guarantee the radial maximal function characterization of \(H_{\mathrm {cw}}^1(X)\) and even of \(H_{\mathrm {cw}}^p(X)\) with p as above. As applications, the authors obtain the finite atomic characterizations of \(H^p_{\mathrm {cw}}(X)\), which further induce some criteria for the boundedness of sublinear operators on \(H^p_{\mathrm {cw}}(X)\). Compared with the known results, the novelty of this article is that \(\mu \) is not assumed to satisfy the reverse doubling condition and d is only a quasi-metric, moreover, the range \(p\in (\omega /(\omega +\eta ),1]\) is natural and optimal.","Ziyi He1, Yongsheng Han2, Ji Li3, Liguang Liu4, Dachun Yang1 & …Wen Yuan",Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00041-018-09652-y,"Space of homogeneous type,Hardy space,Maximal function,Atom,Littlewood–Paley function,Wavelet"

The existence of such domains was unexpected. The special domains Bieberbach considered are basins of attraction of a cubic Hénon map. This classical method of construction is one of the first applications of dynamical systems to complex analysis. In this paper, the boundaries of the real sections of Bieberbach’s domains will be calculated explicitly as the stable manifolds of the saddle points. The real filled Julia sets and the real Julia sets of Bieberbach’s map will also be calculated explicitly and illustrated with computer generated graphics. Basic differences between real and the complex dynamics will be shown.","Sandra Hayes1, Axel Hundemer2, Evan Milliken3 & …Tasos Moulinos",The Journal of Geometric Analysis,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12220-014-9518-x,"Hénon maps,Basin boundary,Stable manifolds,Julia sets"
810,On the Number of Limit Cycles in General Planar Piecewise Linear Differential Systems with Two Zones Having Two Real Equilibria,"A general family of planar piecewise linear ODEs with two zones both having a real focus and separated by a straight line is considered. By analyzing the number of zero points of a new function related to the intersection points of the trajectories of the linear subsystems with the separation line, complete results on the existence and number of limit cycles are obtained. In particular, complete parameter regions for the existence of 1–2 limit cycles are provided with two concrete examples, which will be helpful in studying some kinds of discontinuity-induced bifurcations (i.e., DIBs). Based on the main results, it is obtained that the family of planar piecewise linear ODEs with focus–focus dynamics separated by a straight line can have 3 limit cycles if and only if one subsystem has a real focus and the other one has a virtual focus. Moreover, it is showed that five is the least value of the number of parameters needed in canonical forms of such systems.","Song-Mei Huan

I will first analyse his definition of the implication and will show that this relation is not a consequence relation in his frame. Unlike the medieval logicians, he does not distinguish explicitly between material and formal consequences. The arguments discussed in al-Qiyās, where the conclusion is true only in some matters, and would seem close to a material consequence for that reason, are rejected explicitly as not syllogistic. He also rejects the ‘enthymemes’ unless they are complemented by their missing premise and the superfluous premises which, according to him, should promptly be ruled out. It seems then that the consequence relation in his theory is formal. It can be characterized as being ‘productivity in all matters’ or ‘necessary truth preserving’. It is illustrated by some (but not all) single premise arguments, and above all by all kinds of syllogisms which, in his theory, are more numerous and various than in Aristotle’s one. The syllogism may contain two or more premises, including disjunctive ones. When it is hypothetical, it may lead to several conclusions. The premises may be in conflict, but then, the conclusion is false. He thus rejects the principle according to which ‘anything follows from a contradiction’. But, unlike what some scholars say, he does not admit any connexive principle. In the compound syllogisms, the conclusion follows by steps, each step taking two premises at once.",Saloua Chatti,Logica Universalis,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11787-018-0210-y,"Primary 01-02,Secondary 03A05,03B99"

The objective of this article is to study the mathematical modeling of undetected cases of the novel coronavirus in Morocco. The model is shown to have disease-free and an endemic equilibrium point. We have discussed the local and global stability of these equilibria. The parameters of the model and undiscovered instances of COVID-19 were assessed by the least squares approach in Morocco and have been eliminated. We utilized a Matlab tool to show developments in undiscovered instances in Morocco and to validate predicted outcomes. Like results, until August 4, 2021, the total number of infected cases of COVID-19 in Morocco is 24,663,240, including 653,286 confirmed cases, against 24,009,954 undetected. Further, our approach gives a good approximation of the actual COVID-19 data from Morocco and will be used to estimate the undetected cases of COVID-19 in other countries of the world and to study other pandemics that have the same nature of spread as COVID-19.","Abdelouahed Alla Hamou1, Rando R.

The proposed methods are equivalent to the previously described two-step extragradient method for addressing variational inequality problems in real Hilbert spaces. Rather than using Lipschitz-type constant information or any other line search process, the presented methods use a different step-size rule based on local bifunction information. Under mild constraints such as Lipschitz continuity and pseudomonotonicity, strong convergence findings for the given techniques are well demonstrated. The primary results are used to generate solutions for variational inequalities and fixed point problems. Such findings are useful and contribute to the generalization of previous findings in the literature.

822,Intrinsic nilpotent approximation,"This report is a preliminary version of work on an intrinsic approximation process arising in the context of a nonisotropic pertubation theory for certain classes of linear differential and pseudodifferential operatorsP on a manifoldM. A basic issue is that the structure ofP itself determines the minimal information that the initial approximation must contain. This may vary from point to point, and requires corresponding approximate state spaces or phase spaces.This approximation process is most naturally viewed from a seemingly abstract algebraic context, namely the approximation of certain infinite-dimensional filtered Lie algebrasL by (finite-dimensional) graded nilpotent Lie algebrasg
x, org
(x,ζ), wherex ∈ M, (x, ζ) ∈ T* M/0. It requires the notion of ‘weak homomorphism’. A distinguishing feature of this approach is the intrinsic nature of the approximation process, in particular the minimality of the approximating Lie algebras. The process is closely linked to ‘localization’, associated to an appropriate module structure onL.The analysis of the approximating operators involves the unitary representation theory of the corresponding Lie groups. These representations are for the most part infinite-dimensional, and so involve a kind of ‘quantization’. Not all the representations enter. The filtered Lie algebraL leads to an ‘approximate Hamiltonian action’ ofG
(x,ζ), the group associated tog
(x,ζ), and thus induces (via an adaptation of a construction of Helffer and Nourrigat) an intrinsically defined ‘asymptotic momentmap’ with image ing
(x,ζ)
*. The relevant representations are those associated to this image by the Kirillov correspondence.The genesis of this work has been in the context of linear partial differential operators, in particular the question of hypoellipticity. For example, our framework leads to a natural hypoellipticity conjecture enlarging on that of Helffer and Nourrigat. We believe, however, that the approximation process is likely to have broader applicability, particularly in those contexts where the process can be extended to filtrations with anL
0term. This yields not simply a graded nilpotent algebra, but a semi-direct sum with a graded nilpotent. As we show, one such context arises in the approximation of nonlinear control systems.","Charles Rockland1,",Acta Applicandae Mathematica,1987,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00046716,"17B30,17B65,22E27,35H05,35S,93B"

A natural and closely related tool for the study of distance zeta functions is the class of “tube zeta
functions,” defined using the tube function of a fractal set. These three classes of zeta functions, under the name of “fractal zeta functions,” exhibit deep connections with Minkowski contents and upper box dimensions, as well as, more generally, with the complex dimensions of fractal sets. Further extensions include zeta functions of relative fractal drums, the box dimension of which can assume negative values, including minus infinity. We also survey some results concerning the existence of the meromorphic extensions of the spectral zeta functions of fractal drums, based in an essential way on earlier results of the first author on the spectral (or eigenvalue) asymptotics of fractal drums. It follows from these results that the associated spectral zeta function has a (nontrivial) meromorphic extension, and we use some of our results about fractal zeta functions to show the new fact according to which the upper bound obtained for the corresponding abscissa of meromorphic convergence is optimal.","Michel L.

826,Performance analysis of a water tank with oscillating walls for wave energy harvesting,"In this work we analyze the performance of a novel conceptual design for water-wave energy converters. The model system in question consists of a water tank with two hinged side walls that oscillate when the water surface within the tank is subjected to a temporally periodic, spatially distributed pressure variation. Then, through transmissions, the two oscillating walls are connected to electric generators. A linearized two-dimensional potential flow problem is formulated for this model system, and the steady periodic system response is solved for analytically. A comprehensive parameter study then is carried out so as to clarify how the system’s performance is affected by its design and operation parameters. It is found that, in addition to a series of resonant forcing frequencies that produce large electric power output, there also exist certain anti-resonant forcing frequencies that generate zero power. Moreover, with optimally tuned parameters, the maximized electric power output of the model system studied in this work is comparable with, and even higher than, that of preexisting systems of similar nominal size.","Po-Hsun Chen1 & Tian-Shiang Yang

With a combination of analytic and empirical results, we study the effects of fundamental parameters on convergence. We demonstrate that the preconditioned problem has an eigenvalue distribution consisting of a tightly clustered set together with a small number of outliers. The structure of these distributions is independent of the discretization mesh size, but the cardinality of the set of outliers increases slowly as the viscosity becomes smaller. These characteristics are directly correlated with the convergence properties of iterative solvers.","Howard C. Elman1, David J. Silvester2 & Andrew J.

828,An ontological analysis of medical Bayesian indicators of performance,"BackgroundBiomedical ontologies aim at providing the most exhaustive and rigorous representation of reality as described by biomedical sciences. A large part of medical reasoning deals with diagnosis and is essentially probabilistic. It would be an asset for biomedical ontologies to be able to support such a probabilistic reasoning and formalize Bayesian indicators of performance: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. In doing so, one has to consider that not only the positive and negative predictive values, but also sensitivity and specificity depend upon the group under consideration: this is the “spectrum effect”.MethodsThe sensitivity value of an index test IT for a disease M in a group g is identified with the proportion of people in g who have M who would get a positive result to IT if the test IT was realized on them. This value can be estimated by selecting a reference test RT for M and a sample s of g, and measuring the proportion, among members of s having a positive result to RT, of those who got a positive result to IT. Similar approximation strategies hold for prevalence, specificity, PPV and NPV. Indicators of diagnostic performances and their estimations are formalized in the context of the OBO Foundry, built on the realist upper ontology Basic Formal Ontology (BFO).ResultsEntities and relations from the Ontology for Biomedical investigations (OBI) and the Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) are used and complemented to represent reference tests and index tests, tests executions, tests results and the relations involving those entities, as well as the values of indicators of performance and their estimates. The computations taking as input several estimates of an indicator of performance to produce a finer estimate are also represented. The value of e.g. sensitivity estimates should be dissociated from the real sensitivity value – which involves possible, non-actual conditions, namely the result a person would get if a medical test would be performed on her. Such conditions could not be directly represented in a realist ontology, but a representation is proposed that introduces only actual entities by considering a disposition whose probability value is the real sensitivity value. A sensitivity estimate is a data item which is about such a disposition.ConclusionsThis model provides theoretical basis for the representation of entities supporting Bayesian reasoning in ontologies.","Adrien Barton1,5, Jean-François Ethier1,4,5, Régis Duvauferrier2,3 & …Anita Burgun",Journal of Biomedical Semantics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13326-016-0099-4,"Sensitivity,Specificity,Medical test,Spectrum effect,Disposition,Realist ontology,Informational entity"

The semigroup approach is adopted in investigation for the well-posedness of the closed loop system. We prove that the spectrum of the system is located in the left complex half-plane and its real part tends to − ∞ when the feedback gains satisfy some additional conditions. The asymptotic eigenvalues of the system is presented. By estimating the norm of the Riesz spectrum projection of the system operator that does not have the uniformly upper bound, we show that the eigenfunctions of the system do not form a basis in the state Hilbert space. Furthermore, the spectrum determined growth condition of the system is concluded and the exponential stability of the system is then established. Finally, numerical simulation is presented by applying the MATLAB software.","Dong-Xia Zhao1,2 & Jun-Min Wang",Journal of Dynamical and Control Systems,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10883-012-9143-6,"Pendulum system,delay feedbacks,spectrum,asymptotic analysis,stability,Riesz spectrum projection"

The result of this analysis is an optimal choice of the scaling parameter s which assures a bound on the backward error, i.e. the equivalence of the approximation with the exponential of a slightly perturbed matrix. Thanks to the SageMath package expbea we have developed, one can optimize the performance of the given polynomial approximation. On the other hand, we employ the package for the analysis of polynomials interpolating the exponential function at so called Leja–Hermite points. The resulting method for the action of the matrix exponential can be considered an extension of both Taylor series approximation and Leja point interpolation. We illustrate the behavior of the new approximation with several numerical examples.","Marco Caliari

833,The Teodorescu operator in Clifford analysis,"Euclidean Clifford analysis is a higher dimensional function theory centred around monogenic functions, i.e., null solutions to a first order vector valued rotation invariant differential operator \(\underset{\raise0.3em\hbox{$\smash{\scriptscriptstyle-}$}}{\partial }\) called the Dirac operator. More recently, Hermitian Clifford analysis has emerged as a new branch, offering yet a refinement of the Euclidean case; it focuses on the simultaneous null solutions, called Hermitian monogenic functions, to two Hermitian Dirac operators \(\partial _{\underset{\raise0.3em\hbox{$\smash{\scriptscriptstyle-}$}}{z} }\) and \(\partial _{\underset{\raise0.3em\hbox{$\smash{\scriptscriptstyle-}$}}{z} ^\dag }\) which are invariant under the action of the unitary group. In Euclidean Clifford analysis, the Teodorescu operator is the right inverse of the Dirac operator \(\underset{\raise0.3em\hbox{$\smash{\scriptscriptstyle-}$}}{\partial }\). In this paper, Teodorescu operators for the Hermitian Dirac operators \(\partial _{\underset{\raise0.3em\hbox{$\smash{\scriptscriptstyle-}$}}{z} }\) and \(\partial _{\underset{\raise0.3em\hbox{$\smash{\scriptscriptstyle-}$}}{z} ^\dag }\) are constructed. Moreover, the structure of the Euclidean and Hermitian Teodorescu operators is revealed by analyzing the more subtle behaviour of their components. Finally, the obtained inversion relations are still refined for the differential operators issuing from the Euclidean and Hermitian Dirac operators by splitting the Clifford algebra product into its dot and wedge parts. Their relationship with several complex variables theory is discussed.","F. Brackx1, H. De Schepper1, M. E. Luna-Elizarrarás2 & …M.

837,A Geometric Analysis of Phase Retrieval,"Can we recover a complex signal from its Fourier magnitudes? More generally, given a set of m measurements, \(y_k = \left| \varvec{a}_k^* \varvec{x} \right| \) for \(k = 1, \ldots , m\), is it possible to recover \(\varvec{x} \in \mathbb C^n\) (i.e., length-n complex vector)? This generalized phase retrieval (GPR) problem is a fundamental task in various disciplines and has been the subject of much recent investigation. Natural nonconvex heuristics often work remarkably well for GPR in practice, but lack clear theoretic explanations. In this paper, we take a step toward bridging this gap. We prove that when the measurement vectors \(\varvec{a}_k\)’s are generic (i.i.d. complex Gaussian) and numerous enough (\(m \ge C n \log ^3 n\)), with high probability, a natural least-squares formulation for GPR has the following benign geometric structure: (1) There are no spurious local minimizers, and all global minimizers are equal to the target signal \(\varvec{x}\), up to a global phase, and (2) the objective function has a negative directional curvature around each saddle point. This structure allows a number of iterative optimization methods to efficiently find a global minimizer, without special initialization. To corroborate the claim, we describe and analyze a second-order trust-region algorithm.","Ju Sun1, Qing Qu2 & John Wright",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-017-9365-9,"Phase retrieval,Nonconvex optimization,Function landscape,Second-order geometry,Ridable saddles,Trust-region method,Inverse problems,Mathematical imaging"

The solutions to the reduced systems are decomposed over subspaces of modes, which considerably improves the computational stability of the method and reduces the computational costs as compared with the usual decompositions over individual modes.

p-Adic Haar Multiresolution Analysis and Pseudo-Differential Operators","The notion of p-adic multiresolution analysis (MRA) is introduced. We discuss a “natural” refinement equation whose solution (a refinable function) is the characteristic function of the unit disc. This equation reflects the fact that the characteristic function of the unit disc is a sum of p characteristic functions of mutually disjoint discs of radius p
−1. This refinement equation generates a MRA. The case p=2 is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real Haar MRA. But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable function generating our Haar MRA is 1-periodic, which never holds for real refinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different 2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ℒ2(ℚ2) generated by the same Haar MRA. All of these new bases are described. We also constructed infinity many different multidimensional 2-adic Haar orthonormal wavelet bases for ℒ2(ℚ

) by means of the tensor product of one-dimensional MRAs. We also study connections between wavelet analysis and spectral analysis of pseudo-differential operators. A criterion for multidimensional p-adic wavelets to be eigenfunctions for a pseudo-differential operator (in the Lizorkin space) is derived. We proved also that these wavelets are eigenfunctions of the Taibleson multidimensional fractional operator. These facts create the necessary prerequisites for intensive using our wavelet bases in applications.

Denoted α and defined as the maximum of the real parts of the eigenvalues of a matrix X, it has many applications in stability analysis of dynamical systems. The function α is nonconvex and is non-Lipschitz near matrices with multiple eigenvalues. Variational analysis of this function was presented in Burke and Overton (Math Program 90:317–352, 2001), including a complete characterization of its regular subgradients and necessary conditions which must be satisfied by all its subgradients. A complete characterization of all subgradients of α at a matrix X was also given for the case that all active eigenvalues of X (those whose real part equals α(X)) are nonderogatory (their geometric multiplicity is one) and also for the case that they are all nondefective (their geometric multiplicity equals their algebraic multiplicity). However, necessary and sufficient conditions for all subgradients in all cases remain unknown.

of the irrational rotation of the circle, proved around 1905 independently

Their work pointed out the crucial role of continued fractions in uniform distribution
(for a good treatment of this, see e.g. the book of Drmota–Tichy [11]).
This quantitative theory immediately solves—via “discretization”—the problem
of quantitative equidistribution of the torus line flow in a square. Due to a simple
equivalence, the torus line also settles the case of all “integrable” flat dynamical
systems. In the last forty years a group of (mostly) ergodic theorists worked
out a qualitative theory of nonintegrable
flat systems (see Section 2.1). Using
a new nonergodic
approach that we call “shortline method”, here we start to

 In particular, we propose approaches for the robust sensitivity analysis of systems with uncertain parameters assumed to take values in a hyper-rectangle. We highlight vertex results, which allow us to check whether a property is satisfied for all parameter choices in the hyper-rectangle by simply checking whether it is satisfied for all parameter choices at the vertices of the hyper-rectangle. We show that, for a vast class of systems, including (bio)chemical reaction networks with mass-action kinetics, the system Jacobian has a totally multiaffine structure (namely, all minors of the Jacobian matrix are multiaffine functions of the uncertain parameters), which can be exploited to obtain several vertex results. We consider different problems: robust non-singularity; robust stability of the steady-state; robust steady-state sensitivity analysis, in the case of constant perturbations; robust frequency-response sensitivity analysis, in the presence of periodic perturbations; and robust adaptation analysis. The developed theory is then applied to gain insight into some examples of uncertain biochemical systems, including the incoherent feed-forward loop, the coherent feed-forward loop, the Brusselator oscillator and the Goldbeter oscillator.","Franco Blanchini1, Patrizio Colaneri2,3, Giulia Giordano

We suppose the Hamiltonian is analytic in a small neighborhood of the equilibrium position, and the characteristic exponents of the linearized system have zero real part, i.e., a nonlinear analysis is necessary to study the stability in the sense of Lyapunov. In general, the stability character of the equilibrium depends on nonzero terms of the lowest order N (N >2) in the Hamiltonian normal form, and the stability problem can be solved by using known criteria.We study the so-called degenerate cases, when terms of order higher than N must be taken into account to solve the stability problem. For such degenerate cases, we establish general conditions for stability and instability.

853,Quantum mechanics as a deterministic theory of a continuum of worlds,"A non-relativistic quantum mechanical theory is proposed that describes the universe as a continuum of worlds whose mutual interference gives rise to quantum phenomena. A logical framework is introduced to properly deal with propositions about objects in a multiplicity of worlds. In this logical framework, the continuum of worlds is treated in analogy to the continuum of time points; both “time” and “world” are considered as mutually independent modes of existence. The theory combines elements of Bohmian mechanics and of Everett’s many-worlds interpretation; it has a clear ontology and a set of precisely defined postulates from where the predictions of standard quantum mechanics can be derived. Probability as given by the Born rule emerges as a consequence of insufficient knowledge of observers about which world it is that they live in. The theory describes a continuum of worlds rather than a single world or a discrete set of worlds, so it is similar in spirit to many-worlds interpretations based on Everett’s approach, without being actually reducible to these. In particular, there is no splitting of worlds, which is a typical feature of Everett-type theories. Altogether, the theory explains (1) the subjective occurrence of probabilities, (2) their quantitative value as given by the Born rule, and (3) the apparently random “collapse of the wavefunction” caused by the measurement, while still being an objectively deterministic theory.","Kim Joris Boström

895,New approximations to the principal real-valued branch of the Lambert W-function,"The Lambert W-function is the solution to the transcendental equation W(x)e
W(x) = x. It has two real branches, one of which, for x ∈ [−1/e, ∞], is usually denoted as the principal branch. On this branch, the function grows from − 1 to infinity, logarithmically at large x. The present work is devoted to the construction of accurate approximations for the principal branch of the W-function. In particular, a simple, global analytic approximation is derived that covers the whole branch with a maximum relative error smaller than 5 × 10−3. Starting from it, machine precision accuracy is reached everywhere with only three steps of a quadratically convergent iterative scheme, here examined for the first time, which is more efficient than standard Newton’s iteration at large x. Analytic bounds for W are also constructed, for x > e, which are much tighter than those currently available. It is noted that the exponential of the upper bounding function yields an upper bound for the prime counting function π(n) that is better than the well-known Chebyshev’s estimates at large n. Finally, the construction of accurate approximations to W based on Chebyshev spectral theory is discussed; the difficulties involved are highlighted, and methods to overcome them are presented.","Roberto Iacono

By a linear stochastic transformation, the differential operator of the system is obtained. In order to evaluate the asymptotic expansion of the moment Lyapunov exponent, via a perturbation method, a ralevant eigenvalue problem is obtained. The eigenvalue problem is then solved by a Fourier cosine series expansion, and an infinite matrix is thus obtained, whose leading eigenvalue is the second-order of the asymptotic expansion of the moment Lyapunov exponent. Finally, the convergence of procedure is numerically illustrated, and the effects of the system and the noise parameters on the moment Lyapunov exponent are discussed.","Sheng-hong Li

905,Anisotropic Q-learning and waiting estimation based real-time routing for automated guided vehicles at container terminals,"Finding short and convenient routes for vehicles is an important issue on efficient operations of Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) systems at container terminals. This paper proposes an anisotropic Q-learning method for AGVs to find the shortest-time routes in the guide-path network of cross-lane type according to real-time vehicle states, which includes current and destination positions, heading direction and the number of vehicles at anisotropic four-direction neighboring locations. The vehicle waiting time of AGV systems is discussed and its estimation is suggested to improve the policy to select actions in the Q-learning method. An improved anisotropic Q-learning routing algorithm is developed with the vehicle-waiting-time-estimation based selecting-action policy. The parameter settings and performance of the proposed methods are analyzed based on simulations. The numerical experiments show that the improved anisotropic Q-learning method can provide stable and dynamic solutions for AGV routing, and achieve 9.5% improvement in optimization efficiency compared to the Jeon Learning Method (Jeon et al. in Logist Res 3(1):19–27, 2011).","Pengfei Zhou

906,"A New Constructive and Elementary Proof of a Bernstein–Walsh Theorem, Improved to Infinite Order Convergence, for Functions C∞ in an Intricate but Smooth Two-Dimensional Real Domain","We give a constructive proof that a C∞ function f(x, y) can be approximated by a polynomial with an infinite order rate of convergence on a general two-dimensional domain that is specified as the set where a smooth function B(x, y) is non-negative and which can be embedded within a rectangle. We explicitly construct a C∞ smoothed approximation to the characteristic function of the domain as \(\rho (x,y) \equiv \mathcal {H}([1 + SB(x,y)])\) where S > 0 is a constant, \(\mathcal {H}\) is a “ramp” (a smoothed approximation to the Heaviside step function) and ρ ≡ 1 on the domain Ω. The product f(x, y)ρ(x, y) is identically equal to f on the domain, but is of compact support. From this, we prove that ρf has a bivariate Chebyshev series on a rectangle that embeds Ω. We prove also that this expansion converges with increasing N, where N is the series truncation, faster than any finite inverse power of N, which is the definition of “infinite order” convergence. Bernstein–Walsh-type theorems have a long history, but the proofs use mathematical tools far removed from the education of the engineers and scientists. In contrast, our proof is constructive using tools accessible to applied practitioners. The proof of exponential convergence for functions with only C∞ smoothness has not been previously given by any methodology.","John P. Boyd

910,Octonionic Kerzman–Stein Operators,"In this paper we consider generalized Hardy spaces in the octonionic setting associated to arbitrary Lipschitz domains where the unit normal field exists almost everywhere. First we discuss some basic properties and explain structural differences to the associative Clifford analysis setting. The non-associativity requires special attention in the definition of an appropriate inner product and hence in the definition of a generalized Szegö projection. Whenever we want to apply classical theorems from reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces we first need to switch to the consideration of real-valued inner products where the Riesz representation theorem holds. Then we introduce a generalization of the dual Cauchy transform for octonionic monogenic functions which represents the adjoint transform with respect to the real-valued inner product \(\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle _0\) together with an associated octonionic Kerzman–Stein operator and related kernel functions. Also in the octonionic setting, the Kerzman–Stein operator that we introduce turns out to be a compact operator. A motivation behind this approach is to find an approximative method to compute the Szegö projection of octonionic monogenic functions offering a possibility to tackle BVP in the octonions without the explicit knowledge of the octonionic Szegö kernel which is extremely difficult to determine in general. We also discuss the particular cases of the octonionic unit ball and the half-space.

One confidence region sheath is about the expected no-failure trajectory; the other is about the Kalman estimate. If these two confidence regions of ellipsoidal cross section are disjoint at any time instant, a failure is declared.A test for two-ellipsoid overlap is developed which involves finding a single pointx* whose presence in both ellipsoids is necessary and sufficient for overlap. Thus, the overlap test is contorted into a search forx*, shown to be the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem that is easily solved once an associated scalar Lagrange multiplier is known. A successive approximations iteration equation for λ is obtained and is shown to converge as a contraction mapping. The method was developed to detect failures in an inertial navigation system that appear as uncompensated gyroscopic drift rate.

916,What can be observed in real time PCR and when does it show?,"Real time, or quantitative, PCR typically starts from a very low concentration of initial DNA strands. During iterations the numbers increase, first essentially by doubling, later predominantly in a linear way. Observation of the number of DNA molecules in the experiment becomes possible only when it is substantially larger than initial numbers, and then possibly affected by the randomness in individual replication. Can the initial copy number still be determined? This is a classical problem and, indeed, a concrete special case of the general problem of determining the number of ancestors, mutants or invaders, of a population observed only later. We approach it through a generalised version of the branching process model introduced in Jagers and Klebaner (J Theor Biol 224(3):299–304, 2003. doi:10.1016/S0022-5193(03)00166-8), and based on Michaelis–Menten type enzyme kinetical considerations from Schnell and Mendoza (J Theor Biol 184(4):433–440, 1997). A crucial role is played by the Michaelis–Menten constant being large, as compared to initial copy numbers. In a strange way, determination of the initial number turns out to be completely possible if the initial rate v is one, i.e all DNA strands replicate, but only partly so when \(v<1\), and thus the initial rate or probability of succesful replication is lower than one. Then, the starting molecule number becomes hidden behind a “veil of uncertainty”. This is a special case, of a hitherto unobserved general phenomenon in population growth processes, which will be adressed elsewhere.","Pavel Chigansky1, Peter Jagers

919,Einstein’s Investigations of Galilean Covariant Electrodynamics Prior to 1905,"Einstein learned from the magnet and conductor thought experiment how to use field transformation laws to extend the covariance of Maxwell’s electrodynamics. If he persisted in his use of this device, he would have found that the theory cleaves into two Galilean covariant parts, each with different field transformation laws. The tension between the two parts reflects a failure not mentioned by Einstein: that the relativity of motion manifested by observables in the magnet and conductor thought experiment does not extend to all observables in electrodynamics. An examination of Ritz’s work shows that Einstein’s early view could not have coincided with Ritz’s on an emission theory of light, but only with that of a conveniently reconstructed Ritz. One Ritz-like emission theory, attributed by Pauli to Ritz, proves to be a natural extension of the Galilean covariant part of Maxwell’s theory that happens also to accommodate the magnet and conductor thought experiment. Einstein’s famous chasing a light beam thought experiment fails as an objection to an ether-based, electrodynamical theory of light. However it would allow Einstein to formulate his general objections to all emission theories of light in a very sharp form. Einstein found two well known experimental results of 18th and 19th century optics compelling (Fizeau’s experiment, stellar aberration), while the accomplished Michelson-Morley experiment played no memorable role. I suggest they owe their importance to their providing a direct experimental grounding for Lorentz‘ local time, the precursor of Einstein’s relativity of simultaneity, and doing it essentially independently of electrodynamical theory. I attribute Einstein’s success to his determination to implement a principle of relativity in electrodynamics, but I urge that we not invest this stubbornness with any mystical prescience.",John D.

The estimate is obtained for the dimension of affine transformations group acting on such a surface.

In general (part of) this inverse problem has been (numerically) partially solved for hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces.In this paper we provide a family of real Riemann surfaces, in general non-hyperelliptic ones, which are described in terms of Fuchsian and Schottky uniformizations. The explicit relation between these two uniformizations is given. The Schottky uniformization is used to compute a suitable Riemann period matrix of the uniformized surface so that its coefficients are given in terms of the corresponding Schottky group.

On our smaller-scale applications, we apply the sum of squares (SOS) relaxation and solve the underlying problems with semidefinite programming. On the larger-scale or real-time applications, we use our recently introduced “SDSOS Optimization” techniques which result in second order cone programs.

927,Real-time optimisation of access control lists for efficient Internet packet filtering,"
This paper considers an optimisation problem encountered in the implementation of traffic policies on network routers, namely the ordering of rules in an access control list to minimise or reduce processing time and hence packet latency. The problem is formulated as an objective function with constraints and shown to be NP-complete by translation to a known problem. Exact and heuristic solution methods are introduced, discussed and compared and computational results given. The emphasis throughout is on practical implementation of the optimisation process, that is within the tight constraints of a production network router seeking to reduce latency, on-line, in real-time but without the overhead of significant extra computation.

We derive several optimality properties based on which we develop a computationally efficient algorithm for solving this admission control problem under certain conditions. Moreover, when no future task information is available, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which idling is optimal and define a metric for evaluating when and how long it is optimal to idle.

The proof is similar in spirit to an earlier analogous result for globally controllable systems; however, it resolves several technical obstructions that emerge when the assumption of small-time local controllability is substituted for that of global controllability. In the light of a recent characterisation of small-time local controllability for homogeneous control systems, the main result of the paper implies that, for a large class of control systems that appear in applications and the literature, there is a computable sufficient condition for stabilisability by means of a piecewise analytic feedback control.",Pantelis Isaiah,"Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems",2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00498-015-0148-z,"Small-time local controllability,State-feedback stabilisation,Piecewise analytic feedback control,Subanalytic sets"
932,Qualitative classification of singular points,"We study in this paper the qualitative classification of isolated singular points of analytic differential equations in the plane. Two singular points are said to be qualitatively equivalent if they are topologically equivalent and furthermore, two orbits start or end in the same direction at one singular point if and only if the equivalent two orbits start or end in the same direction at the other singular point. The degree of the leading terms in the Taylor expansion of a differential equation at a singular point will be called the degree of this singular point. The qualitative equivalence divides the set of singular points of degreem, into equivalence classes. The main problems studied here are the characterization of all qualitative equivalence classes and then, to determine to which class a singular point will belong to. We remark that up to now these problems have been solved only in the casem=1 before.The difficulty for this classification problem is that the number of blowing-ups necessary for the analysis of a singular point is unbounded (although it is finite) when this singular point varies in the set of singular points of degreem. To overcome this difficulty, we associate an oriented tree to the blowing-up process of any singular point such that each vertex represents some singular point. Then we prove that: (i) the above unboundedness comes exactly from the arbitrary length of an equidegree path; and (ii) the local phase portraits of the starting and the ending singular points in such a path are closely related by a simple rule which depends on the parity of the length of the path, but not on the length itself. Thus we obtain a successful method for this classification which can be applied in principle to the generalm-degree case.As application of our method, we get the precise list of qualitative equivalence classes of singular points of degree 2 (Theorem D). Further, we prove (Theorem F) that there are finitely many qualitative equivalence classes in the set of singular points of degreem, and there are a finite set of quantities, which are computed by a bounded number of operations, such that they determine to which class a given singular point belongs.As a by-product we obtain the topological classification of singular points of degree 2. A topological equivalence class is determined by the number of elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic sectors (denoted bye, h andp respectively) of the local phase portraits and their arrangement. The precise conditions for the tripe (e, h, p) have been given by Sagalovich. But this result is not sufficient for the topological classification problem. In fact, according to Sagalovich's theorem, there are 15 possible topological equivalence classes in the set of all singular points of degree 2; our result (Corollary E) shows that there are exactly 14 classes.",Qibao Jiang1 & Jaume Llibre,Qualitative Theory of Dynamical Systems,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02972669,"Singular points,blowing-up,local phase portrait"

948,Symmetric and strongly symmetric homeomorphisms on the real line with non-symmetric inversion,A quasisymmetric homeomorphism defines an element of the universal Teichmüller space and a symmetric one belongs to its little subspace. We show an example of a symmetric homeomorphism h of the real line \({\mathbb {R}}\) onto itself such that \(h^{-1}\) is not symmetric. This implies that the set of all symmetric self-homeomorphisms of \({\mathbb {R}}\) does not constitute a group under the composition. We also consider the same problem for a strongly symmetric self-homeomorphism of \({\mathbb {R}}\) which is defined by a certain concept of harmonic analysis. These results reveal the difference of the sets of such self-homeomorphisms of the real line from those of the unit circle.,"Huaying Wei1 & Katsuhiko Matsuzaki

949,Large-time behavior of solutions of parabolic equations on the real line with convergent initial data III: unstable limit at infinity,"This is a continuation, and conclusion, of our study of bounded solutions u of the semilinear parabolic equation \(u_t=u_{xx}+f(u)\) on the real line whose initial data \(u_0=u(\cdot ,0)\) have finite limits \(\theta ^\pm \) as \(x\rightarrow \pm \infty \). We assume that f is a locally Lipschitz function on \(\mathbb {R}\) satisfying minor nondegeneracy conditions. Our goal is to describe the asymptotic behavior of u(x, t) as \(t\rightarrow \infty \). In the first two parts of this series we mainly considered the cases where either \(\theta ^-\ne \theta ^+\); or \(\theta ^\pm =\theta _0\) and \(f(\theta _0)\ne 0\); or else \(\theta ^\pm =\theta _0\), \(f(\theta _0)=0\), and \(\theta _0\) is a stable equilibrium of the equation \({{\dot{\xi }}}=f(\xi )\). In all these cases we proved that the corresponding solution u is quasiconvergent—if bounded—which is to say that all limit profiles of \(u(\cdot ,t)\) as \(t\rightarrow \infty \) are steady states. The limit profiles, or accumulation points, are taken in \(L^\infty _{loc}(\mathbb {R})\). In the present paper, we take on the case that \(\theta ^\pm =\theta _0\), \(f(\theta _0)=0\), and \(\theta _0\) is an unstable equilibrium of the equation \({{\dot{\xi }}}=f(\xi )\). Our earlier quasiconvergence theorem in this case involved some restrictive technical conditions on the solution, which we now remove. Our sole condition on \(u(\cdot ,t)\) is that it is nonoscillatory (has only finitely many critical points) at some \(t\ge 0\). Since it is known that oscillatory bounded solutions are not always quasiconvergent, our result is nearly optimal.",Antoine Pauthier1 & Peter Poláčik,Partial Differential Equations and Applications,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42985-022-00187-y,"Parabolic equations on \(\mathbb {R}\)

The space \(L^2({\mathbb {R}}_+)\) of square integrable functions defined on the right half real line \({\mathbb {R}}_+\) models the causal signal space. This paper focuses on a class of dilation-and-modulation systems in \(L^2({\mathbb {R}}_+)\). The density theorem for Gabor systems in \(L^2(\mathbb {R})\) states a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of complete Gabor systems or Gabor frames in \(L^2({\mathbb {R}})\) in terms of the index set alone-independently of window functions. The space \(L^2({\mathbb {R}}_+)\) admits no nontrivial Gabor system since \({\mathbb {R}}_+\) is not a group according to the usual addition. In this paper, we introduce a class of dilation-and-modulation systems in \(L^2({\mathbb {R}}_+)\) and the notion of \(\Theta \)-transform matrix. Using the \(\Theta \)-transform matrix method we obtain the density theorem of the dilation-and-modulation systems in \(L^2({\mathbb {R}}_+)\) under the condition that \(\log _ba\) is a positive rational number, where a and b are the dilation and modulation parameters respectively. Precisely, we prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such a complete dilation-and-modulation system or dilation-and-modulation system frame in \(L^2({\mathbb {R}}_+)\) is that \(\log _ba \le 1\). Simultaneously, we obtain a \(\Theta \)-transform matrix-based expression of all complete dilation-and-modulation systems and all dilation-and-modulation system frames in \(L^2(\mathbb {R}_+)\).",Yun-Zhang Li1 & Ya-Hui Wang,Results in Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00025-019-1117-5,"42C40,42C15"
954,"Decomposing Arrangements of Hyperplanes: VC-Dimension, Combinatorial Dimension, and Point Location","This work is motivated by several basic problems and techniques that rely on space decomposition of arrangements of hyperplanes in high-dimensional spaces, most notably Meiser’s 1993 algorithm (Meiser in Inf Comput 106(2):286–303, 1993) for point location in such arrangements. A standard approach to these problems is via random sampling, in which one draws a random sample of the hyperplanes, constructs a suitable decomposition of its arrangement, and recurses within each cell of the decomposition with the subset of hyperplanes that cross the cell. The efficiency of the resulting algorithm depends on the quality of the sample, which is controlled by various parameters. One of these parameters is the classical VC-dimension, and its associated primal shatter dimension, of a suitably defined corresponding range space. Another parameter, which we refer to here as the combinatorial dimension, is the maximum number of hyperplanes that are needed to define a cell that can arise in the decomposition of some sample of the input hyperplanes; this parameter arises in Clarkson’s (and later Clarkson and Shor’s) random sampling technique. We re-examine these parameters for the two main space decomposition techniques—bottom-vertex triangulation, and vertical decomposition, including their explicit dependence on the dimension d, and discover several unexpected phenomena, which show that, in both techniques, there are large gaps between the VC-dimension (and primal shatter dimension), and the combinatorial dimension. Our main application is to point location in an arrangement of n hyperplanes is \(\mathbb {R}^d\), in which we show that the query cost in Meiser’s algorithm can be improved if one uses vertical decomposition instead of bottom-vertex triangulation, at the cost of some increase in the preprocessing cost and storage (which seem to be stated incorrectly, and are not worked out, in Meiser’s work). Our improved bounds rely on establishing several new structural properties and improved complexity bounds for vertical decomposition, which are of independent interest, and which we expect to find additional applications.","Esther Ezra

This topic in geometric measure theory has been extensively studied when s is an integer. In this paper, we focus on the non-integer case, building upon a series of papers on s-sets by Martín and Mattila from 1988 to 2000. When \(0<s<1\), we prove that measures with almost everywhere positive lower density and finite upper density are carried by countably many bi-Lipschitz curves. When \(1\le s<n\), we identify conditions on the lower density that ensure the measure is either carried by or singular to (1 / s)-Hölder curves.

Approximating the volume of a convex n-dimensional body, given by an oracle is one of the areas where this difference can be proved. In general, if we use a deterministic algorithm to approximate the volume, it requires exponentially many oracle questions in terms of n as n→∞. Dyer, Frieze and Kannan gave a randomized polynomial approximation algorithm for the volume of a convex body K⊆ℝn, given by a membership oracle.

961,Pattern formation in discrete cell lattices," In recent years, models for lattices of discrete cells have been attracting increased attention due to their greater flexibility to represent signalling and contact-dependent cell-cell interaction than conventional reaction-diffusion models.Using the almost forgotten method of Othmer and Scriven (1971) to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the Jacobian of the homogeneous state, a Turing-like linear stability analysis is carried out for diffusion-driven (DD) and signalling-driven (SD) discrete models. The method is a generalisation of the original method of Turing (1952). For two-species models it is found that there are profound differences between the two types of model when the size of the lattice increases. For DD models, the homogeneous state is typically either always stable, always unstable, or becomes unstable when the lattice gets suffficiently large. For SD models, the homogeneous state is typically unstable independent of lattice size, and stable only in a minor part of parameter space. Thus, SD models seem in general more pattern-prone than DD models.The conjecture that the linear analysis predicts the final pattern is investigated for a DD system with Thomas internal dynamics. Commonly the final pattern resembles the pattern of the initial perturbation of the homogeneous state, but this is by no means a general feature. When applied to a recent model for Delta-Notch lateral inhibition, linear analysis must be supplemented by various non-linear techniques to get a deeper insight into the patterning mechanisms. The overall conclusion is that a linear Turing analysis may be useful for predicting pattern, but when it comes to explaining patterns, non-linear analysis cannot be ignored.",Erik Plahte,Journal of Mathematical Biology,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002850100105,"Linear Stability,Lateral Inhibition,Linear Analysis,Homogeneous State,Linear Stability Analysis"

We obtain sufficient conditions for removability in geometric terms under the condition that K is contained in a generic C2 -submanifold M of co-dimension one in ∂Ω. The result uses information on the global geometry of the decomposition of a CR-manifold into CR-orbits, which may be of some independent interest. The minimal obstructions for removability contained in M are compact sets K of two kinds. Either K is the boundary of a complex variety of co-dimension one in Ω or it is an exceptional minimal CR-invariant subset of M, which is a certain analog of exceptional minimal sets in co-dimension one foliations. It is shown by an example that the latter possibility may occur as a nonremovable singularity set.Further examples show that the germ of envelopes of holomorphy of neighborhoods of ∞Ω K for K ⊂ M may be multisheeted.

","Abstract.  An approximation to the solution of a stochastic parabolic equation is constructed using the Galerkin approximation followed by the Wiener chaos decomposition. The result is applied to the nonlinear filtering problem for the time-homogeneous diffusion model with correlated noise. An algorithm is proposed for computing recursive approximations of the unnormalized filtering density and filter, and the errors of the approximations are estimated. Unlike most existing algorithms for nonlinear filtering, the real-time part of the algorithm does not require solving partial differential equations or evaluating integrals. The algorithm can be used for both continuous and discrete time observations.

Within this model, the influence of the heaviness of distribution tails on the effectiveness of egoistic and altruistic strategies in terms of maximizing two criteria, the average capital increment and the number of non-bankrupt participants, is investigated.

The goal of this paper is to develop some useful tools in nonlinear analysis by applying the best approximation approach for the classes of 1-set contractive set-valued mappings in p-vector spaces. In particular, we first develop general fixed point theorems of compact (single-valued) continuous mappings for closed p-convex subsets, which also provide an answer to Schauder’s conjecture of 1930s in the affirmative way under the setting of topological vector spaces for \(0 < p \leq 1\). Then one best approximation result for upper semicontinuous and 1-set contractive set-valued mappings is established, which is used as a useful tool to establish fixed points of nonself set-valued mappings with either inward or outward set conditions and related various boundary conditions under the framework of locally p-convex spaces for \(0 < p \leq 1\). In addition, based on the framework for the study of nonlinear analysis obtained for set-valued mappings with closed p-convex values in this paper, we conclude that development of nonlinear analysis and related tools for singe-valued mappings in locally p-convex spaces for \(0 < p \leq 1\) seems even more important, and can be done by the approach established in this paper.","George Xianzhi Yuan1,2,3,",Fixed Point Theory and Algorithms for Sciences and Engineering,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13663-022-00730-x,"47H04,47H10,46A16,46A55,49J27,49J35,52A07,54C60,54H25,55M20"

It is proved that the bilinear incidence can cause the backward bifurcation, where a locally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium co-exists with a locally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium when the basic reproduction number \((R_{0})\) is less than unity. It is shown that a sequence of Hopf bifurcations occur at the endemic equilibrium by choosing one parameter of the model as the bifurcation parameter. Meanwhile, the global asymptotic stabilities of the equilibria are established by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions under some conditions. Furthermore, the authors develop an extended model by incorporating with the intracellular delays and derive global asymptotic stability of the delayed model by constructing Lyapunov functions.

However, those cases where the fractional orders are different in the equations of FOEM (mixed order cases) have not been addressed before. This paper treats the analysis of some of these mixed order cases, proving boundedness of all the signals and convergence to zero of the mean value of the squared norm of the output error.

974,Analysis and application of ellipticity of stability equations on fluid mechanics,"By using characteristic analysis of the linear and nonlinear parabolic stability equations (PSE), PSE of primitive disturbance variables are proved to be parabolic intotal. By using sub-characteristic analysis of PSE, the linear PSE are proved to be elliptical and hyperbolic-parabolic for velocity U, in subsonic and supersonic, respectively; the nonlinear PSE are proved to be elliptical and hyperbolic-parabolic for relocity U+u in subsonic and supersonic, respectively. The methods are gained that the remained ellipticity is removed from the PSE by characteristic and sub-characteristic theories, the results for the linear PSE are consistent with the known results, and the influence of the Mach number is also given out. At the same time, the methods of removing the remained ellipticity are further obtained from the nonlinear PSE.","Li Ming-jun Associate Professor, Doctor1 & Gao Zhi",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02439657,"compressible fluid,parabolic stability equation,characteristic,sub-characteristic"
975,A hyperbolic model for convection-diffusion transport problems in CFD: Numerical analysis and applications,"In this paper we present a numerical study of the hyperbolic model for convection-diffusion transport problems that has been recently proposed by the authors [16]. This model avoids the infinite speed paradox, inherent to the standard parabolic model and introduces a new parameter τ called relaxation time. This parameter plays the role of an “inertia” for the movement of the pollutant.The analysis presented herein is twofold: first, we perform an accurate study of the 1D steady-state equations and its numerical solution. We compare the solution of the hyperbolic model with that of the parabolic model and we analyze the influence of the relaxation time on the solution. On the other hand, we explore the possibilities of the proposed model for real-world applications. With this aim we solve an example concerning the evolution of a pollutant being spilled in the harbor of A Coruña (northwest of Spain, EU).","H. Gómez1,2, I. Colominas2, F. Navarrina2 & …M.

977,Analysis and optimization of Lipschitz continuous mappings,"In this paper, four fundamental theorems for continuously differentiable mappings (the multiplier rule for equality constraints of Carathéodory, the inverse mapping theorem, the implicit mapping theorem, and the general multiplier rule for inequality and equality constraints of Mangasarian and Fromovitz) are shown to have natural extensions valid when the mappings are only Lipschitz continuous. Involved in these extensions is a compact, convex set of linear mappings called the generalized derivative, which can be assigned to any Lipschitz continuous mapping and point of its (open) domain and which reduces to the usual derivative whenever the mapping is continuously differentiable. After a brief calculus for this generalized derivative is presented in Part I, the connection between the ranks of the linear mappings in the generalized derivative and theinteriority of the given mapping is explored in Parts II and IV; this relationship is used in Parts III and IV to prove the extensions of the theorems mentioned above.",B.

980,The Concept of Relevance and the Logic Diagram Tradition,"What is logical relevance? Anderson and Belnap say that the “modern classical tradition [,] stemming from Frege and Whitehead-Russell, gave no consideration whatsoever to the classical notion of relevance.” But just what is this classical notion? I argue that the relevance tradition is implicitly most deeply concerned with the containment of truth-grounds, less deeply with the containment of classes, and least of all with variable sharing in the Anderson–Belnap manner. Thus modern classical logicians such as Peirce, Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, and Quine are implicit relevantists on the deepest level. In showing this, I reunite two fields of logic which, strangely from the traditional point of view, have become basically separated from each other: relevance logic and diagram logic. I argue that there are two main concepts of relevance, intensional and extensional. The first is that of the relevantists, who overlook the presence of the second in modern classical logic. The second is the concept of truth-ground containment as following from in Wittgenstein’s Tractatus. I show that this second concept belongs to the diagram tradition of showing that the premisses contain the conclusion by the fact that the conclusion is diagrammed in the very act of diagramming the premisses. I argue that the extensional concept is primary, with at least five usable modern classical filters or constraints and indefinitely many secondary intensional filters or constraints. For the extensional concept is the genus of deductive relevance, and the filters define species. Also following the Tractatus, deductive relevance, or full truth-ground containment, is the limit of inductive relevance, or partial truth-ground containment. Purely extensional inductive or partial relevance has its filters or species too. Thus extensional relevance is more properly a universal concept of relevance or summum genus with modern classical deductive logic, relevantist deductive logic, and inductive logic as its three main domains.",Jan Dejnožka,Logica Universalis,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11787-010-0014-1,"03A05,03B05,03B10,03B20,03B30,03B47,18A10,18A15"

982,Topological methods in moduli theory,"One of the main themes of this long article is the study of projective varieties which are K(H,1)’s, i.e. classifying spaces BH for some discrete group H. After recalling the basic properties of such classifying spaces, an important class of such varieties is introduced, the one of Bagnera–de Franchis varieties, the quotients of an Abelian variety by the free action of a cyclic group. Moduli spaces of Abelian varieties and of algebraic curves enter into the picture as examples of rational K(H,1)’s, through Teichmüller theory. The main trhust of the paper is to show how in the case of K(H,1)’s the study of moduli spaces and deformation classes can be achieved through by now classical results concerning regularity of classifying maps. The Inoue type varieties of Bauer and Catanese are introduced and studied as a key example, and new results are shown. Motivated from this study, the moduli spaces of algebraic varieties, and especially of algebraic curves with a group of automorphisms of a given topological type are studied in detail, following new results by the author, Michael Lönne and Fabio Perroni. Finally, the action of the absolute Galois group on the moduli spaces of such K(H,1) varieties is studied. In the case of surfaces isogenous to a product, it is shown how this yields a faifhtul action on the set of connected components of the moduli space: for each Galois automorphism of order different from 2 there is an algebraic surface S such that the Galois conjugate surface of S has fundamental group not isomorphic to the one of S.","F.

983,"Omnipresence, Multipresence and Ubiquity: Kinds of Generality in and Around Mathematics and Logics","A prized property of theories of all kinds is that of generality, of applicability or least relevance to a wide range of circumstances and situations. The purpose of this article is to present a pair of distinctions that suggest that three kinds of generality are to be found in mathematics and logics, not only at some particular period but especially in developments that take place over time: ‘omnipresent’ and ‘multipresent’ theories, and ‘ubiquitous’ notions that form dependent parts, or moments, of theories. The category of ‘facets’ is also introduced, primarily to assess the roles of diagrams and notations in these two disciplines. Various consequences are explored, starting with means of developing applied mathematics, and then reconsidering several established ways of elaborating or appraising theories, such as analogising, revolutions, abstraction, unification, reduction and axiomatisation. The influence of theories already in place upon theory-building is emphasised. The roles in both mathematics and logics of set theory, abstract algebras, metamathematics, and model theory are assessed, along with the different relationships between the two disciplines adopted in algebraic logic and in mathematical logic. Finally, the issue of monism versus pluralism in these two disciplines is rehearsed, and some suggestions are made about the special character of mathematical and logical knowledge, and also the differences between them. Since the article is basically an exercise in historiography, historical examples and case studies are described or noted throughout.","I.

Here we give one concrete example: Cayley-Dickson algebras admit the construction of direct analogues of so-called CM-lattices, in particular, lattices that are closed under multiplication.Canonical examples are lattices with components from the algebraic number fields \(\mathbb{Q}{[\sqrt{m1}, \ldots \sqrt{mk}]}\). Note that the multiplication of two non-integer lattice paravectors does not give anymore a lattice paravector in the Clifford algebra. In this paper we exploit the tools of octonionic function theory to set up an algebraic relation between different octonionic generalized elliptic functions which give rise to octonionic elliptic curves.

986,Experiments using interval analysis for solving a circuit design problem,"An already classical attempt at solving a circuit design problem leads to a system of 9 nonlinear equations in 9 variables. The sensitivity of the problem to small perturbations is extraordinarily high. Since 1974 several investigations have been made into this problem and they hint at one solution in the restricted domain of the nonnegative reals. The investigations did not give error estimates nor did they present conclusive evidence that the solution found is the only one in the domain of the nonnegative reals. Our paper reports on experimental computations which used various kinds of interval analytic methods while also sometimes reflecting on Wright-Cutteridge's philosophy and theses. The computations resulted in a guarantee that in the domain of consideration, that is, the interval [0,10] for each of the 9 variables, exactly one solution did exist, which was near the solution known up to now.

The generator of the process is defined by a diffusion elliptic differential operator in the space of square-integrable functions, subject to non-self-adjoint and non-local boundary conditions expressed through a probability measure on the domain. We obtain an expression for the difference between the resolvent of the operator and that of its Dirichlet realization. We prove that the numerical range is the whole complex plane, despite the fact that the spectrum is purely discrete and is contained in a half plane. Furthermore, for the class of absolutely continuous probability measures with square-integrable densities we characterize the adjoint operator and prove that the system of root vectors is complete. Finally, under certain assumptions on the densities, we obtain enclosures for the non-real spectrum and find a sufficient condition for the nonzero eigenvalue with the smallest real part to be real. The latter supports the conjecture of Ben-Ari and Pinsky that this eigenvalue is always real.","David Krejčiřík1, Vladimir Lotoreichik2, Konstantin Pankrashkin3 & …Matěj Tušek",Journal of Evolution Equations,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00028-020-00647-1,"Brownian motion,Elliptic differential operator,Non-self-adjoint and non-local boundary condition,Numerical range,Root vectors,Spectral enclosures"

A pump provides an axial pressure gradient which causes flow down the device. The outer cylinder is fixed and has ‘scrapers’ attached to it to cause flow mixing, whilst the inner cylinder rotates about its axis to provide shear and thus thin the fluid. The goal is to determine the optimal distribution of power between rotation and pumping. Although ostensibly the flow is nonlinear and three-dimensional we show that judicious use of fairly straightforward asymptotic methods can yield a great deal of information about the device, including cross-sectional flow predictions and throughput results. Furthermore, these results are derived for a variety of different flow conditions. Some numerical calculations are carried out using a commercial CFD code.

For all cases mentioned above, both for curves and functions, we obtain some analogues of the second fundamental theorem in Nevanlinna theory of meromorphic functions. At the end we discuss a new point-domain inequality dealing with finite point sets in an arbitrary domain.",Grigor A.

1006,Local instability and localization of attractors. From stochastic generator to Chua's systems,"This paper discusses the connection between various instability definitions (namely, Lyapunov instability, Poincaré or orbital instability, Zhukovskij instability) and chaotic movements. It is demonstrated that the notion of Zhukovskij instability is the most adequate for describing chaotic movements. In order to investigate this instability, a new type of linearization is offered and the connection between that and the theorems of Borg, Hartman-Olech, and Leonov is established. By means of new linearization, analytical conditions of the existence of strange attractors for impulse stochastic generators are obtained. The assumption is expressed that an analogous analytical tool may be elaborated for continuous dynamical systems describing Chua's circuits. The paper makes a first step in this direction and establishes a frequency criterion of the existence of positive invariant sets with positive Lebesgue measure for piecewise linear systems, which are unstable in every region of phase space where they are linear.","G.

1010,How and where do we live in virtual reality and cyberspace —Threats and Potentials,"With Virtual Reality and CyberSpace as latest computer-based developments approaching Mankind at a quickening pace, their dangerous and hallucinating perspectives are linked in this paper to a specific feature of computers: the incomprehensibility of their processesin principle. (This will be explained as resulting from the virtual, non-sensible nature of software as well as from the “incompatibility” of process structures on the hardware and operating system levels.) The question is asked whether, or how, an unprecedented threat of globally manipulating the human mind could be successfully faced. Starting with traditional Technology it is pointed out that in spite of damaging influences looming, and as a consequence of Man being exposed to Technology, quite positive inner capabilities have been developed or refined, such as an extended, inward form of the Sense of Touch or novel human qualities of trusting other persons in an organizational role that could be calledsuperpersonal in that it does not require to personally know the trusted person. While such was first the experience of technical experts these faculties have already, in the course of time, been acquired by all people, through general or school education. Specifically within Computer Technology a novel form of flexible, lively thinking is required, for coping with both scientific and engineering tasks. Also scientists and practitioners in Computer Technology are, through their professional activity, trained in a kind ofsuperpersonal sociality (and this will be used to explain why America is the center of software (and hardware) development).Again, and this time through Virtual Reality CyberSpace, the stage is set for Mankind to be generally and globally confronted with these issues. The key problem will be to not be drawn into unprecedented and horrifying illusions and addictions but to stand the enormous challenges from Virtual Reality, and to avoid an unparalleled deception. In a stepwise procedure it will be presented how eventually novel human faculties will be individually achieved, much beyond intellectual capacities and out of everybody's own strength and effort. On a larger historical scale, three different steps of modern Science Technology will be identified: Mechanical Technology, Electricity Electrical Engineering, Computer Technology, each of them sided by corresponding modern forms of Art: Painting Sculpture, Music, Eurythmy, respectively. The first phase was started in the 14th 15th century through Leonardo da Vinci, the father of modern Science and Technology as well as of modern Painting, the second phase was established through the second half of the 18th century, the third one came about during the first half of the 20th century. It will be made clear that, and how, Mankind is involved in a global and general education process during the past 500 years, aimed at developing higher or refined senses, or faculties of perception, following a learning procedure of finding and maintaining an inner equilibrium. The present and future perspectives will be addressed.",Horst F.

The proofs use generic absoluteness, that is, absoluteness under the required forcing extensions. We show that Solovay models are absolute under those forcing extensions, which yields, for instance, that in these models for every well ordered partition of \({\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}}\) there is a sequence of perfect sets whose product lies in one piece of the partition. Moreover, for every finite partition of \({[\mathbb{N}]^{\mathbb{N}} \times \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}}\) there is \({X \in [\mathbb{N}]^{\mathbb{N}}}\) and a sequence \({\{P_{k} : k \in \mathbb{N}\}}\) of perfect sets such that the product \({[X]^{\mathbb{N}} \times \prod_{k}^{\infty}P_{k}}\) lies in one piece of the partition, where \({[X]^{\mathbb{N}}}\) is the set of all infinite subsets of X.

Many interesting applications, interpretations, and connections arise from the geometric algebra based on these operations. Minkowski products with lines and circles are intimately related to problems of wavefront reflection or refraction in geometrical optics. The Minkowski algebra is also the natural extension, to complex numbers, of interval-arithmetic methods for monitoring propagation of errors or uncertainties in real-number computations. The Minkowski sums and products offer basic 'shape operators' for applications such as computer-aided design and mathematical morphology, and may also prove useful in other contexts where complex variables play a fundamental role – Fourier analysis, conformal mapping, stability of control systems, etc.","Rida T.

Restriction to choose only rational numbers is also imposed onS. Some games are completely solved, and in this caseS has a winning strategy iff his set includes a perfect subset, andD has a winning strategy iffS's set is at most denumerable.

Previously-known functions with this property have all been of four variables. We also improve on the state of the art for functions of four variables by constructing a function g for which g(A) has cardinality at least \(C|A|^2\); the previously best-achieved bound was \(C|A|^2/\log |A|\). Finally, we give an example of a five-variable function h for which h(A) has cardinality at least \(C|A|^4/\log |A|\). Proving these results depends only on the Szemerédi–Trotter incidence theorem and an analoguous result for planes due to Edelsbrunner, Guibas and Sharir, each applied in the Erlangen-type framework of Elekes and Sharir. In particular the proofs do not employ the Guth–Katz polynomial partitioning technique or the theory of ruled surfaces. Although the growth exponents for f, g and h are stronger than those for previously-considered functions, it is not clear that they are necessarily sharp. So we pose a question as to whether the bounds on the cardinalities of f(A), g(A) and h(A) can be further strengthened.",Timothy G. F.

In this paper, we give sufficient conditions to extend \(f\) as a holomorphic mapping across \(z_0\). In contrast with the equidimensional case, our result fails in general, when \(M'\) is Levi-degenerate at \(z_0'\). The proof uses the transversality of the mapping, which can be regarded as a type of Hopf’s lemma, the existence of points in \(M\) where the rank of the mapping is maximal; equal to \(n+1\) and the reflection principle in several variables.

This current situation exacerbated people’s restlessness and fear. Because of this pandemic, the world is travelling on a different path. This world has recovered from many disasters, but this is entirely a different situation. Today’s world is struggling in many ways to get rid of this disease. On the other hand, the number of people recovering from this disease gives us comfort. Yet, we have to take urgent precautionary measures to control this disease in all possible ways. Therefore, forecasting is one of the ways to take the necessary precautionary measures.

An algorithm for computing the current control ensuring a prescribed process is based on information produced by the author’s technique of synchronous weak noise exploration. This information can be measured in real time. Active control problems for nonstationary solutions of linear difference equations in a three-dimensional domain consisting of two subdomains are studied using the difference potential method. The shape of the domain and the boundary conditions may depend on time, while the coefficients may depend on time and spatial coordinates. If the difference problem is a mathematical model of sound propagation, the goal of control is to change the acoustic field in the given subdomains, for example, to shield the acoustic field in one subdomain from the undesirable influence (noise) of sources located in the other subdomain.",V.

1070,Real-time calculation of the current state estimates for a class of delay systems,The linear optimal observation problem is examined for one type of nonstationary delay system with an uncertainty in the initial state. A fast implementation of the dual method is proposed for calculating estimates of the initial state. This implementation is based on the quasi-reduction of the fundamental matrix of solutions to the mathematical model of delay systems. It is shown that an iteration step of the dual method only requires that auxiliary systems of ordinary differential equations be integrated on small time intervals. An algorithm is described for the real-time calculation of current state estimates. The results are illustrated by the optimal observation problem for a third-order stationary delay system.,"R.

1071,Real-valued non compactness measures in topological vector spaces and a pplications,"A non compactness measure with values in the lattice of extended non negative real numbers \([0, +\infty ]\) is introduced in the general setting of a Hausdorff topological vector space E. This generalizes the classical Kuratowski and Hausdorff non compactness measures. In order to achieve this, we introduce the notions of basic and sufficient collections of zero neighborhoods. We then show that our measure satisfies most of the properties of the classical non compactness measures. We particularly show that if E is locally p-convex for some \(0 < p \le 1\), our measure is stable by the transition to the closed p-convex hull. This allows us to obtain, as applications, generalizations of the well-known three fixed point theorems, namely Schauder, Darbo, and Sadovskii’s ones in the setting of locally p-convex spaces. As another application, we establish a quantification of Ascoli theorem in the space C(X, E) of vector-valued continuous functions on a Hausdorff completely regular space with values in a topological vector space E, giving an alternative of Ambrosetti theorem initially stated in the metric spaces setting.",Nabil Machrafi1 & Lahbib Oubbi,Banach Journal of Mathematical Analysis,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43037-020-00061-2,"Topological vector space,Non compactness measure,Precompact set,Completely regular space,Compact open topology,Ascoli theorem,Fixed point"
1072,Computing Interacting Multi-fronts in One Dimensional Real Ginzburg Landau Equations,"We develop an efficient and robust numerical scheme to compute multi-fronts in one-dimensional real Ginzburg–Landau equations that range from well-separated to strongly interacting and colliding. The scheme is based on the global centre-manifold reduction where one considers an initial sum of fronts plus a remainder function (not necessarily small) and applying a suitable projection based on the neutral eigenmodes of each front. Such a scheme efficiently captures the weakly interacting tails of the fronts. Furthermore, as the fronts become strongly interacting, we show how they may be added to the remainder function to accurately compute through collisions. We then present results of our numerical scheme applied to various real Ginzburg Landau equations where we observe colliding fronts, travelling fronts and fronts converging to bound states. Finally, we discuss how this numerical scheme can be extended to general PDE systems and other multi-localised structures.","Tasos Rossides1, David J. B.

1073,"Wilkinson’s Bus: Weak Condition Numbers, with an Application to Singular Polynomial Eigenproblems","We propose a new approach to the theory of conditioning for numerical analysis problems for which both classical and stochastic perturbation theories fail to predict the observed accuracy of computed solutions. To motivate our ideas, we present examples of problems that are discontinuous at a given input and even have infinite stochastic condition number, but where the solution is still computed to machine precision without relying on structured algorithms. Stimulated by the failure of classical and stochastic perturbation theory in capturing such phenomena, we define and analyse a weak worst-case and a weak stochastic condition number. This new theory is a more powerful predictor of the accuracy of computations than existing tools, especially when the worst-case and the expected sensitivity of a problem to perturbations of the input is not finite. We apply our analysis to the computation of simple eigenvalues of matrix polynomials, including the more difficult case of singular matrix polynomials. In addition, we show how the weak condition numbers can be estimated in practice.",Martin Lotz1 & Vanni Noferini,Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-020-09455-y,"Condition number,Stochastic perturbation theory,Weak condition number,Polynomial eigenvalue problem,Singular matrix polynomial"
1074,"Energy-efficient thermal-aware multiprocessor scheduling for
real-time tasks using TCPN","We present an energy-efficient thermal-aware real-time global scheduler
for a set of hard real-time (HRT) tasks running on a multiprocessor system. This
global scheduler fulfills the thermal and temporal constraints by handling two
independent variables, the task allocation time and the selection of clock
frequency. To achieve its goal, the proposed scheduler is split into two stages. An
off-line stage, based on a deadline partitioning scheme, computes the cycles that
the HRT tasks must run per deadline interval at the minimum clock frequency to save
energy while honoring the temporal and thermal constraints, and computes the maximum
frequency at which the system can run below the maximum temperature. Then, an
on-line, event-driven stage performs global task allocation applying a
Fixed-Priority Zero-Laxity policy, reducing the overhead of quantum-based or
interval-based global schedulers. The on-line stage embodies an adaptive scheduler
that accepts or rejects soft RT aperiodic tasks throttling CPU frequency to the
upper lowest available one to minimize power consumption while meeting time and
thermal constraints. This approach leverages the best of two worlds: the off-line
stage computes an ideal discrete HRT multiprocessor schedule, while the on-line
stage manage soft real-time aperiodic tasks with minimum power consumption and
maximum CPU utilization.","L. Rubio-Anguiano

In addition to developing the students’ intuition about the beautiful concepts of analysis, it is surely equally important to persuade them that precision and rigor are neither deterrents to intuition, nor ends in themselves, but the natural medium in which to formulate and think about mathematical questions.

In this paper, we consider this construction in the presence of infinitesimal symmetries of the two geometries. First, we prove that the submaximally symmetric c-projective model with type (1, 1) curvature is a submanifold of a submaximally symmetric quaternionic model and show how this fits into the construction. We give conditions for when the c-projective symmetries extend from the fixed-point set of the circle action to quaternionic symmetries, and we study the quaternionic symmetries of the Calabi and Eguchi–Hanson hyperkähler structures, showing that in some cases all quaternionic symmetries are obtained in this way.","Aleksandra Borówka1 & Henrik Winther

A reduced order model based on proper orthogonal decomposition is used to describe the temperature field.

1080,Interpreted synchronous extension of time Petri nets,"Our work is integrated into a global methodology to design synchronously executed embedded critical systems. It is used for the development of medical devices implanted into human body to perform functional electrical stimulation solutions (used in pacemakers, deep brain stimulation...). These systems are of course critical and real time, and the reliability of their behaviors must be guaranteed. These medical devices are implemented into a programmable logic circuit in a synchronous way, which allows efficient implementation (space, consumption and actual parallelism of tasks execution). This paper presents a solution that helps to prove that the behavior of the implemented system respects a set of properties, using Petri nets for modeling and analysis purposes. But one problem in formal methods is that the hardware target and the implementation strategy can have an influence on the execution of the system, but is usually not considered in the modeling and verification processes. Resolving this issue is the goal of this article. Our work has two main results: an operational one, and a theoretical one. First, we can now design critical controllers with hard safety or real time constraints, being sure the behavior is still guaranteed during the execution. Second, this work broadens the scope of expressivity and analyzability of Petri nets extensions. Until then, none managed in the same formalism, both for modeling and analysis, all the characteristics we have considered (weights on arcs, specific test and inhibitor arcs, interpretation, and time intervals, including the management of effective conflicts and the blocking of transitions).","Karen Godary-Dejean

The spinor geometric foundations of the paradigmatic Foucault spherical pendulum experiment of global-local contact holonomy exploit Hopf–Rinow type minimizing geodesic trajectories which appear as inertial traces designed by swing-planes on the terrestrial circular floor panel which is situated beneath the covariant motion of the oscillating pendulum device and where the linear traces are designing diameters of the spin structure induced Poincaré conformal hyperbolic open disc model.

The complexity of the algorithm, measured by the number of arithmetic operations in \(\hbox {D}\), is bounded by \(\big ( \sum _{i=1}^{m} D^{O ( \log ^{2} ( k ) )}_{i} +1 \big ) ( k^{\log ( k )} d )^{O ( k\log ^{2} ( k ))}\), where \(d= \deg ( P )\) and \(D_{i}\) is the degree of the real univariate representation describing the point \(p_{i}\). The best previous algorithm for this problem had complexity card \(( \mathcal {A} )^{O ( 1 )} d^{O ( k^{3/2} )}\) (Basu et al., ArXiv, 2012), where it is assumed that the degrees of the polynomials appearing in the representations of the points in \(\mathcal {A}\) are bounded by \(d^{O ( k )}\).

1093,Incidences Between Points and Lines on Two- and Three-Dimensional Varieties,"Let P be a set of m points and L a set of n lines in \({\mathbb {R}}^4,\) such that the points of P lie on an algebraic three-dimensional variety of degree \(D\) that does not contain hyperplane or quadric components (a quadric is an algebraic variety of degree two), and no 2-flat contains more than s lines of L. We show that the number of incidences between P and L is $$\begin{aligned} I(P,L) = O\bigl (m^{1/2}n^{1/2}D + m^{2/3}n^{1/3}s^{1/3} + nD + m\bigr ) \end{aligned}$$for some absolute constant of proportionality. This significantly improves the bound of the authors (Sharir, Solomon, Incidences between points and lines in \({\mathbb {R}}^4.\) Discrete Comput Geom 57(3), 702–756, 2017), for arbitrary sets of points and lines in \({\mathbb {R}}^4,\) when \(D\) is not too large. Moreover, when \(D\) and s are constant, we get a linear bound. The same bound holds when the three-dimensional surface is embedded in any higher-dimensional space. The bound extends (with a slight deterioration, when \(D\) is large) to the complex field too. For a complex three-dimensional variety, of degree \(D,\) embedded in \({\mathbb {C}}^4\) (or in any higher-dimensional \({\mathbb {C}}^d\)), under the same assumptions as above, we have $$\begin{aligned} I(P,L) = O\bigl (m^{1/2}n^{1/2}D + m^{2/3}n^{1/3}s^{1/3} + D^6 + nD + m \bigr ). \end{aligned}$$For the proof of these bounds, we revisit certain parts of [36], combined with the following new incidence bound, for which we present a direct and fairly simple proof. Going back to the real case, let P be a set of m points and L a set of n lines in \({\mathbb {R}}^d,\) for \(d\ge 3,\) which lie in a common two-dimensional algebraic surface of degree \(D\) that does not contain any 2-flat, so that no 2-flat contains more than s lines of L (here we require that the lines of L also be contained in the surface). Then the number of incidences between P and L is $$\begin{aligned} I(P,L) = O\bigl (m^{1/2}n^{1/2}D^{1/2} + m^{2/3}D^{2/3}s^{1/3} + m + n\bigr ). \end{aligned}$$When \(d=3,\) this improves the bound of Guth and Katz (On the Erdős distinct distances problem in the plane. Ann Math 181(1), 155–190, 2015) for this special case, when \(D\ll n^{1/2}.\) Moreover, the bound does not involve the term O(nD). This term arises in most standard approaches, and its removal is a significant aspect of our result. Again, the bound is linear when \(D= O(1).\) This bound too extends (with a slight deterioration, when \(D\) is large) to the complex field. For a complex two-dimensional variety, of degree \(D,\) when the ambient space is \({\mathbb {C}}^3\) (or any higher-dimensional \({\mathbb {C}}^d\)), under the same assumptions as above, we have $$\begin{aligned} I(P,L) = O\bigl (m^{1/2}n^{1/2}D^{1/2} + m^{2/3}D^{2/3}s^{1/3} + D^3 + m + n\bigr ). \end{aligned}$$These new incidence bounds are among the very few bounds, known so far, that hold over the complex field. The bound for two-dimensional (resp., three-dimensional) varieties coincides with the bound in the real case when \(D= O(m^{1/3})\) (resp., \(D= O(m^{1/6})\)).","Micha Sharir

This paper does not focus on resonance for endemic diseases but on resonance for emerging diseases. Periodicity can have an important impact on the initial growth rate and therefore on the epidemic threshold. Resonance occurs when the Euler–Lotka equation has a complex root with an imaginary part (i.e., a natural frequency) close to the angular frequency of the contact rate and a real part not too far from the Malthusian parameter. This is a kind of continuous-time analogue of work by Tuljapurkar on discrete-time population models, which in turn was motivated by the work by Coale on continuous-time demographic models with a periodic birth. We illustrate this resonance phenomenon on several simple epidemic models with contacts varying periodically on a weekly basis, and explain some surprising differences, e.g., between a periodic SEIR model with an exponentially distributed latency and the same model but with a fixed latency.",Nicolas Bacaër1 & Xamxinur Abdurahman,Journal of Mathematical Biology,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-008-0183-1,"Resonance,Epidemic threshold,SEIR model,Perturbation theory,Reproductive value"
1095,A Class of Pattern-Forming Models," A general class of nonlinear evolution equations is described, which support stable spatially oscillatory steady solutions. These equations are composed of an indefinite self-adjoint linear operator acting on the solution plus a nonlinear function, a typical example of the latter being a double-well potential. Thus a Lyapunov functional exists. The linear operator contains a parameter ρ  which could be interpreted as a measure of the pattern-forming tendency for the equation. Examples in this class of equations are an integrodifferential equation studied by Goldstein, Muraki, and Petrich and others in an activator-inhibitor context, and a class of fourth-order parabolic PDE's appearing in the literature in various physical connections and investigated rigorously by Coleman, Leizarowitz, Marcus, Mizel, Peletier, Troy, Zaslavskii, and others. The former example reduces to the real Ginzburg-Landau equation when ρ  = 0 . The most complete results, including threshold results for the appearance of globally minimizing patterns and many other properties of the patterns themselves, are given for complex-valued solutions in one space variable. A complete linear stability analysis for all such sinusoidal solutions is also given; it extends the set of stable solutions considerably beyond the global minimizers. Other results, including threshold results and the existence of large amplitude patterns as well as of bifurcating solutions, are provided for real-valued solutions; these results are relatively independent of the number of space variables. Finally, a slightly different class of evolution equations is given for which no patterned global minimizer exists, but a sequence of patterned solutions exist whose instabilities (if they are unstable) become ever weaker and the fineness of the oscillation becomes ever more pronounced.",P.

1096,Dimensional analysis in mathematical biology I. General discussion,Dimensional analysis is discussed from the viewpoint of its basic group properties and shown to be an algebraic Abelian group that is useful for analysis of physical measurements. The application of the method to various types of equations and the formulation of previously unclassified dimensions are discussed. Functional dimensional analysis is applied to the problems of cell size and biomass proliferation; future applications are also noted. A number of dimensionless terms have been formulated for cellular physiochemical phenomena. They apparently represent the first systematic study of biological dimensionless numbers recorded in the literature. A dimensionless proliferation law is suggested. A brief analysis of the physical dimensionality associated with information measures is carried out. Entropy and “information” are shown to be completely different in their dimensional meaning; other informational measures of possible interest in biology are proposed. The dimensional coding and computor analysis of biomathematical equations is suggested.,Walter R.

In this work, optimal control theory is used to propose optimal TB prevention and control strategy and rearrange the government TB budget for the best TB elimination plan. The impact of distancing, case finding, and/or case holding controls are investigated when the number of infected and infectious individuals are minimized, while the intervention costs are kept low. The implementation of optimal control measures shows that the distancing control, such as isolation of infectious people, early TB patient detection, and educational program/campaign for healthy control, is the most effective control factor for the prevention of TB transmission in South Korea.",Sunhwa Choi1 & Eunok Jung,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-014-9962-6,"Optimal control strategy,Tuberculosis model,Relapse, Government TB budget,Optimal control theory"

In the absence of topological obstructions, the holomorphic map may be chosen to have pointwise maximal rank. The analogous result holds for any compact Hausdorff family of maps, but it fails in general for a noncompact family.

1102,Shape Optimal Design Problem with Convective and Radiative Heat Transfer: Analysis and Implementation,"We present a study of an optimal design problem for a coupled system, governed by a steady-state potential flow equation and a thermal equation taking into account radiative phenomena with multiple reflections. The state equation is a nonlinear integro-differential system. We seek to minimize a cost function, depending on the temperature, with respect to the domain of the equations. First, we consider an optimal design problem in an abstract framework and, with the help of the classical adjoint state method, give an expression of the cost function differential. Then, we apply this result in the two-dimensional case to the nonlinear integro-differential system considered. We prove the differentiability of the cost function, introduce the adjoint state equation, and give an expression of its exact differential. Then, we discretize the equations by a finite-element method and use a gradient-type algorithm to decrease the cost function. We present numerical results as applied to the automotive industry.","D.

1103,Analysis of Schistosomiasis Global Dynamics with General Incidence Functions and Two Delays,"As most communicable diseases, schistosomiasis transmission mechanism involves some delay due to the incubation period. In this study, we seek to investigate the impact of incubation period on schistosomiasis global transmission dynamics. For that, starting from our previous work and using delay differential equations, we have proposed a more sophisticated model in which the new feature we accounted is the latency period in both human and snail hosts. Then, under some suitable assumptions, the mathematical analysis of the model has been done. Specifically, we calculated the basic reproduction number and showed its dependence on the delays in both humans and snails as follows: when the delays in humans and snails increase, \(\mathcal {R}_0\) decreases. We also proved that when \(\mathcal {R}_0<1\), the no-disease point is globally asymptotically stable and when \(\mathcal {R}_0>1\), the system is uniformly persistent and admits a unique endemic equilibrium. Besides, by formulating a suitable Lyapunov function, we established that the unique endemic steady state of the model is globally asymptotically stable when the threshold parameter \(\mathcal {R}_0\) exceeds 1. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis has been carried out to show how parameters variations affect the model global behaviour. We finished by illustrating some numerical results that are well in keeping with our theoretical findings.

1104,Cost efficiency measurement with price uncertainty: a data envelopment analysis,"Data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique is commonly utilized for efficiency assessment in a variety of fields for both theoretical and applicational purposes. In classic cost efficiency measurement models, the input and output data and input prices should be known for each decision-making unit (DMU). However, in real-life markets the input prices are not precisely defined for DMUs. In this paper, we shed light on the fact that fixed prices assumption cannot reflect the reality of situations, because market will force lower prices if greater amounts of a product are purchased. It can be said that discounts are automatically considered in these circumstances. To this end, an innovative idea is considered to modify the classic cost efficiency DEA model in order to investigate the situations of real-life markets. Then, by an empirical example, a comparison between the proposed approach and the classic cost efficiency model is provided.","F. Hosseinzadeh Lotfi1, A. Amirteimoori

1106,Cycle spaces of infinite dimensional flag domains,"Let G be a complex simple direct limit group, specifically \(SL(\infty ;\mathbb {C})\), \(SO(\infty ;\mathbb {C})\) or \(Sp(\infty ;\mathbb {C})\). Let \(\mathcal {F}\) be a (generalized) flag in \(\mathbb {C}^\infty \). If G is \(SO(\infty ;\mathbb {C})\) or \(Sp(\infty ;\mathbb {C})\) we suppose further that \(\mathcal {F}\) is isotropic. Let \(\mathcal {Z}\) denote the corresponding flag manifold; thus \(\mathcal {Z}= G/Q\) where Q is a parabolic subgroup of G. In a recent paper (Penkov and Wolf in Real group orbits on flag ind-varieties of \(SL_{\infty } ({\mathbb {C}})\), to appear in Proceedings in Mathematics and Statistics) we studied real forms \(G_0\) of G and properties of their orbits on \(\mathcal {Z}\). Here we concentrate on open \(G_0\)-orbits \(D \subset \mathcal {Z}\). When \(G_0\) is of hermitian type we work out the complete \(G_0\)-orbit structure of flag manifolds dual to the bounded symmetric domain for \(G_0\). Then we develop the structure of the corresponding cycle spaces \(\mathcal {M}_D\). Finally we study the real and quaternionic analogs of these theories.

1107,Coupling agent based simulation with dynamic networks analysis to study the emergence of mutual knowledge as a percolation phenomenon,The emergence of mutual knowledge is a major cognitive mechanism for the robustness of complex socio-technical systems. It has been extensively studied from an ethnomethodological point of view and empirically reproduced by multi-agent simulations. Whilst such simulations have been used to design real work settings the underlying theoretical grounding for the process is vague. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether the emergence of mutual knowledge (MK) in a group of colocated individuals can be explained as a percolation phenomenon. The followed methodology consists in coupling agent-based simulation with dynamic networks analysis to study information propagation phenomena: After using an agent-based simulation the authors generated and then analyzed its traces as networks where agents met and exchanged knowledge. Deep analysis of the resulting networks clearly shows that the emergence of MK is comparable to a percolation process. The authors specifically focus on how changes at the microscopic level in the proposed agent based simulator affect percolation and robustness. These results therefore provide theoretical basis for the analysis of social organizations.,"Julie Dugdale1,2, Narjès Bellamine Ben Saoud3, Fedia Zouai3 & …Bernard Pavard",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-016-4298-y,"Agent-based simulation,complex network dynamics,emergence,mutual knowledge,percolation,social networks"

When the Weyl symbol of such an operator is elliptic on the singular space, this space is always symplectic and we prove that the spectrum of the operator is discrete and can be described as in the case of global ellipticity.

The effect of relaxation time of viscoelastic materials on the variation curve between dimensionless flow velocity and the real part and imaginary part of dimensionless complex frequencies in the first-three-order modes were analyzed concretely. It is found that critical flow velocities of divergencee instability of Maxwell viscoelastic pipes conveying fluid with both ends simply supported decrease with the decrease of the relaxation time, while after the onset of divergence instability (buckling) critical flow velocities of coupled-mode flutter increase with the decrease of the relaxation time. Particularly, in the case of greater mass ratio, with the decrease of relaxation time, the onset of coupled-mode flutter delays, and even does not take place. When the relaxation time is greater than 103, stability behavior of viscoelastic pipes conveying fluid is almost similar to the elastic pipes conveying fluid.","Zhao Feng-qun1, Wang Zhong-min1, Feng Zhen-yu2 & …Liu Hong-zhao",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02435548,"viscoelastic pipe conveying fluid,stability,relaxation time,coupled-mode flutter"
1118,2D-3D registration for 3D analysis of lower limb alignment in a weight-bearing condition,"X-ray imaging is the conventional method for diagnosing the orthopedic condition of a patient. Computerized Tomography(CT) scanning is another diagnostic method that provides patient’s 3D anatomical information. However, both methods have limitations when diagnosing the whole leg; X-ray imaging does not provide 3D information, and normal CT scanning cannot be performed with a standing posture. Obtaining 3D data regarding the whole leg in a standing posture is clinically important because it enables 3D analysis in the weight bearing condition. Based on these clinical needs, a hardware-based bi-plane X-ray imaging system has been developed; it uses two orthogonal X-ray images. However, such methods have not been made available in general clinics because of the hight cost. Therefore, we proposed a widely adaptive method for 2D X-ray image and 3D CT scan data. By this method, it is possible to threedimensionally analyze the whole leg in standing posture. The optimal position that generates the most similar image is the captured X-ray image. The algorithm verifies the similarity using the performance of the proposed method by simulation-based experiments. Then, we analyzed the internal-external rotation angle of the femur using real patient data. Approximately 10.55 degrees of internal rotations were found relative to the defined anterior-posterior direction. In this paper, we present a useful registration method using the conventional X-ray image and 3D CT scan data to analyze the whole leg in the weight-bearing condition.","Eungjune Shim1,2, Youngjun Kim1,2, Deukhee Lee1,2, Byung Hoon Lee3, Sungkyung Woo4 & …Kunwoo Lee",Applied Mathematics-A Journal of Chinese Universities,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11766-018-3459-2,"2D-3D registration,3D analysis,X-ray,CT,simulated annealing"

The core is made from functionally graded (FG) material that has heterogeneous power-law distribution through the radial coordinate. It is assumed that the core is subjected to a magnetic field whereas the core is covered by two insulated composite layers. To determine the exact solution, first characteristic equations are derived for different material types in a polar coordinate system, namely, magneto-elastic, elastic, and electro-elastic for the FG, orthotropic, and piezoelectric materials, respectively. The displacement-based method is used instead of the stress-based method to derive a set of closed-form real-valued solutions for both real and complex roots. Based on the elasticity theory, exact solutions for the governing equations are determined layer-by-layer that are considerably more accurate than typical simplified theories. The accuracy of the presented method is compared and validated with the available literature and the finite element simulation.

1123,Idempotent Functional Analysis: An Algebraic Approach,"This paper is devoted to Idempotent Functional Analysis, which is an “abstract” version of Idempotent Analysis developed by V. P. Maslov and his collaborators. We give a brief survey of the basic ideas of Idempotent Analysis. The correspondence between concepts and theorems of traditional Functional Analysis and its idempotent version is discussed in the spirit of N. Bohr's correspondence principle in quantum theory. We present an algebraic approach to Idempotent Functional Analysis. Basic notions and results are formulated in algebraic terms; the essential point is that the operation of idempotent addition can be defined for arbitrary infinite sets of summands. We study idempotent analogs of the basic principles of linear functional analysis and results on the general form of a linear functional and scalar products in idempotent spaces.","G. L.

\(\varepsilon \rightarrow 0.\) Though the solutions of the programming problems are real, we consider the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality system as a one-dimensional complex algebraic variety in a multi-dimensional complex space. We use the Buchberger’s elimination algorithm of the Gröbner bases theory to replace the defining equations of the variety by its Gröbner basis, that has the property that one of its elements is bivariate, that is, a polynomial in
\(\varepsilon\) and one of the decision variables only. Changing the elimination order in the Buchberger’s algorithm, we obtain such a bivariate polynomial for each of the decision variables. Thus, the solutions of the original system reduces to a number of algebraic functions in
\(\varepsilon\) that can be represented as a Puiseux series in
\(\varepsilon\) a neighbourhood of
\(\varepsilon = 0\). A detailed analysis of the branching order and the order of the pole is also provided.

1128,Local convergence analysis of tensor methods for nonlinear equations,"Tensor methods for nonlinear equations base each iteration upon a standard linear model, augmented by a low rank quadratic term that is selected in such a way that the mode is efficient to form, store, and solve. These methods have been shown to be very efficient and robust computationally, especially on problems where the Jacobian matrix at the root has a small rank deficiency. This paper analyzes the local convergence properties of two versions of tensor methods, on problems where the Jacobian matrix at the root has a null space of rank one. Both methods augment the standard linear model by a rank one quadratic term. We show under mild conditions that the sequence of iterates generated by the tensor method based upon an “ideal” tensor model converges locally and two-step Q-superlinearly to the solution with Q-order 3/2, and that the sequence of iterates generated by the tensor method based upon a practial tensor model converges locally and three-step Q-superlinearly to the solution with Q-order 3/2. In the same situation, it is known that standard methods converge linearly with constant converging to 1/2. Hence, tensor methods have theoretical advantages over standard methods. Our analysis also confirms that tensor methods converge at least quadratically on problems where the Jacobian matrix at the root is nonsingular.","Dan Feng1, Paul D. Frank2 & Robert B.

However, few detailed analysis has been done to explain the fluctuation in energy intensity during 2002–2005. In this paper, we use the structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to decompose energy intensity into five determining factors: Energy input coefficient, technology coefficient (Leontief inverse coefficient), final demands structure by product, final demands by category and final energy consumption coefficient. We then further decompose two coefficients, energy input coefficient and technology coefficient, into structure and real coefficient. Empirical study is carried out based on the energy-input-output tables from 1987 to 2005 in 2000 constant price. The results show that between 1987 and 2002, energy input structure accounts for most of the decline in energy intensity. However, the input structure and final demands structure by product explain the increase of the energy intensity between 2002 and 2005.","Yan Xia1,2, Cuihong Yang1 & Xikang Chen",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-012-9061-4,"Energy intensity,input-output technology,RAS method,structural decomposition analysis"

In this paper we give a detailed search space analysis of available benchmark instance classes that have been used in various researches. The large fitness-distance correlations observed for many of these instances suggest that adaptive restart algorithms like iterated local search or memetic algorithms, which iteratively generate new starting solutions for a local search based on previous search experience, are promising candidates for obtaining high performing algorithms.

1133,A Riemannian manifold analysis of endothelial cell monolayer impedance parameter precision,"Endothelial cell adhesion and barrier function play a critical role in many biological and pathophysiological processes. The decomposition of endothelial cell adhesion and barrier function into cell–cell and cell–matrix components using frequency dependent cellular micro-impedance measurements has, therefore, received widespread application. Few if any studies, however, have examined the precision of these model parameters. This study presents a parameter sensitivity analysis of a representative cellular barrier function model using a concise geometric formulation that includes instrumental data acquisition settings. Both model state dependence and instrumental noise distributions are accounted for within the framework of Riemannian manifold theory. Experimentally acquired microimpedance measurements of attached endothelial cells define the model state domain, while experimentally measured noise statistics define the data space Riemannian metric based on the Fisher information matrix. The results of this analysis show that the sensitivity of cell–cell and cell–matrix impedance components are highly model state dependent and several well defined regions of low precision exist. The results of this study further indicate that membrane resistive components can significantly reduce the precision of the remaining parameters in these models.","Anthony E. English1, Conrad P.

We focus mostly on applications of the super-relaxed ()-proximal point algorithm to the context of solving a class of nonlinear variational inclusion problems, based on the notion of maximal ()-monotonicity. Investigations highlighted in this communication are greatly influenced by the celebrated work of Rockafellar (1976), while others have played a significant part as well in generalizing the proximal point algorithm considered by Rockafellar (1976) to the case of the relaxed proximal point algorithm by Eckstein and Bertsekas (1992). Even for the linear convergence analysis for the overrelaxed (or super-relaxed) ()-proximal point algorithm, the fundamental model for Rockafellar's case does the job.

There are two fundamental biological differences between the Turing conditions on fixed and growing domains, namely: (i) we need not enforce cross nor pure kinetic conditions and (ii) the restriction to activator-inhibitor kinetics to induce pattern formation on a growing biological system is no longer a requirement. Our theoretical findings are confirmed and reinforced by numerical simulations for the special cases of isotropic linear, exponential and logistic growth profiles. In particular we illustrate an example of a reaction-diffusion system which cannot exhibit a diffusively-driven instability on a fixed domain but is unstable in the presence of slow growth.","Anotida Madzvamuse1, Eamonn A.

1137,Convergence rates of the Heavy-Ball method under the Łojasiewicz property,"In this paper, a joint study of the behavior of solutions of the Heavy Ball ODE and Heavy Ball type algorithms is given. Since the pioneering work of Polyak (USSR Comput Math Math Phys 4(5):1–17, 1964), it is well known that such a scheme is very efficient for \(C^2\) strongly convex functions with Lipschitz gradient. But much less is known when only growth conditions are considered. Depending on the geometry of the function to minimize, convergence rates for convex functions, with some additional regularity such as quasi-strong convexity, or strong convexity, were recently obtained in Aujol et al. (Convergence rates of the Heavy-Ball method for quasi-strongly convex optimization, 2020). Convergence results with much weaker assumptions are given in the present paper: namely, linear convergence rates when assuming a growth condition (which amounts to a Łojasiewicz property in the convex case). This analysis is firstly performed in continuous time for the ODE, and then transposed for discrete optimization schemes. In particular, a variant of the Heavy Ball algorithm is proposed, which converges geometrically whatever the parameters choice, and which has the best state of the art convergence rate for first order methods to minimize composite non smooth convex functions satisfying a Łojasiewicz property.

Remarkably, \(\hbox {PIP}_3\) shows both transient patterns and oscillatory patterns on the membrane, depending on experimental conditions (Arai et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci 107:12399–12404, 2010). Here, we analyzed a reaction–diffusion model of the phosphatidylinositol signaling system that gives rise to transient pattern formation. Numerical bifurcation analysis showed that equilibrium solutions can be classified into uniform, unimodal and bimodal ones, among which the first and the second are stable for some parameter regions. We found that transient patterns of \(\hbox {PIP}_3\) can be explained by the “ghost” after unimodal solutions disappear at a fold bifurcation. We further reduced the original PDEs to five-variable ODEs, considering only local and global concentrations. The bifurcation analysis of the reduced ODEs supports the above observation. Finally, we propose that trajectories of such transient patterns are determined by the phase space structure of the dynamical system.","Naotoshi Nakamura1 & Tatsuo Shibata

First by using an our own approach we investigated some properties of eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenfunctions. Then, for self-adjoint realization of the problem under consideration we define a different inner product in the classical Hilbert space in which we treated an operator-theoretic formulation.

The higher the type of the approximating function is, the higher the rate of approximation near segment ends can be made, compared with their inner points. The general approximation scale, which is nonuniform over its segments, depending on the type of the entire function, is similar to the scale set out for the first time in the study of the approximation of the function by polynomials. For cases with one segment and its approximation by polynomials, this scale has allowed us to connect the so-called direct theorems, which state a possible rate of smooth function approximation by polynomials, and the inverse theorems, which give the smoothness of a function approximated by polynomials at a given rate. The approximations by entire functions on a countable unit of segments for the case of Hölder spaces have been studied by the authors in two preceding papers.

1211,Approximations by entire functions on countable unions of segments of the real axis,"The problem to approximate functions continuous on subsets of the real line by entire functions has a long history that started from the Jackson–Bernstein theorem on the approximation of 2- periodic functions by trigonometric polynomials naturally treated as exponential-type entire functions. In this paper, we deal with the problem referring to the concept of this theorem describing classes of functional spaces via the rate of their possible approximation by entire functions. A key example is the Bernstein theorem describing the class of bounded functions from Holder classes over the whole axis by exponential-type entire functions. The key point is that the approximation rate at a neighborhood of the segment edge exceeds the one that originally appeared in the theory of approximation functions from Holder classes on segments (this allows us to coordinate the direct and inverse theorems for that case, i.e., to recover the holder smoothness from the approximation rate in the said scale). In the present paper, we present a direct theorem on the possibility of a prescribed-rate approximation of functions from Holder classes on countable unions of segments by entire functions. Earlier, such approximations were not considered. Also, we provide general definitions and important lemmas used for further constructing approximating functions. In the second part of the work, we provide a proof of the direct theorem. In our further papers, to obtain a constructive description of the smoothness class by means of the approximation rate, we will prove the corresponding inverse theorem. Usually, to deduce such assertions, one needs a fact similar to the Bernstein theorem on the estimate of the norm of an entire function via the norm of the function itself. In our case, we need an assertion similar to the Akhiezer–Levin theorem estimating an entire function on the axis via its values on a subset of the axis.",O. V. Silvanovich1 & N. A.

With increasing complexity and vividness in the network analysis problems, there is a need to modify the existing traditional centrality measures. Weighted centrality measures usually consider weights on the edges and assume the weights on the nodes to be uniform. One of the main reasons for this assumption is the hardness and challenges in mapping the nodes to their corresponding weights. In this paper, we propose a way to overcome this kind of limitation by hybridization of the traditional centrality measures. The hybridization is done by taking one of the centrality measures as a mapping function to generate weights on the nodes and then using the node weights in other centrality measures for better complex ranking.","Anuj Singh1, Rishi Ranjan Singh1 & S.

The RF structure gives the potential for achieving novel and expressive curved three-dimensional complex forms, using straight members. At the same time, it offers the possibility for fast and simple construction using low-tech techniques and simple joints.

We model this case as a variation of the Team Orienteering Problem (TOP), constraining all vehicle routes to an upper time, or distance, limit, and taking into account the limited capacity of the fleet vehicles. The problem requires an effective solution in almost real time. We propose a new heuristic to provide efficient solutions within this strict computational time constraint. To test the quality of the heuristic, we have developed and validated a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that obtains high quality (but computationally expensive) solutions. The solutions of the heuristic compare favorably to those obtained by the GA. The latter has also been tested successfully in a real-time fleet management system.","I. Minis1, K. Mamasis1 & V.

This can be considered as a further step in the original Shub–Smale program of studying the real zeros of random polynomial systems. Our technique is general, and it also applies, for example, to the case of the enumerative geometry of flats on complete intersections. We derive a formula expressing the average number \(E_n\) of real lines on a random hypersurface of degree \(2n-3\) in \({\mathbb {R}}{\text {P}}^n\) in terms of the expected modulus of the determinant of a special random matrix. In the case \(n=3\) we prove that the average number of real lines on a random cubic surface in \({\mathbb {R}}{\text {P}}^3\) equals: $$\begin{aligned} E_3=6\sqrt{2}-3. \end{aligned}$$This technique can also be applied to express the number \(C_n\) of complex lines on a generic hypersurface of degree \(2n-3\) in \({\mathbb {C}}{\text {P}}^n\) in terms of the expectation of the square of the modulus of the determinant of a random Hermitian matrix. As a special case, we recover the classical statement \(C_3=27\). We determine, at the logarithmic scale, the asymptotic of the quantity \(E_n\), by relating it to \(C_n\) (whose asymptotic has been recently computed in [19]). Specifically we prove that: $$\begin{aligned} \lim _{n\rightarrow \infty }\frac{\log E_n}{\log C_n}=\frac{1}{2}. \end{aligned}$$Finally we show that this approach can be used to compute the number \(R_n=(2n-3)!!\) of real lines, counted with their intrinsic signs (as defined in [28]), on a generic real hypersurface of degree \(2n-3\) in \({\mathbb {R}}{\text {P}}^n\).","Saugata Basu1, Antonio Lerario2, Erik Lundberg3 & …Chris Peterson",Mathematische Annalen,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00208-019-01837-0,"14N15,14P05,14N10,60G60"

For a generalized Brockett cost function we present a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for local minimum.

1 on Ω(G) is compatible with τ (in the sense of Duistermaat). This allows us to formulate and prove a version of Duistermaat’s convexity theorem. Namely, the images of Ω(G) and Ω(G)τ (fixed point set of τ) under the T × S
1 moment map on Ω(G) are equal. The space Ω(G)τ is homotopy equivalent to the loop space Ω(G/K) of the Riemannian symmetric space G/K. We prove a stronger form of a result of Bott and Samelson which relates the cohomology rings with coefficients in \( {\mathbb{Z}_2} \) of Ω(G) and Ω(G/K). Namely, the two cohomology rings are isomorphic, by a degree-halving isomorphism (Bott and Samelson [BS] had proved that the Betti numbers are equal).

This solution expression is referred to our exact nonreflecting boundary condition and leads us to reformulate the original infinite discrete system into an equivalent finite discrete system. Meanwhile, the trapezoidal quadrature rule is introduced to discretize the contour integral involved in exact boundary conditions.

Our main contribution is to provide algorithms that do not use linear programming, are simple and much faster than the corresponding ones proposed in Bar-Noy et al. (ibid., 1999), while either having the same quality of approximation or improving it. More precisely, compared to the results of in Bar-Noy et al. (ibid., 1999), our pseudo-polynomial algorithm for multiple unrelated machines and all of our strongly-polynomial algorithms have better performance ratios, all of our algorithms run much faster, are combinatorial in nature and avoid linear programming. Finally, we show that algorithms with better performance ratios than 2 are possible if the stretch factors of the jobs are bounded; a straightforward consequence of this result is an improvement of the ratio of an optimal solution of the integer programming formulation of the JISP2 problem (see Spieksma, Journal of Scheduling, vol. 2, pp. 215–227, 1999) to its linear programming relaxation.",Piotr Berman1 & Bhaskar Dasgupta,Journal of Combinatorial Optimization,2000,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1009822211065,"real-time scheduling,throughput maximization,approximation algorithms"

Here \(\mathrm{Diff }_{1}(\mathbb R)\) denotes the extension of the group of all compactly supported, rapidly decreasing, or \(W^{\infty ,1}\)-diffeomorphisms, which allows for a shift toward infinity. Surprisingly, on the non-extended group the Levi-Civita connection does not exist. In particular, this result provides an analytic solution formula for the corresponding geodesic equation, the non-periodic Hunter–Saxton (HS) equation. In addition, we show that one can obtain a similar result for the two-component HS equation and discuss the case of the non-homogeneous Sobolev one metric, which is related to the Camassa–Holm equation.","Martin Bauer1, Martins Bruveris2 & Peter W.

However, the present paper deciphers to solve multi-objective signomial programming problems by consolidating \(\epsilon \)-constraint method with the geometric programming (GP) technique. The GP technique is used to address posynomial (problems with positive coefficients) nonlinear programming problems whereas signomial programming is a generalization of geometric programming in which the coefficients are not necessarily positive. This technique can be used in several fields of engineering analysis, aircraft design, finance, etc. A numerical example of a multi-objective signomial programming problem is stated to prove the proposed technique.",Sudipta Mishra1 & Rashmi Ranjan Ota,International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40819-022-01416-z,"Geometric programming,Posynomial,Optimization,Signomial programming,

1263,“The True” in Gottlob Frege's “Über die Grundlagen der Geometrie”,"In this essay, I examine the metaphysical and metalogical ramifications of Gottlob Frege's controversy with David Hilbert and Alwin Korselt, over Hilbert's
Grundlagen der Geometrie. These ramifications include(1) Korselt's original appeals to general metatheoretic Deutungen (interpretations);(2) Hilbert's puzzling belief that whatever is consistent in some sense ‘exists;’ and(3) Frege's ‘semantic monist’ conviction that theoretical sense and reference (mathematical and other) ‘must’ be “eindeutig lösbar” (“uniquely solvable”).My principal conclusions are(4) that Frege's position in (3) represented a pervasively dogmatic presumption that his newly discovered quantification theory ‘must’ have a propositional metatheory (‘the True’; ‘the False’); and(5) that this needless assumption adversely affected not only his polemic against the moderate semantic relativism of Hilbert and Korselt, but also his reception of type-theoretic ideas, and greatly facilitated his vulnerability to the sort of self-referential inconsistency Russell discovered in Grundgesetz V.These conclusions also seem to me to provide a conceptual framework for several of Frege's other arguments and reactions which might seem more particular and disparate. These include(6) his arbitrary restrictions on the range of second-order quantification, which undercut his own tentative attempts to give accounts of independence and semantic consequence;(7) his uncharacteristic hesitation, even dismay, at the prospect that such accounts might eventuate in a genuinely quantificational metamathematics, whose Gegenstände (objects) might themselves be Gedanken (thoughts); and, perhaps most revealingly(8) his otherwise quite enigmatic, quasi-stoic doctrine that ‘genuine’ formal deduction ‘must’ be from premises that are ‘true.’A deep reluctance to pluralize or iterate ‘the’ transition from theory to meta-theory would also be consonant, of course, with Frege's vigorous insistence that there can be only one level each of linguistic Begriffe (concepts) and Gegenstände (objects). With hindsight, such an assumption may seem more gratuitous in the philosophy of language (where it contributed, I would argue, to Wittgenstein's famous transition to ‘the mystical’ in 6.45 and 6.522 of the Tractatus); but its more implausible implications in this wider context seemed to emerge more slowly.In the mathematical test-case discussed here, however, such strains were immediately and painfully apparent; the first models of hyperbolic geometry were described some thirty years before Frege drafted his polemic against Hilbert's pioneering exposition. It is my hope that a careful study of Frege's lines of argument in this relatively straightforward mathematical controversy may suggest other, parallel approaches to the richer and more ambiguous problems of his philosophy of language.",William Boos,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,1985,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00329904,"Conceptual Framework,Quantification Theory,Careful Study,Undercut,Semantic Relativism"

Thus, as has previously been obtained by Mandelbrot, it is the closure of the image of a subordinator —one that is identified explicitly. Well-known facts about subordinators give Shepp's necessary and sufficient condition on μ for complete coverage and, when the coverage is not complete, a formula for the Hausdorff dimension of the uncovered set.

1270,"Complexified Hermitian Symmetric Spaces, Hyperkähler Structures, and Real Group Actions","There is a known hyperkähler structure on any complexified Hermitian symmetric space G/K, whose construction relies on identifying G/K with both a (co)adjoint orbit and the cotangent bundle to the compact Hermitian symmetric space Gu/K0. Via a family of explicit diffeomorphisms, we show that almost all of the complex structures are equivalent to the one on G/K; via a family of related diffeomorphisms, we show that almost all of the symplectic structures are equivalent to the one on \(T^{*}\left (G_{u}/K_{0}\right )\). We highlight the intermediate Kähler structures, which share a holomorphic action of G related to the one on G/K, but moment geometry related to that of \(T^{*}\left (G_{u}/K_{0}\right )\). As an application, for the real form G0 ⊂ G corresponding to G0/K0, the Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type, we give a strategy for study of the action on G/K using the moment-critical subsets for the intermediate structures.

1272,Geometric configurations of singularities for quadratic differential systems with three distinct real simple finite singularities,"In this work we classify, with respect to the geometric equivalence relation, the global configurations of singularities, finite and infinite, of quadratic differential systems possessing exactly three distinct finite simple singularities. This relation is finer than the topological equivalence relation which does not distinguish between a focus and a node or between a strong and a weak focus or between foci (or saddles) of different orders. Such distinctions are, however, important in the production of limit cycles close to the foci (or loops) in perturbations of the systems. The notion of geometric equivalence relation of configurations of singularities allows us to incorporate all these important geometric features which can be expressed in purely algebraic terms. The geometric classification of all configurations of singularities, finite and infinite, of quadratic systems was initiated in a work published in 2013 when the classification was done for systems with total multiplicity m

f
 of finite singularities less than or equal to one. That work was continued in an article which is due to appear in 2014 where the geometric classification of configurations of singularities was done for the case m

f
 = 2. In this article we go one step further and obtain the geometric classification of singularities, finite and infinite, for the subclass mentioned above. We obtain 147 geometrically distinct configurations of singularities for this family. We give here the global bifurcation diagram of configurations of singularities, both finite and infinite, with respect to the geometric equivalence relation, for this class of systems. The bifurcation set of this diagram is algebraic. The bifurcation diagram is done in the 12-dimensional space of parameters and it is expressed in terms of polynomial invariants, a fact which gives us an algorithm for determining the geometric configuration of singularities for any quadratic system in this particular class.","Joan C.

In this paper, we present an analytic method, which is based on a combinatorial optimization approach in order to calculate global integer extrema of a real-valued box-constrained multivariate quadratic function, whereby this problem will be proven to be as NP-hard via solving it by a Travelling Salesman instance. Instead, we solve it using eigenvalue theory, which allows us to calculate the eigenvalues of an arbitrary symmetric matrix using Newton’s method, which converges quadratically and in addition yields a Jordan normal form with \(1 \times 1\)-blocks, from which a special representation of the multivariate quadratic function based on affine linear functions can be derived. Finally, global integer minimizers can be calculated dynamically and efficiently most often in a small amount of time using the Fourier–Motzkin- and a Branch and Bound like Dijkstra-algorithm.

We classify critical surfaces of a real polynomial f into three classes: repeated, intersected and primal critical surfaces. These different critical surfaces are defined by some essential factors of f, where an essential factor of f means a polynomial factor of f–c
0, for some constant c
0. We show that the degree sum of repeated critical surfaces is at most d–1, where d is the degree of f. When a real polynomial f has only two variables, we give the minimum upper bound for the number of other isolated critical points even when there are nondegenerate critical curves, and the minimum upper bound of isolated local extrema even when there are saddle curves. We show that a normal polynomial has no odd degree essential factors, and all of its even degree essential factors are normal polynomials, up to a sign change. We show that if a normal quartic polynomial f has a normal quadratic essential factor, a global minimum of f can be either easily found, or located within the interior(s) of one or two ellipsoids. We also show that a normal quartic polynomial can have at most one local maximum.",Liqun Qi,Journal of Global Optimization,2004,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-004-6875-1,"critical surface,extrema,extrema surface,normal polynomial,polynomial,quadratic polynomial,quartic polynomial,tensor"
1281,Solving the minimum toll revenue problem in real transportation networks,"As a means to relieve traffic congestion, toll pricing has recently received significant attention by transportation planners. Inappropriate use of transportation networks is one of the major causes of network congestion. Toll pricing is a method of traffic management in which traffic flow is guided to proper time and path in order to reduce the total delay in the network. This article investigates a method for solving the minimum toll revenue problem in real and large-scale transportation networks. The objective of this problem is to find link tolls that simultaneously cause users to efficiently use the transportation network and to minimize the total toll revenues to be collected. Although this model is linear, excessive number of variables and constraints make it very difficult to solve for large-scale networks. In this paper, a path-generation algorithm is proposed for solving the model. Implementation of this algorithm for different networks indicates that this method can achieve the optimal solution after a few iterations and a proper CPU time.",Mohammadali Shirazi1 & Hedayat Z.

To describe investor’s different decision behaviors, we characterize the return rates on securities by LR fuzzy numbers with different shape parameters in the left- and right-hand reference functions.

We define an appropriate covering projection \(\widetilde{M}\rightarrow M\) such that the pullback of b has a primitive \(\widetilde{B}\) and prove that the operator is globally solvable if and only if the superlevel and sublevel sets of \(\widetilde{B}\) are connected. As a byproduct we obtain a new geometric characterization for the global hypoellipticity of the operator. When M is orientable we prove a connection between the global solvability of \({\mathbb {L}}\) and that of \({\mathbb {L}}^{n-1}\) which is the last non-trivial operator of the complex, in particular, we prove that \({\mathbb {L}}\) is globally solvable if and only if \({\mathbb {L}}^{n-1}\) is globally solvable. In the smooth category, we are able to provide analogous geometric characterizations of the global solvability and the global hypoellipticity when b is a Morse 1-form, i.e., when the structure is of Mizohata type.","Jorge Hounie

Then f is C-coarsely M-Lipschitz in the quasihyperbolic metric. These are generalizations of the corresponding result obtained recently by Väisälä.",Man Zi Huang1 & Xian Tao Wang,"Acta Mathematica Sinica, English Series",2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10114-011-8672-3,"Uniform domain,QH ψ-uniform domain,inner uniform domain,QH inner ψ-uniform domain,convex domain,quasihyperbolic geodesic,neargeodesic,quasiconvexity,real Banach space"

We say that f is positive definite if the kernel \(f\big (\frac{x + y}{2}\big )\) is positive definite. We call f negative definite if, for every \(h > 0\), the function \(e^{-hf}\) is positive definite. Our first main result is a Lévy–Khintchine formula (an integral representation) for negative definite functions on arbitrary intervals. For \((a,b) = (0,\infty )\) it generalizes classical results by Bernstein and Horn. On a symmetric interval \((-a,a)\), we call f reflection positive if it is positive definite and, in addition, the kernel \(f\big (\frac{x - y}{2}\big )\) is positive definite. We likewise define reflection negative functions and obtain a Lévy–Khintchine formula for reflection negative functions on all of \({{\mathbb {R}}}\).

By a new characterization of weighted Hölder spaces and Zvonkin’s transformation we prove some new a priori estimates, and therefore establish the global well-posedness for singular HJB equations. As applications, we obtain global well-posedness in polynomial weighted Hölder spaces for KPZ type equations on the real line, as well as modified KPZ equations for which the Cole–Hopf transformation is not applicable.

1315,On the scheduling of real world multiproduct pipelines with simultaneous delivery,"Common carrier pipelines are the best suited mode for transporting large volumes of petroleum products from production areas to long-distance terminals. In such pipelines, batches of refined petroleum products are pumped back-to-back, without any physical barrier separating them. The problem addressed in this paper deals with the scheduling of a real world multi-product, single source pipeline system that must supply the products to several offtake terminals. Most contributions on the scheduling of single-source multiproduct pipeline operations deal with the sequence deliveries in distribution terminals i.e., at any time only one terminal is connected to the pipeline. Practically, pipeline operators usually carry out simultaneous deliveries to multiple terminals to cut down the number of pipeline stoppages and pump switchings so as to reduce the energy consumed for resuming flow in idle pipeline segments, and the pump maintenance costs. This paper introduces a novel continuous mathematical approach, mixed integer linear programming to solve the short-term operational planning by allowing the execution of simultaneous deliveries to multiple receiving terminals during a pumping operation. Contrarily to previous continuous approaches that perform the pipeline input/output operations in two hierarchical stages, the new formulation aims to find both of them in a single step. The objective of this work is to find the optimal sequence of input and output operations that satisfy terminal requirements at minimum total costs. As compared to previous works, significantly improvement in solution quality has been achieved. Especially, the proposed formulation leads to better utilization of the pipeline capacity, and consequently, a substantial reduction in the amount of required time for satisfying all of the specified product deliveries, i.e., the pipeline running time. The main results are presented.",Alireza Ghaffari-Hadigheh1 & Hossein Mostafaei,Optimization and Engineering,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-014-9263-9,"Scheduling,Petroleum products,Multiproduct pipeline,Simultaneous deliveries"
1316,Non universality for the variance of the number of real roots of random trigonometric polynomials,"In this article, we consider the following family of random trigonometric polynomials \(p_n(t,Y)=\sum _{k=1}^n Y_{k}^1 \cos (kt)+Y_{k}^2\sin (kt)\) for a given sequence of i.i.d. random variables \(Y^i_{k}\), \(i\in \{1,2\}\), \(k\ge 1\), which are centered and standardized. We set \({\mathcal {N}}([0,\pi ],Y)\) the number of real roots over \([0,\pi ]\) and \({\mathcal {N}}([0,\pi ],G)\) the corresponding quantity when the coefficients follow a standard Gaussian distribution. We prove under a Doeblin’s condition on the distribution of the coefficients that $$\begin{aligned} \lim _{n\rightarrow \infty }\frac{\text {Var}\left( {\mathcal {N}}_n([0,\pi ],Y)\right) }{n} =\lim _{n\rightarrow \infty }\frac{\text {Var}\left( {\mathcal {N}}_n([0,\pi ],G)\right) }{n} +\frac{1}{30}\left( {\mathbb {E}}\left( \left( Y_{1}^1\right) ^4\right) -3\right) . \end{aligned}$$The latter establishes that the behavior of the variance is not universal and depends on the distribution of the underlying coefficients through their kurtosis. Actually, a more general result is proven in this article, which does not require that the coefficients are identically distributed. The proof mixes a recent result regarding Edgeworth expansions for distribution norms established in Bally et al. (Electron J Probab 23(45):1–51, 2018) with the celebrated Kac–Rice formula.","Vlad Bally1, Lucia Caramellino2 & Guillaume Poly",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-018-0869-2,"Random trigonometric polynomials,Edgeworth expansion for non smooth functions,Kac–Rice formula,Small balls estimates"
1317,An inertial extrapolation method for solving generalized split feasibility problems in real hilbert spaces,"In this paper, we propose a new inertial extrapolation method for solving a certain class of generalized split feasibility problems in two real Hilbert spaces. We prove that the proposed method converges strongly to a minimum norm solution of the problem when the underlying operator is pseudomonotone and uniformly continuous which are much more weaker assumptions than the inverse strongly monotonicity assumptions used in the literature. Moreover, our method uses stepsizes that are generated at each iteration by some simple computations, which allows it to be easily implemented without the prior knowledge of the operator norm or the coefficient of a underlying operator. Furthermore, some examples and numerical experiments to show the efficiency and implementation of our method (in comparison with other methods in the literature) were also discussed in the framework of infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces.","E.

In an appendix, we provide a self-contained proof of a new result which is relevant to the differentiation of integrals, a topic which, as witnessed in Stein’s work, and especially by the aforementioned book, has deep connections with the boundary behavior of harmonic and holomorphic functions.","Fausto Di Biase

We say \(\mathcal {R}\) is field-type if it satisfies the former condition. In this paper, we prove a more general result for arbitrary expansions of \((\mathbb {R},<,+)\). In particular, we show that for expansions that do not define dense \(\omega \)-orders (we call these type A expansions), an appropriate version of Zilber’s principle holds.

Such functions arise naturally as the transfer functions of numerous infinite-dimensional control systems, including examples specified by PDEs. Our results include characterizations of positive realness in terms of imaginary axis conditions, as well as characterizations in terms of stabilizing output feedback, where both static and dynamic output feedback are considered. In particular, it is shown that stabilizability by all static output feedback operators belonging to a sector can be characterized in terms of a natural positive-real condition and, furthermore, we derive a characterization of positive realness in terms of a mixture of imaginary axis and stabilization conditions. Finally, we introduce concepts of strict and strong positive realness, prove results which relate these notions and analyse the relationship between the strong positive realness property and stabilization by feedback. The theory is illustrated by examples, some arising from controlled and observed partial differential equations.","C. Guiver

The emergence appears to have been, from the very start, both transdisciplinary (function theory, calculus of variations, differential geometry) and international, although the AMS-Göttingen connection played a specific part. First used as an expository and didactic tool (e.g. by Osgood), it soon played a crucial part in the creation of new mathematical concepts (e.g. in Hahn’s work), in the shaping of research agendas (e.g. Blaschke’s global differential geometry), and in Weyl’s axiomatic foundation of the manifold concept.

1332,History of the Lenz–Ising Model 1950–1965: from irrelevance to relevance,"This is the second in a series of three papers that charts the history of the Lenz–Ising model (commonly called just the Ising model in the physics literature) in considerable detail, from its invention in the early 1920s to its recognition as an important tool in the study of phase transitions by the late 1960s. By focusing on the development in physicists’ perception of the model’s ability to yield physical insight—in contrast to the more technical perspective in previous historical accounts, for example, Brush (Rev Modern Phys 39: 883–893, 1967) and Hoddeson et al. (Out of the Crystal Maze. Chapters from the History of Solid-State Physics. Oxford University Press, New York, pp. 489–616, 1992)—the series aims to cover and explain in depth why this model went from relative obscurity to a prominent position in modern physics, and to examine the consequences of this change. In the present paper, which is self-contained, I deal with the development from the early 1950s to the 1960s and document that this period witnessed a major change in the perception of the model: In the 1950s it was not in the cards that the model was to become a pivotal tool of theoretical physics in the following decade. In fact, I show, based upon recollections and research papers, that many of the physicists in the 1950s interested in understanding phase transitions saw the model as irrelevant for this endeavor because it oversimplifies the nature of the microscopic constituents of the physical systems exhibiting phase transitions. However, one group, Cyril Domb’s in London, held a more positive view during this decade. To bring out the basis for their view, I analyze in detail their motivation and work. In the last part of the paper I document that the model was seen as much more physically relevant in the early 1960s and examine the development that led to this change in perception. I argue that the main factor behind the change was the realization of the surprising and striking agreement between aspects of the model, notably its critical behavior, and empirical features of the physical phenomena.",Martin Niss,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-008-0039-5,"Phase Transition,Ising Model,Physical Review,Critical Behavior,Critical Phenomenon"

1339,From Problems to Structures: the Cousin Problems and the Emergence of the Sheaf Concept,"Historical work on the emergence of sheaf theory has mainly concentrated on the topological origins of sheaf cohomology in the period from 1945 to 1950 and on subsequent developments. However, a shift of emphasis both in time-scale and disciplinary context can help gain new insight into the emergence of the sheaf concept. This paper concentrates on Henri Cartan’s work in the theory of analytic functions of several complex variables and the strikingly different roles it played at two stages of the emergence of sheaf theory: the definition of a new structure and formulation of a new research programme in 1940–1944; the unexpected integration into sheaf cohomology in 1951–1952. In order to bring this two-stage structural transition into perspective, we will concentrate more specifically on a family of problems, the so-called Cousin problems, from Poincaré (1883) to Cartan. This medium-term narrative provides insight into two more general issues in the history of contemporary mathematics. First, we will focus on the use of problems in theory-making. Second, the history of the design of structures in geometrically flavoured contexts—such as for the sheaf and fibre-bundle structures—which will help provide a more comprehensive view of the structuralist moment, a moment whose algebraic component has so far been the main focus for historical work.",Renaud Chorlay,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-009-0052-3,"Holomorphic Function,Meromorphic Function,Open Covering,Cohomology Theory,Stein Manifold"

This method of proof allows to treat the case where the workload distribution has a mass at discontinuities off and where the formula of Konstantopoulos and Zazanis [1992] has to be modified.

The continuity conditions for the traction and displacement along the interface in the physical plane are reduced to the similar conditions along the unit circle of the mapping plane. The properties of the complex potentials defined in the finite elliptic region are analyzed. From the continuity conditions, one can separate and obtain the relevant complex potentials defined in the inclusion and the matrix. From the obtained complex potentials, the dependence of the real strains and stresses in the inclusion from the assumed eigenstrains is evaluated. In addition, the stress distribution on the interface along the matrix side is evaluated. The results are obtained in the paper for the first time.","Yi-zhou Chen

1349,A methodological basis for description and analysis of systems with complex switch-like interactions," A wide range of complex systems appear to have switch-like interactions, i.e. below (or above) a certain threshold x has no or little influence on y, while above (or below) this threshold the effect of x on y saturates rapidly to a constant level. Switching functions are frequently described by sigmoid functions or combinations of these. Within the context of ordinary differential equations we present a very general methodological basis for designing and analysing models involving complicated switching functions together with any other non-linearities. A procedure to determine position and stability properties of all stationary points lying close to a threshold for one or several variables, so-called singular stationary points, is developed. Such points may represent homeostatic states in models, and are therefore of considerable interest. The analysis provides a profound insight into the generic effects of steep sigmoid interactions on the dynamics around homeostatic points. It leads to qualitative as well as quantitative predictions without using advanced mathematical methods. Thus, it may have an important heuristic function in connection with numerical simulations aimed at unfolding the predictive potential of realistic models.","Erik Plahte1, Thomas Mestl1 & Stig W.

1350,The education of Walter Kohn and the creation of density functional theory,"The theoretical solid-state physicist Walter Kohn was awarded one-half of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his mid-1960s creation of an approach to the many-particle problem in quantum mechanics called density functional theory (DFT). In its exact form, DFT establishes that the total charge density of any system of electrons and nuclei provides all the information needed for a complete description of that system. This was a breakthrough for the study of atoms, molecules, gases, liquids, and solids. Before DFT, it was thought that knowledge of the vastly more complicated many-electron wave function was essential for a complete description of such systems. Today, 50 years after its introduction, DFT (in one of its approximate forms) is the method of choice used by most scientists to calculate the physical properties of materials of all kinds. In this paper, I present a biographical essay of Kohn’s educational experiences and professional career up to and including the creation of DFT. My account begins with Kohn’s student years in Austria, England, and Canada during World War II and continues with his graduate and postgraduate training at Harvard University and Niels Bohr’s Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen. I then study the research choices he made during the first 10 years of his career (when he was a faculty member at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and a frequent visitor to the Bell Telephone Laboratories) in the context of the theoretical solid-state physics agenda of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Subsequent sections discuss his move to the University of California, San Diego, identify the research issue which led directly to DFT, and analyze the two foundational papers of the theory. The paper concludes with an explanation of how the chemists came to award “their” Nobel Prize to the physicist Kohn and a discussion of why he was unusually well suited to create the theory in the first place.",Andrew Zangwill,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-014-0140-x,"Variational Principle,Local Density Approximation,American Physical Society,Hartree Equation,Bell Telephone Laboratory"

The local approximation of convex spherical earth surface by a flat surface is shown to be inefficient (according to the electrodynamics viewpoint). The boundaryvalue problem of “pseudo surface” waves of an open spherical waveguide is posed and solved. The peak amplitude of the field and corresponding components of the Poynting vector for the waves is demonstrated to be not appressed to earth surface; this fundamentally differs from the theory of surface waves. Accordingly, solving the practical problem of wave excitation by means of surface antennas seems to have little effect. Therefore, to design coast-earth radio tracking systems for observing sea surface beyond the horizontal line, it is suggested to employ the following fact. The field of these waves in the underwater (underground) area is always appressed to the concave spherical surface.",A. V. Kukushkin1 & A. V.

1356,A germ-grain model applied to the morphological study of dual phase steel,"The mechanical properties of dual Phase steels (DP steels) are strictly related to the spatial distribution and the geometry of the two phases composing the steel, ferrite and martensite. Due to the high costs to obtain images of sections of steel samples, one important industrial problem is the reduction of the number of 2D sections needed to build and simulate a geometric model which may reproduce in a realistic way the 3D geometry of the material. In this context, the availability of suitable techniques of parameter estimation or identification is fundamental to solve the problem.In this work we present a germ-grain model which approximates the main geometric characteristics of the martensite, taking into account the inhomogeneities of the material. The parameters of the model are estimated on the basis of the morphological characteristics of the images of about 150 tomographic sections of a real sample, quantified by the Minkowski functionals. Here we replace the Mahalanobis distance, introduced in previous literature, with the \(\mathcal{N}\)-distance, which provides computational advantages. In order to test if the estimated model is reproducing the distribution of the Minkowski functionals of the real material, both confidence bands from the simulated model are computed and compared with the real data and techniques for the detection of functional outliers are applied to quantify the accuracy of fit of the estimated model.","Alessandra Micheletti

1357,The Betti map associated to a section of an abelian scheme,"Given a point \(\xi \) on a complex abelian variety A, its abelian logarithm can be expressed as a linear combination of the periods of A with real coefficients, the Betti coordinates of \(\xi \). When \((A, \xi )\) varies in an algebraic family, these coordinates define a system of multivalued real-analytic functions. Computing its rank (in the sense of differential geometry) becomes important when one is interested about how often \(\xi \) takes a torsion value (for instance, Manin’s theorem of the kernel implies that this coordinate system is constant in a family without fixed part only when \(\xi \) is a torsion section). We compute this rank in terms of the rank of a certain contracted form of the Kodaira–Spencer map associated to \((A, \xi )\) (assuming A without fixed part, and \({\mathbb {Z}}\xi \) Zariski-dense in A), and deduce some explicit lower bounds in special situations. For instance, we determine this rank in relative dimension \(\le 3\), and study in detail the case of jacobians of families of hyperelliptic curves. Our main application, obtained in collaboration with Z. Gao, states that if \(A\rightarrow S\) is a principally polarized abelian scheme of relative dimension g which has no non-trivial endomorphism (on any finite covering), and if the image of S in the moduli space \({{\mathcal {A}}}_g\) has dimension at least g, then the Betti map of any non-torsion section \(\xi \) is generically a submersion, so that \(\,\xi ^{-1}A_{\mathrm{tors}}\) is dense in \(S({\mathbb {C}})\).","Y.

The main result of the present work is an a-posteriori theorem which provides mathematically rigorous error bounds. The hypotheses of the theorem are checked with computer assistance.

1360,On the geometric analysis of a quartic–quadratic optimization problem under a spherical constraint,"This paper considers the problem of solving a special quartic–quadratic optimization problem with a single sphere constraint, namely, finding a global and local minimizer of \(\frac{1}{2}\mathbf {z}^{*}A\mathbf {z}+\frac{\beta }{2}\sum _{k=1}^{n}|z_{k}|^{4}\) such that \(\Vert \mathbf {z}\Vert _{2}=1\). This problem spans multiple domains including quantum mechanics and chemistry sciences and we investigate the geometric properties of this optimization problem. Fourth-order optimality conditions are derived for characterizing local and global minima. When the matrix in the quadratic term is diagonal, the problem has no spurious local minima and global solutions can be represented explicitly and calculated in \(O(n\log {n})\) operations. When A is a rank one matrix, the global minima of the problem are unique under certain phase shift schemes. The strict-saddle property, which can imply polynomial time convergence of second-order-type algorithms, is established when the coefficient \(\beta \) of the quartic term is either at least \(O(n^{3/2})\) or not larger than O(1). Finally, the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz exponent of quartic–quadratic problem is estimated and it is shown that the largest exponent is at least 1/4 for a broad class of stationary points.","Haixiang Zhang1, Andre Milzarek2,3,4, Zaiwen Wen

In this work we introduce an algorithm for QCQP that requires finding just one eigenpair of a generalized eigenvalue problem, and involves no outer iterations other than the (usually black-box) iterations for computing the eigenpair. Numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm. We also analyze the QCQP solution extensively, including difficult cases, and show that the canonical form of a matrix pair gives a complete classification of the QCQP in terms of boundedness and attainability, and explain how to obtain a global solution whenever it exists.","Satoru Adachi1 & Yuji Nakatsukasa

1366,Signal analysis via instantaneous frequency estimation of signal components,"The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm, introduced by Huang et al. (Proc Roy Soc Lond Ser A Math Phys Eng Sci 454(1971):903–995, 1998), is arguably the most popular mathematical scheme for non-stationary signal decomposition and analysis. The objective of EMD is to separate a given signal into a number of components, called intrinsic mode functions (IMF’s) after which the instantaneous frequency (IF) and amplitude of each IMF are computed through Hilbert spectral analysis (HSA). On the other hand, the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform (SST), introduced by Daubechies and Maes (Wavelets in Medicine and Biology, pp. 527–546, 1996) and further developed by Daubechies et al. (Appl Comput Harmon Anal 30:243–261, 2011), is applied to estimate the IF’s of all signal components of the given signal, based on one single reference “IF function”, under the assumption that the signal components satisfy certain strict properties of a so-called adaptive harmonic model, before the signal components of the model are recovered. The objective of our paper is to develop a hybrid EMD-SST computational scheme by applying a “modified SST” to each IMF of the EMD, as an alternative approach to the original EMD-HSA method. While our modified SST assures non-negative instantaneous frequencies of the IMF’s, application of the EMD scheme eliminates the dependence on a single reference IF value as well as the guessing work of the number of signal components in the original SST approach. Our modification of the SST consists of applying vanishing moment wavelets (introduced in a recent paper by C.K. Chui, Y.-T. Lin and H.-T. Wu) with stacked knots to process signals on bounded or half-infinite time intervals, and spline curve fitting with optimal smoothing parameter selection through generalized cross-validation. In addition, we formulate a local cubic spline interpolation scheme for real-time realization of the EMD sifting process that improves over the standard global cubic spline interpolation, both in quality and computational cost, particularly when applied to bounded and half-infinite time intervals.",Charles K.

Choosing delay (or the adjustment coefficient in the goods market α) as bifurcation parameter, the existence of Hopf bifurcation is investigated in detail.

1370,Wavelet Analysis on Adeles and Pseudo-Differential Operators,"This paper is devoted to wavelet analysis on the adele ring \({\mathbb{A}}\) and the theory of pseudo-differential operators. We develop the technique which gives the possibility to generalize finite-dimensional results of wavelet analysis to the case of adeles \({\mathbb{A}}\) by using infinite tensor products of Hilbert spaces. We prove that \(L^{2}({\mathbb{A}})=\bigotimes_{e,p\in\{\infty,2,3,5,\dots\}}L^{2}({{\mathbb{Q}}}_{p})\) is the infinite tensor product of the spaces L
2(ℚ
p
). This description allows us to construct an infinite family of Haar wavelet bases on \(L^{2}({\mathbb{A}})\) which can be obtained by shifts and multi-dilations. The adelic Haar multiresolution analysis (MRA) in \(L^{2}({\mathbb{A}})\) is constructed. To do this, we generalize the idea of constructing the separable multidimensional MRA (suggested by Y. Meyer and S. Mallat) to the infinite dimensional case. In the framework of this MRA infinite family of Haar wavelet bases is constructed. We introduce the adelic Lizorkin spaces of test functions and distributions and give the characterization of these spaces in terms of adelic wavelet functions. One class of pseudo-differential operators (including the fractional operator) is studied on the Lizorkin spaces. A criterion for an adelic wavelet function to be an eigenfunction for a pseudo-differential operator is derived. We prove that any wavelet function is an eigenfunction of the fractional operator.","A. Y. Khrennikov1, A. V. Kosyak2 & V. M.

1371,Lagrange stability and boundedness of discrete event systems,"Recently it has been shown that the conventional notions of stability in the sense of Lyapunov and asymptotic stability can be used to characterize the stability properties of a class of “logical” discrete event systems (DES). Moreover, it has been shown that stability analysis via the choice of appropriate Lyapunov functions can be used for DES and can be applied to several DES applications including manufacturing systems and computer networks (Passino et al. 1994, Burgess and Passino 1994). In this paper we extend the conventional notions and analysis of uniform boundedness, uniform ultimate boundedness, practical stability, finite time stability, and Lagrange stability so that they apply to the class of logical DES that can be defined on a metric space. Within this stability-theoretic framework we show that the standard Petri net-theoretic notions of boundedness are special cases of Lagrange stability and uniform boundedness. In addition we show that the Petri ent-theoretic approach to boundedness analysis is actually a Lyapunov approach in that the net-theoretic analysis actually produces an appropriate Lyapunov function. Moreover, via the Lyapunov approach we provide a sufficient condition for the uniform ultimate boundedness of General Petri nets. To illustrate the Petri net results, we study the boundedness properties of a rate synchronization network for manufacturing systems. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis of the Lagrange stability of a single-machine manufacturing system that uses a priority-based part servicing policy.","Kevin M. Passino1, Kevin L.

1380,Algorithms of Intrinsic Complexity for Point Searching in Compact Real Singular Hypersurfaces,"For a real square-free multivariate polynomial F, we treat the general problem of finding real solutions of the equation F=0, provided that the real solution set {F=0}ℝ is compact. We allow that the equation F=0 may have singular real solutions. We are going to decide whether this equation has a non-singular real solution and, if this is the case, we exhibit one for each generically smooth connected component of {F=0}ℝ. We design a family of elimination algorithms of intrinsic complexity which solves this problem. In the worst case, the complexity of our algorithms does not exceed the already known extrinsic complexity bound of (nd)O(n) for the elimination problem under consideration, where n is the number of indeterminates of F and d its (positive) degree. In the case that the real variety defined by F is smooth, there already exist algorithms of intrinsic complexity that solve our problem. However, these algorithms cannot be used in case when F=0 admits F-singular real solutions.An elimination algorithm of intrinsic complexity presupposes that the polynomial F is encoded by an essentially division-free arithmetic circuit of size L (i.e., F can be evaluated by means of L additions, subtractions and multiplications, using scalars from a previously fixed real ground field, say ℚ) and that there is given an invariant δ(F) which (roughly speaking) depends only on the geometry of the complex hypersurface defined by F. The complexity of the algorithm (measured in terms of the number of arithmetic operations in ℚ) is then linear in L and polynomial in n,d and δ(F).In order to find such a geometric invariant δ(F), we consider suitable incidence varieties which in fact are algebraic families of dual polar varieties of the complex hypersurface defined by F. The generic dual polar varieties of these incidence varieties are called bipolar varieties of the equation F=0. The maximal degree of these bipolar varieties then becomes the essential ingredient of our invariant δ(F).","Bernd Bank1, Marc Giusti2, Joos Heintz3,4, Lutz Lehmann1 & …Luis Miguel Pardo",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-011-9112-6,"Real polynomial equation solving,Intrinsic complexity,Singularities,Polar and bipolar varieties,Degree of varieties"

1410,Tabu Search When Noise is Present: An Illustration in the Context of Cause and Effect Analysis,"In the field of combinatorial optimization, it may be possible to more accurately represent reality through stochastic models rather than deterministic ones. When randomness is present in a problem, algorithm designers face new difficulties which complicate their task significantly. Finding a proper mathematical formulation and a fast evaluation of the objective function are two major issues. In this paper we propose a new tabu search algorithm based on sampling and statistical tests. The algorithm is shown to perform well in a stochastic environment where the quality of feasible solutions cannot be computed easily. This new search principle is illustrated in the field of cause and effect analysis where the true cause of an undesirable effect needs to be eliminated. A set of n potential causes is identified and each of them is assumed to be the true cause with a given probability. The time to investigate a cause is a random variable with a known probability distribution. Associated with each cause is the reward obtained if the cause is really the true cause. The decision problem is to sequence the n potential causes so as to maximize the expected reward realized before a specified time horizon.",Daniel Costa1 & Edward A.

. The usual equivalence group and the extended one including transformations which are nonlocal with respect to arbitrary elements are first constructed. Then using the technique of variable gauges of arbitrary elements under equivalence transformations, we restrict ourselves to the symmetry group classifications for the equations with two different gauges g=1 and g=h. In order to get the ultimate classification, the method of furcate split is also used and consequently a number of new interesting nonlinear invariant models which have non-trivial invariance algebra are obtained. As an application, exact solutions for some equations which are singled out from the classification results are constructed by the classical method of Lie reduction.The classification of nonclassical symmetries for the classes of differential equations with gauge g=1 is discussed within the framework of singular reduction operator. This enabled to obtain some exact solutions of the nonlinear telegraph equation which are invariant under certain conditional symmetries.Using the direct method, we also carry out two classifications of local conservation laws up to equivalence relations generated by both usual and extended equivalence groups.

The vast number of dendritic geometries, combined with heterogeneous properties of the cell membrane, continue to challenge scientists in predicting neuronal input-output relationships, even in the case of sub-threshold dendritic currents. The Green’s function obtained for a given dendritic geometry provides this functional relationship for passive or quasi-active dendrites and can be constructed by a sum-over-trips approach based on a path integral formalism. In this paper, we introduce a number of efficient algorithms for realisation of the sum-over-trips framework and investigate the convergence of these algorithms on different dendritic geometries. We demonstrate that the convergence of the trip sampling methods strongly depends on dendritic morphology as well as the biophysical properties of the cell membrane. For real morphologies, the number of trips to guarantee a small convergence error might become very large and strongly affect computational efficiency. As an alternative, we introduce a highly-efficient matrix method which can be applied to arbitrary branching structures.","Quentin Caudron1,2, Simon R Donnelly3, Samuel PC Brand1,4 & …Yulia Timofeeva1,",The Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2190-8567-2-11,"Dendrites,Path integral,Sum-over-trips,Morphology,Dendritic computation"

This new environment improves on its predecessor by addressing some of the shortcomings of the original PAVER (Bussieck et al. in Global optimization and constraint satisfaction, lecture notes in computer science, vol 2861, pp 223–238. Springer, Berlin, 2003. doi:10.1007/978-3-540-39901-8_17) and extending its capabilities. The changes serve to further the original goals of PAVER (automation of the visualization and summarization of benchmarking data) while making the environment more accessible for the use of and modification by the entire community of potential users. In particular, we have targeted the end-users of optimization software, as they are best able to make the many subjective choices necessary to produce impactful results when benchmarking optimization software. We illustrate with some sample analyses conducted via PAVER 2.0.","Michael R. Bussieck1, Steven P.

1423,Differentiation and the Balian-Low Theorem,"The Balian-Low theorem (BLT) is a key result in time-frequency analysis, originally stated by Balian and, independently, by Low, as: If a Gabor system \(\{e^{2\pi imbt} \, g(t-na)\}_{m,n \in \mbox{\bf Z}}\)
with \(ab=1\) forms an orthonormal basis for \(L^2({\bf R}),\) then
$\left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty |t \, g(t)|^2 \, dt\right) \, \left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\gamma \, \hat g(\gamma)|^2 \, d\gamma\right) = +\infty.$ The BLT was later extended from orthonormal bases to exact frames. This paper presents a tutorial on Gabor systems, the BLT, and related topics, such as the Zak transform and Wilson bases. Because of the fact that    
\((g')^{\wedge}(\gamma) = 2 \pi i \gamma \, \hat g(\gamma)\),
the role of differentiation in the proof of the BLT is examined carefully.
The major new contributions of this paper are the construction of a complete 
Gabor system of the form \(\{e^{2\pi ib_mt\} \, g(t-a_n)}\) such that 
\(\{(a_n,b_m)\}\) has density strictly less than 1, an Amalgam BLT that provides distinct restrictions on Gabor systems \(\{e^{2\pi imbt} \, g(t-na)\}\) that form exact frames, and a new proof of the BLT for exact frames that does not require differentiation and relies only on classical real variable methods from harmonic analysis.","John J.

1424,On nonsymmetric saddle point matrices that allow conjugate gradient iterations,"Linear systems in saddle point form are usually highly indefinite,which often slows down iterative solvers such as Krylov subspace methods. It has been noted by several authors that negating the second block row of a symmetric indefinite saddle point matrix leads to a nonsymmetric matrix \({{\mathcal A}}\) whose spectrum is entirely contained in the right half plane. In this paper we study conditions so that \({{\mathcal A}}\) is diagonalizable with a real and positive spectrum. These conditions are based on necessary and sufficient conditions for positive definiteness of a certain bilinear form,with respect to which \({{\mathcal A}}\) is symmetric. In case the latter conditions are satisfied, there exists a well defined conjugate gradient (CG) method for solving linear systems with \({{\mathcal A}}\). We give an efficient implementation of this method, discuss practical issues such as error bounds, and present numerical experiments.",Jörg Liesen1 & Beresford N.

1427,"Whitham Equations, Bergman Kernel and Lax—Levermore Minimizer","We study multiphase solutions of the Whitham equations. The Whitham equations describe the zero dispersion limit of the Cauchy problem for the Korteweg—de Vries (KdV) equation. The zero dispersion solution of the KdV equation is determined by the Lax—Levermore minimization problem. The minimizer is a measurable function on the real line. When the support of the minimizer consists of a finite number of disjoint intervals to be determined, the minimization problem can be reduced to a scalar Riemann Hilbert (RH) problem. For each fixed x and t ≥ 0, the end-points of the contour are determined by the solution of the Whitham equations. The Lax—Levermore minimizer and the solution of the Whitham equations are described in terms of a kernel related to the Bergman kernel. At t = 0 the support of the minimizer consists of one interval for any value of x, while for t > 0, the number of intervals is larger than one in some regions of the (x,t) plane where the multiphase solutions of the Whitham equations develop. The increase of the number of intervals happens whenever the solution of the Whitham equations has a point of gradient catastrophe. For a class of smooth monotonically increasing initial data, we show that the support of the Lax—Levermore minimizer increases or decreases the number of its intervals by one near each point of gradient catastrophe. This result justifies the formation and extinction of the multiphase solutions of the Whitham equations. Furthermore we characterize a class of initial data for which all the points of gradient catastrophe occur only a finite number of times and therefore the support of the Lax—Levermore minimizer consists of a finite number of disjoint intervals for any x and t ≥ 0. This corresponds to give an upper bound to the genus of the solution of the Whitham equations. Similar results are obtained for the semi-classical limit of the defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation.","Tamara Grava1,",Acta Applicandae Mathematica,2004,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B%3AACAP.0000026694.42172.8b,"Whitham equations,Riemann—Hilbert problem,Riemann surface,Bergman kernel,linear over-determined systems of Euler—Poisson—Darboux type,Lax—Levermore minimizer"

i
 (which are generally complex numbers) are required in order of ascending real part. The problem then is to find the roots of a transcendental equation (eigenequation) in the complex plane and arranged in order of ascending real part.A theorem is proved on the number, location and nature of the roots of this equation with the real part in fixed intervals of length π. Excellent initial estimates of the real part of the complex roots become available, and so are bounds, within which single real roots exist. This enables the determination of any number of roots in ascending order of real part. The critical angles at which the eigenvalues change nature are also determined. It is shown that for certain cases and for the symmetric mode of deformation, the eigenvalue λ=1 does not represent a rigid body rotation, therefore it has to be included in the series representation of the stresses. The coefficientsK

Let A be an \(n\times n\) random matrix with i.i.d real subgaussian entries of zero mean and unit variance. We show that with probability at least \(1-e^{-\log ^{2} n}\)$$\begin{aligned} \min \limits _{I\subset [n],\,|I|= m}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}_I\Vert \ge \frac{m^{3/2}}{n^{3/2}\log ^Cn}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}\Vert \end{aligned}$$for any real eigenvector \(\mathbf{{v}}\) and any \(m\in [\log ^C n,n]\), where \(\mathbf{{v}}_I\) denotes the restriction of \(\mathbf{{v}}\) to I. Further, when the entries of A are complex, with i.i.d real and imaginary parts, we show that with probability at least \(1-e^{-\log ^{2} n}\)all eigenvectors of A are delocalized in the sense that $$\begin{aligned} \min \limits _{I\subset [n],\,|I|= m}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}_I\Vert \ge \frac{m}{n\log ^Cn}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}\Vert \end{aligned}$$for all \(m\in [\log ^C{n},n]\). Comparing with related results, in the range \(m\in [\log ^{C'}{n},n/\log ^{C'}{n}]\) in the i.i.d setting and with weaker probability estimates, our lower bounds on \(\Vert \mathbf{{v}}_I\Vert \) strengthen an earlier estimate \(\min \nolimits _{|I|= m}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}_I\Vert \ge c(m/n)^6\Vert \mathbf{{v}}\Vert \) obtained in Rudelson and Vershynin (Geom Funct Anal 26(6):1716–1776, 2016), and bounds \(\min \nolimits _{|I|= m}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}_I\Vert \ge c(m/n)^2\Vert \mathbf{{v}}\Vert \) (in the real setting) and \(\min \nolimits _{|I|= m}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}_I\Vert \ge c(m/n)^{3/2}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}\Vert \) (in the complex setting) established in Luh and O’Rourke (Eigenvector delocalization for non-Hermitian random matrices and applications. arXiv:1810.00489).

1431,Iterative Filtering Decomposition Based on Local Spectral Evolution Kernel,"The synthesizing information, achieving understanding, and deriving insight from increasingly massive, time-varying, noisy and possibly conflicting data sets are some of most challenging tasks in the present information age. Traditional technologies, such as Fourier transform and wavelet multi-resolution analysis, are inadequate to handle all of the above-mentioned tasks. The empirical model decomposition (EMD) has emerged as a new powerful tool for resolving many challenging problems in data processing and analysis. Recently, an iterative filtering decomposition (IFD) has been introduced to address the stability and efficiency problems of the EMD. Another data analysis technique is the local spectral evolution kernel (LSEK), which provides a near prefect low pass filter with desirable time-frequency localizations. The present work utilizes the LSEK to further stabilize the IFD, and offers an efficient, flexible and robust scheme for information extraction, complexity reduction, and signal and image understanding. The performance of the present LSEK based IFD is intensively validated over a wide range of data processing tasks, including mode decomposition, analysis of time-varying data, information extraction from nonlinear dynamic systems, etc. The utility, robustness and usefulness of the proposed LESK based IFD are demonstrated via a large number of applications, such as the analysis of stock market data, the decomposition of ocean wave magnitudes, the understanding of physiologic signals and information recovery from noisy images. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of existing methods in the literature. Our results indicate that the LSEK based IFD improves both the efficiency and the stability of conventional EMD algorithms.","Yang Wang1, Guo-Wei Wei1,2 & Siyang Yang",Journal of Scientific Computing,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-011-9496-0,"Empirical mode decomposition,Iterative filtering decomposition,Local spectral evolution kernel,Biomedical signal analysis,Image understanding,Information extraction"

The rhombus solutions exist for all m but the isosceles trapezoid case exists only when m is positive. In fact, there exist asymmetric convex configurations when m<0. In contrast to the Newtonian four-body problem with two equal pairs of masses, where the symmetry of all convex central configurations is unproven, the equations in the vortex case are easier to handle, allowing for a complete classification of all solutions. Precise counts on the number and type of solutions (equivalence classes) for different values of m, as well as a description of some of the bifurcations that occur, are provided. Our techniques involve a combination of analysis, and modern and computational algebraic geometry.","Marshall Hampton1, Gareth E.

To provide accurate results, interval computations require small input intervals; this explains why bisection is so often employed in interval algorithms. The MPFI library has been built in order to fulfill this need. Indeed, no existing library met the required specifications. The main features of this library are briefly given and a comparison with a fixed-precision interval arithmetic, on a specific problem, is presented. It shows that the overhead due to the multiple precision is completely acceptable. Eventually, some applications based on MPFI are given: robotics, isolation of polynomial real roots (by an algorithm combining symbolic and numerical computations) and approximation of real roots with arbitrary accuracy.",Nathalie Revol1 & Fabrice Rouillier,Reliable Computing,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11155-005-6891-y,"Mathematical Modeling,Numerical Computation,Computational Mathematic,Industrial Mathematic,Accurate Result"

We show that the largest eigenvalues have asymptotic distributions near the phase transition in the rank one spiked real Wishart setting and its general β analogue, proving a conjecture of Baik et al. (Ann Probab 33:1643–1697, 2005). We also treat shifted mean Gaussian orthogonal and β ensembles. Such results are entirely new in the real case; in the complex case we strengthen existing results by providing optimal scaling assumptions. One obtains the known limiting random Schrödinger operator on the half-line, but the boundary condition now depends on the perturbation. We derive several characterizations of the limit laws in which β appears as a parameter, including a simple linear boundary value problem. This PDE description recovers known explicit formulas at β = 2,4, yielding in particular a new and simple proof of the Painlevé representations for these Tracy–Widom distributions.",Alex Bloemendal1 & Bálint Virág,Probability Theory and Related Fields,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-012-0443-2,"60B20,Random matrices (probabilistic aspects)"
1436,Subquadratic Algorithms for Algebraic 3SUM,"The 3SUM problem asks if an input n-set of real numbers contains a triple whose sum is zero. We qualify such a triple of degenerate because the probability of finding one in a random input is zero. We consider the 3POL problem, an algebraic generalization of 3SUM where we replace the sum function by a constant-degree polynomial in three variables. The motivations are threefold. Raz et al. gave an \(O(n^{11/6})\) upper bound on the number of degenerate triples for the 3POL problem. We give algorithms for the corresponding problem of counting them. Grønlund and Pettie designed subquadratic algorithms for 3SUM. We prove that 3POL admits bounded-degree algebraic decision trees of depth \(O(n^{12/7+\varepsilon })\), and we prove that 3POL can be solved in \(O(n^2 {(\log \log n)}^{3/2} / {(\log n)}^{1/2})\) time in the real-RAM model, generalizing their results. Finally, we shed light on the General Position Testing (GPT) problem: “Given n points in the plane, do three of them lie on a line?”, a key problem in computational geometry: we show how to solve GPT in subquadratic time when the input points lie on a small number of constant-degree polynomial curves. Many other geometric degeneracy testing problems reduce to 3POL.","Luis Barba1, Jean Cardinal2, John Iacono3, Stefan Langerman2, Aurélien Ooms

1437,On the spectral problem associated with the time-periodic nonlinear Schrödinger equation,"According to its Lax pair formulation, the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation can be expressed as the compatibility condition of two linear ordinary differential equations with an analytic dependence on a complex parameter. The first of these equations—often referred to as the x-part of the Lax pair—can be rewritten as an eigenvalue problem for a Zakharov–Shabat operator. The spectral analysis of this operator is crucial for the solution of the initial value problem for the NLS equation via inverse scattering techniques. For space-periodic solutions, this leads to the existence of a Birkhoff normal form, which beautifully exhibits the structure of NLS as an infinite-dimensional completely integrable system. In this paper, we take the crucial steps towards developing an analogous picture for time-periodic solutions by performing a spectral analysis of the t-part of the Lax pair with a periodic potential.","Jonatan Lenells1 & Ronald Quirchmayr

We then conclude that orbits of renormalization are asymptotic to the full renormalization horseshoe, which we construct. Our argument for exponential contraction is based on a precompactness property of the renormalization operator (“beau bounds”), which is leveraged in the abstract analysis of holomorphic iteration. Besides greater generality, it yields a unified approach to all combinatorics and degrees: there is no need to account for the varied geometric details of the dynamics, which were the typical source of contraction in previous restricted proofs.","Artur Avila1,2 & Mikhail Lyubich",Publications mathématiques de l'IHÉS,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10240-011-0034-2,"Schwarz Lemma,Holomorphic Motion,Renormalization Operator,Hybrid Lamination,Beltrami Differential"

It is assumed that each coefficient of F can be approximated to any specified error bound and refer to such coefficients as bitstream coefficients. The presented method is exact, complete and deterministic.

Firstly, our approach can be combined with any existing subdivision method for isolating the roots of a polynomial with rational coefficients. Secondly, the approximation demand on the coefficients and the bit complexity of our approach is considerably smaller. In particular, we can replace the worst-case quantity σ(F) by the average-case quantity \({\prod_{i=1}^n\sqrt[n] {\sigma_i}}\) , where σ

To restore the growth of production of goods and overcome deflationary period, the Central Bank, at the cost of capital employed in production, should establish the amount of money in circulation that ensures the necessary level of inflation.

1442,A Primer on Differentiation,"The central idea of differential calculus is that the derivative of a function defines the best local linear approximation to the function near a given point. This basic idea, together with some representation theorems from linear algebra, unifies the various derivatives—gradients, Jacobians, Hessians, and so forth—encountered in engineering and optimization. The basic differentiation rules presented in calculus classes, notably the product and chain rules, allow the computation of the gradients and Hessians needed by optimization algorithms, even when the underlying operators are quite complex. Examples include the solution operators of time-dependent and steady-state partial differential equations. Alternatives to the hand-coding of derivatives are finite differences and automatic differentiation, both of which save programming time at the possible cost of run-time efficiency.",Mark S.

(J Theor Biol 249(2):262–270, 2007) in order to describe the grouping of social animals and to test whether genetic relatedness is the main driving force behind the group formation process. Durand and François (J Math Biol 60(3):451–468, 2010) provided a first stochastic analysis of this model by deriving (amongst other things) asymptotic expansions for the mean value of the number of groups. In this paper, we will give a much finer analysis of the number of groups. More precisely, we will derive asymptotic expansions for all higher moments and give a complete characterization of the possible limit laws. In the most interesting case (neutral model), we will prove a central limit theorem with a surprising normalization. In the remaining cases, the limit law will be either a mixture of a discrete and continuous law or a discrete law.

1446,Banking Regulation of Macroeconomic Processes,"It has been determined that given the same factors of production, bank regulation of macroeconomic processes can lead to sustainable economic growth with inflationary self-regulation of market equilibrium and a catastrophic economy decline with deflationary self-regulation of market equilibrium. It is impossible to regulate the amount of money in circulation by simultaneously changing the interest rate and the exchange rate, because they are functionally dependent. There is a marginal interest rate, after which it is impossible to carry out foreign exchange transactions due to a reduction of cash in circulation through negative foreign currency. The exit of the economy from recession or depression through inflation can significantly increase the production factors.",B. B.

Finally, numerical simulations supporting the theoretical analysis are provided.",Changjin Xu1 & Peiluan Li,Advances in Difference Equations,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13662-015-0711-4,"exponential RED,stability,Hopf bifurcation,congestion control,periodic solution"
1448,"Topological transformation groups of manifolds over non-Archimedean fields, their representations, and quasi-invariant measures. I","Diffeomorphism groups and loop groups of manifolds on Banach spaces over non-Archimedean fields are defined. Moreover, for these groups, finite-and infinite-dimensional manifolds over the corresponding fields are considered. The group structure, the differential-geometric structure, and also the topological structure of diffeomorphism groups and loops groups are studied. We prove that these groups do not locally satisfy the Campbell-Hausdorff formula. The principal distinctions in the structure for the Archimedean and classical cases are found. The quasi-invariant measures on these groups with respect to dense subgroups are constructed. Stochastic processes on topological transformation groups of manifolds and, in particular, on diffeomorphism groups and on loop groups and also the corresponding transition probabilities are constructed. Regular, strongly continuous, unitary representations of dense subgroups of topological transformation groups of manifolds, in particular, those of diffeomorphism groups and loop groups associated with quasi-invariant measures on groups and also on the corresponding configurational spaces are constructed. The conditions imposed on the measure and groups under which these unitary representations are irreducible are found.

Whereas analytically each radius r up to the radius of convergence is equal, numerical stability strongly depends on r. We give a comprehensive study of this effect; in particular, we show that there is a unique radius that minimizes the loss of accuracy caused by round-off errors. For large classes of functions, though not for all, this radius actually gives about full accuracy; a remarkable fact that we explain by the theory of Hardy spaces, by the Wiman–Valiron and Levin–Pfluger theory of entire functions, and by the saddle-point method of asymptotic analysis.

1452,On fluidization of discrete event models: observation and control of continuous Petri nets,"As a preliminary overview, this work provides first a broad tutorial on the fluidization of discrete event dynamic models, an efficient technique for dealing with the classical state explosion problem. Even if named as continuous or fluid, the relaxed models obtained are frequently hybrid in a technical sense. Thus, there is plenty of room for using discrete, hybrid and continuous model techniques for logical verification, performance evaluation and control studies. Moreover, the possibilities for transferring concepts and techniques from one modeling paradigm to others are very significant, so there is much space for synergy. As a central modeling paradigm for parallel and synchronized discrete event systems, Petri nets (PNs) are then considered in much more detail. In this sense, this paper is somewhat complementary to David and Alla (2010). Our presentation of fluid views or approximations of PNs has sometimes a flavor of a survey, but also introduces some new ideas or techniques. Among the aspects that distinguish the adopted approach are: the focus on the relationships between discrete and continuous PN models, both for untimed, i.e., fully non-deterministic abstractions, and timed versions; the use of structure theory of (discrete) PNs, algebraic and graph based concepts and results; and the bridge to Automatic Control Theory. After discussing observability and controllability issues, the most technical part in this work, the paper concludes with some remarks and possible directions for future research.","Manuel Silva1, Jorge Júlvez1, Cristian Mahulea1 & …C.

1453,"A synthetic model for asset-liability management in life insurance, and analysis of the SCR with the standard formula","The aim of this paper is to introduce a synthetic ALM model that catches the key features of life insurance contracts. First, it keeps track of both market and book values to apply the regulatory profit sharing rule. Second, it introduces a determination of the crediting rate to policyholders that is close to practice and is a trade-off between the regulatory rate, a competitor rate and the available profits. Third, it considers an investment in bonds that enables to match a part of the cash outflow due to surrenders, while avoiding to store the trading history. We use this model to evaluate the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) with the standard formula, and show that the choice of the interest rate model is important to get a meaningful model after the regulatory shocks on the interest rate. We discuss the different values of the SCR modules first in a framework with moderate interest rates using the shocks of the present legislation, and then we consider a low interest framework with the latest recommendation of the EIOPA on the shocks. In both cases, we illustrate the importance of matching cash-flows and its impact on the SCR.","Aurélien Alfonsi1,2, Adel Cherchali1,2 & Jose Arturo Infante Acevedo",European Actuarial Journal,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13385-020-00240-3,"ALM model,Solvency capital requirement,Standard formula,Cash-flow matching,Liquidity gap,Surrender risk,Book value,Profit sharing"

1455,Hamiltonians Generated by Parseval Frames,"It is known that self-adjoint Hamiltonians with purely discrete eigenvalues can be written as (infinite) linear combination of mutually orthogonal projectors with eigenvalues as coefficients of the expansion. The projectors are defined by the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonians. In some recent papers, this expansion has been extended to the case in which these eigenvectors form a Riesz basis or, more recently, a \({\mathcal{D}}\)-quasi basis (Bagarello and Bellomonte in J. Phys. A 50:145203, 2017, Bagarello et al. in J. Math. Phys. 59:033506, 2018), rather than an orthonormal basis. Here we discuss what can be done when these sets are replaced by Parseval frames. This interest is motivated by physical reasons, and in particular by the fact that the mathematical Hilbert space where the physical system is originally defined, contains sometimes also states which cannot really be occupied by the physical system itself. In particular, we show what changes in the spectrum of the observables, when going from orthonormal bases to Parseval frames. In this perspective we propose the notion of \(E\)-connection for observables. Several examples are discussed.","F. Bagarello

This is done in two parts. Following Vinter approach (SIAM J Control Optim 31(2):518–538, 1993) and using occupation measures, the optimal control problem is written into a linear programming problem of infinite-dimension (weak formulation). Thanks to Interval arithmetic, we provide a relaxation of this infinite-dimensional linear programming problem by a finite dimensional linear programming problem. A proof that the optimal value of the finite dimensional linear programming problem is a lower bound to the optimal value of the control problem is given. Moreover, according to the fineness of the discretization and the size of the chosen test function family, obtained optimal values of each finite dimensional linear programming problem form a sequence of lower bounds which converges to the optimal value of the initial optimal control problem. Examples will illustrate the principle of the methodology.","Nicolas Delanoue

We study a reformulation of the standard iteration of PSO (Clerc and Kennedy in IEEE Trans Evol Comput 6(1) 2002), (Kennedy and Eberhart in IEEE Service Center, Piscataway, IV: 1942–1948, 1995) into a linear dynamic system. We carry out our analysis on a generalized PSO iteration, which includes the standard one proposed in the literature. We analyze three issues for the resulting generalized PSO: first, for any particle we give both theoretical and numerical evidence on an efficient choice of the starting point. Then, we study the cases in which either deterministic and uniformly randomly distributed coefficients are considered in the scheme. Finally, some convergence analysis is also provided, along with some necessary conditions to avoid diverging trajectories. The results proved in the paper can be immediately applied to the standard PSO iteration.","Emilio F.

1458,Analysis of stability boundaries of satellite’s equilibrium attitude in a circular orbit,"An asymmetric satellite equipped with control momentum gyroscopes (CMGs) with the center of mass of the system moving uniformly in a circular orbit was considered. The stability of a relative equilibrium attitude of the satellite was analyzed using Lyapunov’s direct method. The Lyapunov function V is a positive definite integral of the total energy of the perturbed motion of the system. The asymptotic stability analysis of the stationary motion of the conservative system was based on the Barbashin–Krasovskii theorem on the nonexistence of integer trajectories of the set \(\dot V\), which was obtained using the differential equations of motion of the satellite with CMGs. By analyzing the sign definiteness of the quadratic part of V, it was found earlier by V.V. Sazonov that the stability region is described by four strict inequalities. The asymptotic stability at the stability boundary was analyzed by sequentially turning these inequalities into equalities with terms of orders higher than the second taken into account in V. The sign definiteness analysis of the inhomogeneous function V at the stability boundary involved a huge amount of computations related to the multiplication, expansion, substitution, and factorization of symbolic expressions. The computations were performed by applying a computer algebra system on a personal computer.",M. A.

In particular, we analytically obtain a certain threshold value of the basic reproduction number \(R_{0}\) and describe the existence conditions of multiple equilibrium points. Moreover, it is shown that the stability region of the equilibrium points increases by choosing an appropriate value of the fractional order α.

1460,Error analysis in determining the centroids of circular objects in images,"Detecting the size and/or location of circular object(s) in an image(s) has application in many areas, like, flow diagnostics, biomedical engineering, computer vision, etc. The detection accuracy of circular object(s) largely depends on the accuracy of centroiding algorithm and image preprocessing technique. In the present work, an error analysis is performed in determining the centroids of circular objects using synthetic images with eight different signal-to-noise ratios ranging from 2.7 to 17.8. In the first stage, four different centroiding algorithms, namely, Center of Mass, Weighted Center of Mass, Späth algorithm, and Hough transform, are studied and compared. The error analysis shows that Späth algorithm performs better than other algorithms. In the second stage, various image preprocessing techniques, consisting of two filters, namely, Median and Wiener, and five image segmentation methods, namely, Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) edge detector, basic global thresholding, and Otsu’s global thresholding, are compared to determine the centroids of circular objects using Späth algorithm. It is found that Wiener filter plus LoG edge detector performs better than other preprocessing techniques. Real images of a calibration target (typical in flow diagnostics) and the secondary atomization of water droplets are then considered for centroids detection. These two images are preprocessed using Wiener filter plus LoG edge detector and then processed using Späth algorithm to detect the centroids of circular objects. It is observed that the results of real image of the calibration target and synthetic images are comparable. Also, based on visual inspection, the centroids detected in the real image of water droplets are found to be reasonably accurate.",Sagar Adatrao1 & Mayank Mittal,Computing and Visualization in Science,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00791-017-0286-6,"Centroiding algorithms,Filtering,Segmentation,Image processing"

1462,Analysis of stress intensity factor in orthotropic bi-material mixed interface crack,"Adopting the complex function approach, the paper studies the stress intensity factor in orthotropic bi-material interface cracks under mixed loads. With consideration of the boundary conditions, a new stress function is introduced to transform the problem of bi-material interface crack into a boundary value problem of partial differential equations. Two sets of non-homogeneous linear equations with 16 unknowns are constructed. By solving the equations, the expressions for the real bi-material elastic constant ɛ

t
 and the real stress singularity exponents λ

t
 are obtained with the bi-material engineering parameters satisfying certain conditions. By the uniqueness theorem of limit, undetermined coefficients are determined, and thus the bi-material stress intensity factor in mixed cracks is obtained. The bi-material stress intensity factor characterizes features of mixed cracks. When orthotropic bi-materials are of the same material, the degenerate solution to the stress intensity factor in mixed bi-material interface cracks is in complete agreement with the present classic conclusion. The relationship between the bi-material stress intensity factor and the ratio of bi-material shear modulus and the relationship between the bi-material stress intensity factor and the ratio of bi-material Young’s modulus are given in the numerical analysis.","Wen-bin Zhao

Thus, for example, the notions are appropriate in the context of semi-definite programming. We prove various theorems to demonstrate how the notions can be used in analyzing interior-point methods.

1465,Analysis of biochemical phase shift oscillators by a harmonic balancing technique,"The use of harmonic balancing techniques for theoretically investigating a large class of biochemical phase shift oscillators is outlined and the accuracy of this approximate technique for large dimension nonlinear chemical systems is considered. It is concluded that for the equations under study these techniques can be successfully employed to both find periodic solutions and to indicate those cases which can not oscillate. The technique is a general one and it is possible to state a step by step procedure for its application. It has a substantial advantage in producing results which are immediately valid for arbitrary dimension. As the accuracy of the method increases with dimension, it complements classical small dimension methods.The results obtained by harmonic balancing analysis are compared with those obtained by studying the local stability properties of the singular points of the differential equation. A general theorem is derived which identifies those special cases where the results of first order harmonic balancing are identical to those of local stability analysis, and a necessary condition for this equivalence is derived. As a concrete example, the n-dimensional Goodwin oscillator is considered where ϱ, the Hill coefficient of the feedback metabolite, is equal to three and four. It is shown that for ϱ =3 or 4 and n≤4 the approximation indicates that it is impossible to construct a set of physically permissible reaction constants such that the system possesses a periodic solution. However for n≥5 it is always possible to find a large domain in the reaction constant space giving stable oscillations. A means of constructing such a parameter set is given.

To overcome the difficulty of defining a reasonable Lyapunov function and setting limitations of system parameters, the converse Lyapunov theorem and the disturbance theory are employed. This paper proves that the estimation error of the extended state observer (ESO) and the tracking error of the closed-loop system using ADRC are uniformly ultimately bounded and monotonously diminishing with the increase of their respective bandwidth, so that the stability of the ADRC system could be performed. In order to further illustrate the relationship between the stability range and bandwidths, it analyzes quantitatively the performance of ESO and ADRC based on the root locus and the step response. Finally, an example based on a typical control system is carried out, and simulation results verify the theoretical analysis proved in this paper.","Dongyang Zhang1, Qinghe Wu1 & Xiaolan Yao",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-018-7073-4,"Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC),bandwidth,converse Lyapunov theorem,disturbance theory,nonlinear uncertain systems,stability"

1474,Probabilistic Analysis of Failures in Power Transmission Networks and Phase Transitions: Study Case of a High-Voltage Power Transmission Network,"We present the failure analysis of a study case of a high-voltage power transmission network using the mathematical model of cascading blackouts introduced in Carreras et al. (Chaos 12:985–994, 2002). When the load of the network is randomly perturbed, we study the probability density function of the measure of the size of the resulting blackout as a function of the mean load level. The mathematical model used approximates the network with an undirected graph made of generator, load and junction nodes connected by branches representing the lines of the network. The electric flow in the network is found solving the optimal DC power-flow problem and the sequence of events causing a cascading blackout is simulated using a numerical scheme. The analysis points out the existence of values of the mean total power demand such that for higher values when the blackout size measure increases the decay of the blackout size measure probability density function changes from being best fitted by a negative exponential to being best fitted by an inverse power law. The analogies between this phenomenon and the phase transition phenomenon studied in statistical mechanics are discussed.

The same existence result holds for compact A if n = 2. If A is connected, there exist n distinct nonsingular SO(n)-invariant special Lagrangian extensions of A such that any embedded nonsingular SO(n)-invariant special Lagrangian extension of A agrees with one of these n extensions in some open neighborhood of A.The method employed is an analysis of a singular nonlinear PDE and ultimately calls on the work of Gérard and Tahara to prove the existence of the extension.",Robert L.

1478,Numerical Equilibrium Analysis for Structured Consumer Resource Models,"In this paper, we present methods for a numerical equilibrium and stability analysis for models of a size structured population competing for an unstructured resource. We concentrate on cases where two model parameters are free, and thus existence boundaries for equilibria and stability boundaries can be defined in the (two-parameter) plane. We numerically trace these implicitly defined curves using alternatingly tangent prediction and Newton correction. Evaluation of the maps defining the curves involves integration over individual size and individual survival probability (and their derivatives) as functions of individual age. Such ingredients are often defined as solutions of ODE, i.e., in general only implicitly. In our case, the right-hand sides of these ODE feature discontinuities that are caused by an abrupt change of behavior at the size where juveniles are assumed to turn adult. So, we combine the numerical solution of these ODE with curve tracing methods. We have implemented the algorithms for “Daphnia consuming algae” models in C-code. The results obtained by way of this implementation are shown in the form of graphs.","A. M. de Roos1, O. Diekmann2, P. Getto3 & …M. A.

In real life, sometimes a signal value in a time t may not be known exactly. This paper presents a new mathematical method for processing of such a non-deterministic signal by using interval-valued functions which is called as its model interval signal. If the properties of a signal are completely unknown then we cannot perform the processing of these signals such as determining the autocorrelation function of the non-deterministic signal. Especially, in this work, we give an application to estimate the autocorrelation function of a signal with inexact data. For this purpose we use some new mathematical methods so called quasilinear functional analysis. Our studies give approximative result, although there are no definite results for such signals.

Previous studies have shown that this model displays at least four complex spatial and spatiotemporal group patterns. Here, we use weakly nonlinear analysis to better understand the mechanisms involved in the formation of two of these patterns, namely stationary pulses and traveling trains. We show that both patterns arise through subcritical bifurcations from spatially homogeneous steady states. We then use these results to investigate the effect of two social interactions (attraction and alignment) on the structure of stationary and moving animal groups. While attraction makes the groups more compact, alignment has a dual effect, depending on whether the groups are stationary or moving. More precisely, increasing alignment makes the stationary groups compact, and the moving groups more elongated. Also, the results show the existence of a threshold for the total group density, above which, coordinated behaviors described by stationary and moving groups persist for a long time.","R.

Next, the dynamic contact pressure is solved by employing the perturbation method. Lastly, the dynamic contact stiffness with different dynamic contact displacement conditions is derived for the FGM coated half-space.

This relates to the more usual approximation by a rational function in that it could imply how many decimal places are needed when applying a particularly good rational function approximation having non-integrad coefficients.It is shown how to obtain “good” approximations of this type and it is also shown how under certain circumstances “very good” bounds are not possible. As in diophantine approximation this means that many merely “good” approximations do exist, which may be the preferable case. The existence or nonexistence of “very good” approximations is closely related to the diophantine approximation of the first nonzero power series coefficient of at z=0.

Our approach consists in reducing the problems to the study of renewal shifts. We also describe applications of this approach to hyperbolic horseshoes as well as to noninvertible maps, both parabolic (with the Manneville-Pomeau map) and uniformly expanding. This allows us to recover in a unified manner several results scattered in the literature.

1489,Clustering Binary Oligonucleotide Fingerprint Vectors for DNA Clone Classification Analysis,"We considered the problem of clustering binarized oligonucleotide fingerprints that attempts to identify clusters. Oligonucleotide fingerprinting is a powerful DNA array based method to characterize cDNA and rRNA libraries and has many applications including gene expression profiling and DNA clone classification. DNA clone classification is the main application for the problem considered in this paper. Most of the existing approaches for clustering use normalized real intensity values and thus do not treat positive and negative hybridization signals equally. This is demonstrated in a series of recent publications where a discrete approach typically useful in the classification of microbial rRNA clones has been proposed. In the discrete approach, hybridization intensities are normalized and thresholds are set such that a value of 1 represents hybridization, a value of 0 represents no hybridization, and an N represents unknown, which is also called a missing value. A combinatorial optimization problem is then formulated attempting to cluster the fingerprints and resolve the missing values simultaneously. It has been examined that missing values cause much difficulty in clustering analysis and most clustering methods are very sensitive to them. In this paper, we turned a little back to the traditional clustering problem, which takes in no missing values but with the revised goal to stabilize the number of clusters and maintain the clustering quality. We adopted the binarizing scheme used in the discrete approach as it is shown to be typically useful for the clone classifications. We formulated such a problem into another combinatorial optimization problem. The computational complexity of this new clustering problem and its relationships to the discrete approach and the traditional clustering problem were studied. We have designed an exact algorithm for the new clustering problem, which is an A* search algorithm for finding a minimum number of clusters. The experimental results on two commonly tested real datasets demonstrated that the A* search algorithm runs fast and performs better than some popular hierarchical clustering methods, in terms of separating clones that have different characteristics with respect to the given oligonucleotide probes.","Zhipeng Cai1, Maysam Heydari1 & Guohui Lin",Journal of Combinatorial Optimization,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10878-005-6857-3,"DNA array,oligonucleotide fingerprinting,DNA clone classification,clustering,combinatorial optimization,A* search,evaluation function"

1500,A stochastic analysis of autoregulation of gene expression,"This paper analyzes, in the context of a prokaryotic cell, the stochastic variability of the number of proteins when there is a control of gene expression by an autoregulation scheme. The goal of this work is to estimate the efficiency of the regulation to limit the fluctuations of the number of copies of a given protein. The autoregulation considered in this paper relies mainly on a negative feedback: the proteins are repressors of their own gene expression. The efficiency of a production process without feedback control is compared to a production process with an autoregulation of the gene expression assuming that both of them produce the same average number of proteins. The main characteristic used for the comparison is the standard deviation of the number of proteins at equilibrium. With a Markovian representation and a simple model of repression, we prove that, under a scaling regime, the repression mechanism follows a Hill repression scheme with an hyperbolic control. An explicit asymptotic expression of the variance of the number of proteins under this regulation mechanism is obtained. Simulations are used to study other aspects of autoregulation such as the rate of convergence to equilibrium of the production process and the case where the control of the production process of proteins is achieved via the inhibition of mRNAs.","Renaud Dessalles1,2, Vincent Fromion1 & Philippe Robert

In particular, we indicate effectively verifiable sufficient conditions of properness and list general geometric properties of the nonproperness set. We also establish basic geometric properties of proper homogeneous and quadratic mappings. Special attention is given to stable quadratic mappings. Namely, we give estimates for various topological invariants of their fibers and give a complete description of the possible topological structure of fibers in a number of cases.

We prove that there does not exist a complete Hopf real hypersurface in a non-flat complex space form satisfying Fischer–Marsden equation. Finally, we show that a complete real hypersurface with \(A\xi =\alpha \xi \), \(\alpha \ne 0\), of a complex Euclidean space \({\mathbb {C}}^n\) satisfying Fischer–Marsden equation is locally congruent to a sphere or \({\mathbb {S}}^1 \times {\mathbb {R}}^{2n-2}\).","V.

1505,Explicit Real-Part Estimates for High Order Derivatives of Analytic Functions,"The representation for the sharp constant \(\mathrm{K}_{n, p}\) in an estimate of the modulus of the n-th derivative of an analytic function in the upper half-plane \({\mathbb C}_+\) is considered in this paper. It is assumed that the boundary value of the real part of the function on \(\partial {\mathbb C}_+\) belongs to \(L^p\). The representation for \(\mathrm{K}_{n, p}\) implies an optimization problem for a parameter in some integral. This problem is solved for \(p=2(m+1)/(2m+1-n)\), \(n\le 2m+1\), and for some first derivatives of even order in the case \(p=\infty \). The formula for \(\mathrm{K}_{n, 2(m+1)/(2m+1-n)}\) contains, for instance, the known expressions for \(\mathrm{K}_{2m+1, \infty }\) and \(\mathrm{K}_{m, 2}\) as particular cases. Also, a two-sided estimate for \(\mathrm{K}_{2m, \infty }\) is derived, which leads to the asymptotic formula \(\mathrm{K}_{2m, \infty }=2((2m-1))^2/\pi + O(((2m-1))^2/(2m-1))\) as \(m \rightarrow \infty \). The lower and upper bounds of \(\mathrm{K}_{2m, \infty }\) are compared with its value for the cases \(m=1, 2, 3, 4\).

These are solved for the leading modes—eigenvalues of algebraically largest real part, and their eigenvectors—by a flexible method assembled from the iterative Arnoldi algorithm with Schur-Wielandt deflation developed by Saad for the asymmetric eigenproblem; initialization that takes advantage of continuation and can incorporate rational acceleration; complex or real shift of eigenvalue, as appropriate; and—a key ingredient-approximately exponential preconditioning by rational transformation suitable to the singular behavior.

modular real-time systems with exact task execution time","This study presents a novel discrete-event systems (DES) modeling
framework to address real-time system (RTS) with sporadic, periodic, and
non-repetitive real-time tasks. Our approach is organized in three steps. First, the
effect of individual timing parameters of each task, such as job arrival and
deadlines, are represented by modular DES. Second, we choose the required modules
for the specific RTS at hand to compose an overall model. Third, we utilize
supervisory control to find all schedules that are consistent with the timing
requirements of all tasks. In contrast to fixed task priorities, we address general
preemption relations represented by a preemption matrix and thereby implement
priority-free conditionally-preemptive (PFCP) real-time scheduling. As a particular
feature of the closed-loop configuration, the schedules obtained refer to the actual
job execution time as opposed to upper and lower bounds. We illustrate our approach
by a real-world example in the context of an automated manufacturing system.","Xi Wang1,2, Zhiwu Li

An iterative algorithm is constructed and the sequence of the algorithm is proved to converge strongly to a solution of the Hammerstein equation \(u+KFu=0\). This theorem is a significant improvement of some important recent results which were proved in real Hilbert spaces under the assumption that F and K are maximal monotone continuous and bounded. The continuity and boundedness restrictions on K and F have been dispensed with, using our new method, even in the more general setting considered in our theorems.

With \(T=\sum \tfrac{Q_k(x)}{k!}D^k\), we seek to understand the behavior of the transformation T by studying the roots of the \(Q_k(x)\). We prove four main things. First, we show that the only case where the \(Q_k(x)\) are constant and \(\{P_n(x)\}\) is an orthogonal system is when the \(P_n(x)\) form a shifted set of generalized probabilist Hermite polynomials. Second, we show that the coefficient polynomials \(Q_k(x)\) have real roots when the \(P_n(x)\) are the physicist Hermite polynomials or the Laguerre polynomials. Next, we show that in these cases, the roots of successive polynomials strictly interlace, a property that has not yet been studied for coefficient polynomials. We conclude by discussing the Chebyshev and Legendre polynomials, proving a conjecture of Chasse, and presenting several open problems.","David A. Cardon1, Evan L. Sorensen2 & Jason C.

1512,Matrix biorthogonal polynomials on the real line: Geronimus transformations,"In this paper Geronimus transformations for matrix orthogonal polynomials in the real line are studied. The orthogonality is understood in a broad sense, and is given in terms of a nondegenerate continuous sesquilinear form, which in turn is determined by a quasidefinite matrix of bivariate generalized functions with a well defined support. The discussion of the orthogonality for such a sesquilinear form includes, among others, matrix Hankel cases with linear functionals, general matrix Sobolev orthogonality and discrete orthogonal polynomials with an infinite support. The results are mainly concerned with the derivation of Christoffel type formulas, which allow to express the perturbed matrix biorthogonal polynomials and its norms in terms of the original ones. The basic tool is the Gauss–Borel factorization of the Gram matrix, and particular attention is paid to the non-associative character, in general, of the product of semi-infinite matrices. The Geronimus transformation, in where a right multiplication by the inverse of a matrix polynomial and an addition of adequate masses is performed, is considered. The resolvent matrix and connection formulas are given. Two different methods are developed. A spectral one, based on the spectral properties of the perturbing polynomial, and constructed in terms of the second kind functions. This approach requires the perturbing matrix polynomial to have a nonsingular leading term. Then, using spectral techniques and spectral jets, Christoffel–Geronimus formulas for the transformed polynomials and norms are presented. For this type of transformations, the paper also proposes an alternative method, which does not require of spectral techniques, that is valid also for singular leading coefficients. When the leading term is nonsingular a comparative of between both methods is presented. The nonspectral method is applied to unimodular Christoffel perturbations, and a simple example for a degree one massless Geronimus perturbation is given.","Gerardo Ariznabarreta1, Juan C.

The applicability of the method ranges from orthogonal polynomials (and generalizations) to Painlevé transcendents, and integrable wave equations (KdV, NonLinear Schrödinger, etc.). For the case of asymptotics of generalized orthogonal polynomials with respect to varying complex weights we can recast the requirements for the Cauchy-transform of the equilibrium measure into a problem of algebraic geometry and harmonic analysis and completely solve the existence and uniqueness issue without relying on the minimization of a functional. This addresses and solves also the issue of the “free boundary problem"", determining implicitly the curves where the zeroes of the orthogonal polynomials accumulate in the limit of large degrees and the support of the measure. The relevance to the quasi-linear Stokes phenomenon for Painlevé equations is indicated. A numerical algorithm to find these curves in some cases is also explained.","M.

1515,Stable Phaseless Sampling and Reconstruction of Real-Valued Signals with Finite Rate of Innovation,"A spatial signal is defined by its evaluations on the whole domain. In this paper, we consider stable reconstruction of real-valued signals with finite rate of innovation (FRI), up to a sign, from their magnitude measurements on the whole domain or their phaseless samples on a discrete subset. FRI signals appear in many engineering applications such as magnetic resonance spectrum, ultra wide-band communication and electrocardiogram. For an FRI signal, we introduce an undirected graph to describe its topological structure, establish the equivalence between its graph connectivity and its phase retrievability by point evaluation measurements on the whole domain, apply the graph connected component decomposition to find its unique landscape decomposition and the set of FRI signals that have the same magnitude measurements. We construct discrete sets with finite density so that magnitude measurements of an FRI signal on the whole domain are determined by its phaseless samples taken on those discrete subsets, and we show that the corresponding phaseless sampling procedure has bi-Lipschitz property with respect to a new induced metric on the signal space and the standard \(\ell ^{p}\)-metric on the sampling data set. In this paper, we also propose an algorithm with linear complexity to reconstruct an FRI signal from its (un)corrupted phaseless samples on the above sampling set without restriction on the noise level and apriori information whether the original FRI signal is phase retrievable. The algorithm is theoretically guaranteed to be stable, and numerically demonstrated to approximate the original FRI signal in magnitude measurements.","Cheng Cheng

Our proposed method is of viscosity-type and converges strongly to a solution of the aforementioned problem when the underlying/cost operator is pseudo-monotone and uniformly continuous; this makes our method to be potentially more applicable than most existing methods in the literature. To support our results numerically, we considered some examples in both finite and infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces and compared our results with other existing results in the literature.

The objective of this research is to propose two new iterative methods with inertial effect to solve equilibrium problems. These iterative methods are based on an extra-gradient method and a Mann-type iterative method. Two strong convergence theorems have been proved in the setting of real Hilbert space, with mild assumptions that the underlying bi-function is Lipschitz-type continuous and pseudo-monotone. The primary advantage of the second method is that it does not require the information of the Lipschitz-type bi-functional constants. We have also studied the applications of our research results to solve particular classes of equilibrium problems. Numerical studies are carried out to show the behaviour of proposed methods and to compare them with the existing ones in the literature.

Little is known so far for simple abelian surfaces of higher Picard number. In this paper we investigate principally polarized abelian surfaces with real multiplication. They are of Picard number two and might be considered the next natural case to be studied. The challenge is to not only determine the Seshadri constants of individual line bundles, but to understand the whole Seshadri function on these surfaces. Our results show on the one hand that this function is surprisingly complex: on surfaces with real multiplication in \(\mathbb {Z}[\sqrt{e}]\) it consists of linear segments that are never adjacent to each other—it behaves like the Cantor function. On the other hand, we prove that the Seshadri function is invariant under an infinite group of automorphisms, which shows that it does have interesting regular behavior globally.",Thomas Bauer1 & Maximilian Schmidt,Mathematische Zeitschrift,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00209-021-02884-7,"Abelian surface,Seshadri constant,Real multiplication,Cantor function"

1522,"Heterogeneous network epidemics: real-time growth, variance and extinction of infection","Recent years have seen a large amount of interest in epidemics on networks as a way of representing the complex structure of contacts capable of spreading infections through the modern human population. The configuration model is a popular choice in theoretical studies since it combines the ability to specify the distribution of the number of contacts (degree) with analytical tractability. Here we consider the early real-time behaviour of the Markovian SIR epidemic model on a configuration model network using a multitype branching process. We find closed-form analytic expressions for the mean and variance of the number of infectious individuals as a function of time and the degree of the initially infected individual(s), and write down a system of differential equations for the probability of extinction by time t that are numerically fast compared to Monte Carlo simulation. We show that these quantities are all sensitive to the degree distribution—in particular we confirm that the mean prevalence of infection depends on the first two moments of the degree distribution and the variance in prevalence depends on the first three moments of the degree distribution. In contrast to most existing analytic approaches, the accuracy of these results does not depend on having a large number of infectious individuals, meaning that in the large population limit they would be asymptotically exact even for one initial infectious individual.","Frank Ball

1524,Controlling transient gas flow in real-world pipeline intersection areas,"Compressor stations are the heart of every high-pressure gas transport network. Located at intersection areas of the network, they are contained in huge complex plants, where they are in combination with valves and regulators responsible for routing and pushing the gas through the network. Due to their complexity and lack of data compressor stations are usually dealt with in the scientific literature in a highly simplified and idealized manner. As part of an ongoing project with one of Germany’s largest transmission system operators to develop a decision support system for their dispatching center, we investigated how to automatize the control of compressor stations. Each station has to be in a particular configuration, leading in combination with the other nearby elements to a discrete set of up to 2000 possible feasible operation modes in the intersection area. Since the desired performance of the station changes over time, the configuration of the station has to adapt. Our goal is to minimize the necessary changes in the overall operation modes and related elements over time while fulfilling a preset performance envelope or demand scenario. This article describes the chosen model and the implemented mixed-integer programming based algorithms to tackle this challenge. By presenting extensive computational results on real-world data, we demonstrate the performance of our approach.","Felix Hennings

1527,Quantum modular invariant and Hilbert class fields of real quadratic global function fields,"This is the first of a series of two papers in which we present a solution to Manin’s Real Multiplication program (Manin in: Laudal and Piene (eds) The Legacy of Niels Henrik Abel, Springer, Berlin, 2004) —an approach to Hilbert’s 12th problem for real quadratic extensions of \(\mathbb Q\)—in positive characteristic, using quantum analogs of the modular invariant and the exponential function. In this first paper, we treat the problem of Hilbert class field generation. If \(k=\mathbb F_{q}(T)\) and \(k_{\infty }\) is the analytic completion of k, we introduce the quantum modular invariant $$\begin{aligned} j^\mathrm{qt}: k_{\infty }\multimap k_{\infty } \end{aligned}$$as a multivalued, discontinuous modular invariant function. Then if \(K=k(f)\subset k_{\infty }\) is a real quadratic extension of k and f is a fundamental unit, we show that the Hilbert class field \(H_{\mathcal {O}_{K}}\) (associated to \(\mathcal {O}_{K}=\) integral closure of \(\mathbb F_{q}[T]\) in K) is generated over K by the product of the multivalues of \(j^\mathrm{qt}(f)\).

1529,Real-time heuristic algorithms for the static weapon target assignment problem,"The problem of targeting and engaging individual missiles (targets) with an arsenal of interceptors (weapons) is known as the weapon target assignment problem. Many optimal solution techniques are applied to solve problem variants having linear approximations of the objective function, and their final solutions rarely yield optimal solutions to the original problem. Herein, we propose a nonlinear branch and bound algorithm to solve the untransformed problem. We also develop two heuristics respectively based on a branch and bound algorithm and the optimal solution to the quiz problem, and we compare them to a well-embraced heuristic from the literature. We test the three heuristics to solve a set of 15 problem sizes and 20 instances for each size, comparing their performance with respect to solution quality and required computational effort. The heuristic based upon the optimal solution to the quiz problem finds solutions within \(6\%\) of optimal for small problems and provides statistically similar results as one of the best heuristics found in the literature for larger problems, while solving these problems in ten thousandths of the time.","Alexander G.

1530,A new matrix perturbation method for analytical solution of the complex modal eigenvalue problem of viscously damped linear vibration systems,"A new matrix perturbation analysis method is presented for efficient approximate solution of the complex modal quadratic generalized eigenvalue problem of viscously damped linear vibration systems. First, the damping matrix is decomposed into the sum of a proportional- and a nonproportional-damping parts, and the solutions of the real modal eigenproblem with the proportional dampings are determined, which are a set of initial approximate solutions of the complex modal eigenproblem. Second, by taking the nonproportional-damping part as a small modification to the proportional one and using the matrix perturbation analysis method, a set of approximate solutions of the complex modal eigenvalue problem can be obtained analytically. The result is quite simple. The new method is applicable to the systems with viscous dampings which do not deviate far away from the proportional- damping case. It is particularly important that the solution technique be also effective to the systems with heavy, but not over, dampings. The solution formulas of complex modal eigenvlaues and eigenvectors are derived up to second- order perturbation terms. The effectiveness of the perturbation algorithm is illustrated by an exemplar numerical problem with heavy dampings. In addition, the practicability of approximately estimating the complex modal eigenvalues, under the proportional-damping hypothesis, of damped vibration systems is discussed by several numerical examples.","Lü Zhen-hua1, Feng Zhen-dong1 & Fang Chuan-liu",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,1991,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02458167,"vibration analysis,damped system,complex mode,quadratic eigenvalue problem,matrix perturbation method"
1531,On the equivalence of complex and quaternionic quantum mechanics,"Due to the existence of incompatible observables, the propositional calculus of a quantum system does not form a Boolean algebra, but an orthomodular lattice. Such lattice can be realised as a lattice of subspaces on a real, complex or quaternionic Hilbert space, which motivated the formulation of real and quaternionic quantum mechanics in addition to the usual complex formulation. It was argued that any real quantum system admits a complex structure that turns it into a complex quantum system and hence real quantum mechanics was soon discarded. Several authors, however, developed a quaternionic version of quantum mechanics and this version did not seem to be equivalent to the standard formulation on a complex Hilbert space. Motivated by some recently developed techniques from quaternionic operator theory, we conjecture in this article that this not correct and that showing the equivalence of real and complex quantum mechanics and the equivalence of complex and quaternionic quantum mechanics are dual problems that can be solved with the same techniques. We furthermore suggest that any quaternionic quantum system is actually simply the quaternionification of a complex quantum system and we show that this conjecture holds true for quaternionic relativistic elementary systems by applying some recent arguments that were used to show the equivalence of real and complex relativistic elementary systems. Finally, we conclude by discussing how the misconception that complex and quaternionic quantum mechanics are inequivalent arose from assuming the existence of a left multiplication on the Hilbert space, which is physically not justified.","Jonathan Gantner

1534,Optimized Schwarz waveform relaxation for advection reaction diffusion equations in two dimensions,"Optimized Schwarz waveform relaxation methods have been developed over the last decade for the parallel solution of evolution problems. They are based on a decomposition in space and an iteration, where only subproblems in space-time need to be solved. Each subproblem can be simulated using an adapted numerical method, for example with local time stepping, or one can even use a different model in different subdomains, which makes these methods very suitable also from a modeling point of view. For rapid convergence however, it is important to use effective transmission conditions between the space-time subdomains, and for best performance, these transmission conditions need to take the physics of the underlying evolution problem into account. The optimization of these transmission conditions leads to mathematically hard best approximation problems of homographic functions. We study in this paper in detail the best approximation problem for the case of linear advection reaction diffusion equations in two spatial dimensions. We prove comprehensively best approximation results for transmission conditions of Robin and Ventcel (higher order) type, which can also be used in the various limits for example for the heat equation, since we include in our analysis a positive low frequency limiter both in space and time. We give for each case closed form asymptotic values for the parameters which can directly be used in implementations of these algorithms, and which guarantee asymptotically best performance of the iterative methods. We finally show extensive numerical experiments, including cases not covered by our analysis, for example decompositions with cross points. We use Q1 finite element discretizations in space and Forward and Backward Euler discretizations in time (other discretization could also have been considered, since all our analysis is at the continuous level), and in all cases, we measure performance corresponding to our analysis.","Daniel Bennequin1, Martin J.

This question appears at first somewhat surprising since “model” is such a standard term now in the discourse on mathematics and “modelling” such a standard activity that it seems to be well established since long. The paper shows that the term— in the intended epistemological meaning—emerged rather recently and tries to reveal in which mathematical contexts it became established. The paper discusses various layers of argumentations and reflections in order to unravel and reach the pertinent kernel of the issue. The specific points of this paper are the difference in the epistemological concept to the usually discussed notions of model and the difference between conceptions implied in mathematical practices and their becoming conscious in proper reflections of mathematicians.,"Gert Schubring

1547,Dynamic metaplectic spinor quantization: the projective correspondence for spectral dual pairs,"From the historical perspective, the technique of X-ray computer tomography featured the predecessor of magnetic spin resonance tomography, which in fact is a non-invasive, high resolution, biomedical diagnostic scanning modality. Based on non-commutative harmonic analysis on the classical (2 + 1)-dimensional real Heisenberg unipotent Lie group \(\mathcal{N}\) and the gradient controlled inversive and co-inversive chord-contact dynamics, framed by the coadjoint \(\mathcal{N}\)-orbit model inside the real dual vector space \(\mathfrak {Lie}(\mathcal{N})^*\), the paper provides mathematical insight into the intrinsic electromagnetic quantum field and relativistic symmetries associated to the highly resolving clinical modality of magnetic spin resonance tomography by referring to the methodology of the basic control mechanisms of the projective duality correspondence for spectral dual pairs of real Lie groups. In terms of the projective manifold \({\mathbb {P}}_{\mathbb {C}}\left( \mathfrak {Lie}(\mathcal{N})^*\right) \cong {\mathbb {P}}_3({\mathbb {C}})\), which is associated with the (2 + 1)-dimensional dual vector space \(\mathfrak {Lie}(\mathcal{N})^*\) of the real Heisenberg nilpotent Lie algebra \(\mathfrak {Lie}(\mathcal{N})\), the smooth line bundle technique of dynamic metaplectic spinor quantization leads to the twisted action of the metaplectic Lie group \(\mathrm{Mp}(2,{\mathbb {R}}) = \widetilde{\mathrm{Sp}}(2,{\mathbb {R}})\). The transitive proper hyperbolic-parabolically ruled gradient action of the projective Lorentz–Möbius Lie group \(\mathrm{PSO}(1,3,{\mathbb {R}})\) on \({\mathbb {P}}_{\mathbb {C}}\left( \mathfrak {Lie}(\mathcal{N})^*\right) \) torque-records dihedrally its spectral incidence projective curve, the plane cubic \(E({\mathbb {C}}) \hookrightarrow {\mathbb {P}}_2({\mathbb {C}}) \cong \mathrm{Sym}^2\left( {\mathbb {P}}_1({\mathbb {C}})\right) \), on the two-dimensional pages of the open-book foliation inside the very round sphere \({\mathbb {S}}_3 \cong \mathrm{Spin}(3,{\mathbb {R}}) \cong \mathrm{SU}(2,{\mathbb {C}}) \hookrightarrow {\mathbb {P}}_{\mathbb {C}}\left( \mathfrak {Lie}(\mathcal{N})^*\right) \) with angular momentum axis of the driving central universal Casimir metaplectic spinor. The projective correspondence for the spectral dual pair \(\left( \mathrm{Mp}(2,{\mathbb {R}}),\mathrm{PSO}(1,3,{\mathbb {R}})\right) \) provides an efficient mathematical approach to the high resolution imaging modalities of magnetic spin resonance tomography, optical or ocular coherence tomography of neuro-ophthalmology, spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, and the quantum field phenomena of the Hanbury Brown–Twiss experiment for photons and electrons. Due to the Eisenstein meromorphic calculus, the omni-directional interferometric detection of gravitational wavepackets of two polarizations is tomographically performed by the Abel–Jacobi inversion of the relativistic parabolic porism deviation of Kepplerian bifocal periodicity with its metaplectic spinor driven pair \((\sigma ,{\bar{\sigma }})\) of projective tangent involutions in the space \({\mathbb {P}}_{\mathbb {C}}\left( \mathfrak {Lie}(\mathcal{N})^*\right) \). The astrophysical emission of gravitational radiation is closely related to the concept of simply connected horned sphere which is homeomorphic to the compact base manifold of the Hopf principal circle bundle \({\mathbb {S}}_1 \hookrightarrow {\mathbb {S}}_3 {\mathop {\longrightarrow }\limits ^{\eta }} {\mathbb {S}}_2\).

1551,On H. Weyl and J. Steiner Polynomials,"The paper deals with root location problems for two classes of univariate polynomials both of geometric origin. The first class discussed, the class of Steiner polynomial, consists of polynomials, each associated with a compact convex set \(V \subset {\mathbb{R}}^{n}\). A polynomial of this class describes the volume of the set V + tB
n as a function of t, where t is a positive number and B
n denotes the unit ball in \({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\). The second class, the class of Weyl polynomials, consists of polynomials, each associated with a Riemannian manifold \({\mathcal{M}}\) , where \({\mathcal{M}}\) is isometrically embedded with positive codimension in \({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\). A Weyl polynomial describes the volume of a tubular neighborhood of its associated \({\mathcal{M}}\) as a function of the tube’s radius. These polynomials are calculated explicitly in a number of natural examples such as balls, cubes, squeezed cylinders. Furthermore, we examine how the above mentioned polynomials are related to one another and how they depend on the standard embedding of \({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\) into \({\mathbb{R}}^{m}\) for m > n. We find that in some cases the real part of any Steiner polynomial root will be negative. In certain other cases, a Steiner polynomial will have only real negative roots. In all of this cases, it can be shown that all of a Weyl polynomial’s roots are simple and, furthermore, that they lie on the imaginary axis. At the same time, in certain cases the above pattern does not hold.

1552,Time quasi-periodic gravity water waves in finite depth,"We prove the existence and the linear stability of Cantor families of small amplitude time quasi-periodic standing water wave solutions—namely periodic and even in the space variable x—of a bi-dimensional ocean with finite depth under the action of pure gravity. Such a result holds for all the values of the depth parameter in a Borel set of asymptotically full measure. This is a small divisor problem. The main difficulties are the fully nonlinear nature of the gravity water waves equations—the highest order x-derivative appears in the nonlinear term but not in the linearization at the origin—and the fact that the linear frequencies grow just in a sublinear way at infinity. We overcome these problems by first reducing the linearized operators, obtained at each approximate quasi-periodic solution along a Nash–Moser iterative scheme, to constant coefficients up to smoothing operators, using pseudo-differential changes of variables that are quasi-periodic in time. Then we apply a KAM reducibility scheme which requires very weak Melnikov non-resonance conditions which lose derivatives both in time and space. Despite the fact that the depth parameter moves the linear frequencies by just exponentially small quantities, we are able to verify such non-resonance conditions for most values of the depth, extending degenerate KAM theory.","Pietro Baldi1, Massimiliano Berti2, Emanuele Haus1 & …Riccardo Montalto",Inventiones mathematicae,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-018-0812-2,"76B15,37K55 (37C55, 35S05)"
1553,Analysis of multiple scattering iterations for high-frequency scattering problems. II: The three-dimensional scalar case,"In this paper, we continue our analysis of the treatment of multiple scattering effects within a recently proposed methodology, based on integral-equations, for the numerical solution of scattering problems at high frequencies. In more detail, here we extend the two-dimensional results in part I of this work to fully three-dimensional geometries. As in the former case, our concern here is the determination of the rate of convergence of the multiple-scattering iterations for a collection of three-dimensional convex obstacles that are inherent in the aforementioned high-frequency schemes. To this end, we follow a similar strategy to that we devised in part I: first, we recast the (iterated, Neumann) multiple-scattering series in the form of a sum of periodic orbits (of increasing period) corresponding to multiple reflections that periodically bounce off a series of scattering sub-structures; then, we proceed to derive a high-frequency recurrence that relates the normal derivatives of the fields induced on these structures as the waves reflect periodically; and, finally, we analyze this recurrence to provide an explicit rate of convergence associated with each orbit. While the procedure is analogous to its two-dimensional counterpart, the actual analysis is significantly more involved and, perhaps more interestingly, it uncovers new phenomena that cannot be distinguished in two-dimensional configurations (e.g. the further dependence of the convergence rate on the relative orientation of interacting structures). As in the two-dimensional case, and beyond their intrinsic interest, we also explain here how the results of our analysis can be used to accelerate the convergence of the multiple-scattering series and, thus, to provide significant savings in computational times.","Akash Anand1, Yassine Boubendir2, Fatih Ecevit3 & …Fernando Reitich",Numerische Mathematik,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-009-0263-1,"Primary: 65N38,Secondary: 45M05,35P25,65B99"

We characterize when such operators are power bounded, i.e. when the orbits of all the elements are bounded. In this case this condition is equivalent to the composition operator being mean ergodic. In particular, we show that the composition operator is power bounded on the space of real analytic functions on Ω if and only if there is a basis of complex neighbourhoods U of Ω such that the operator is an endomorphism on the space of holomorphic functions on each U.",José Bonet1 & Paweł Domański,Collectanea mathematica,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13348-010-0005-9,"Spaces of real analytic functions,Real analytic manifold,Composition operator,Mean ergodic operator,Power bounded operator,Orbit,Hypercyclic operator,Hyperbolic spaces"
1556,"Epidemic growth rate and household reproduction number in communities of households, schools and workplaces","In this paper we present a novel and coherent modelling framework for the characterisation of the real-time growth rate in SIR models of epidemic spread in populations with social structures of increasing complexity. Known results about homogeneous mixing and multitype models are included in the framework, which is then extended to models with households and models with households and schools/workplaces. Efficient methods for the exact computation of the real-time growth rate are presented for the standard SIR model with constant infection and recovery rates (Markovian case). Approximate methods are described for a large class of models with time-varying infection rates (non-Markovian case). The quality of the approximation is assessed via comparison with results from individual-based stochastic simulations. The methodology is then applied to the case of influenza in models with households and schools/workplaces, to provide an estimate of a household-to-household reproduction number and thus asses the effort required to prevent an outbreak by targeting control policies at the level of households. The results highlight the risk of underestimating such effort when the additional presence of schools/workplaces is neglected. Our framework increases the applicability of models of epidemic spread in socially structured population by linking earlier theoretical results, mainly focused on time-independent key epidemiological parameters (e.g. reproduction numbers, critical vaccination coverage, epidemic final size) to new results on the epidemic dynamics.","Lorenzo Pellis1, Neil M.

This paper includes eight sections. Section 1 is a longer introduction, which gives a brief introduction to random metric theory, risk measures and conditional risk measures. Section 2 gives the central framework in random metric theory, topological structures, important examples, the notions of a random conjugate space and the Hahn-Banach theorems for random linear functionals. Section 3 gives several important representation theorems for random conjugate spaces. Section 4 gives characterizations for a complete random normed module to be random reflexive.

1558,Using Machine Learning to Improve Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition,"Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) is a key tool in computational algebraic geometry, best known as a procedure to enable Quantifier Elimination over real-closed fields. However, it has a worst case complexity doubly exponential in the size of the input, which is often encountered in practice. It has been observed that for many problems a change in algorithm settings or problem formulation can cause huge differences in runtime costs, changing problem instances from intractable to easy. A number of heuristics have been developed to help with such choices, but the complicated nature of the geometric relationships involved means these are imperfect and can sometimes make poor choices. We investigate the use of machine learning (specifically support vector machines) to make such choices instead. Machine learning is the process of fitting a computer model to a complex function based on properties learned from measured data. In this paper we apply it in two case studies: the first to select between heuristics for choosing a CAD variable ordering; the second to identify when a CAD problem instance would benefit from Gröbner Basis preconditioning. These appear to be the first such applications of machine learning to Symbolic Computation. We demonstrate in both cases that the machine learned choice outperforms human developed heuristics.","Zongyan Huang1, Matthew England2, David J. Wilson3, James Bridge1, James H.

1559,Integrability and Linear Stability of Nonlinear Waves,"It is well known that the linear stability of solutions of \(1+1\) partial differential equations which are integrable can be very efficiently investigated by means of spectral methods. We present here a direct construction of the eigenmodes of the linearized equation which makes use only of the associated Lax pair with no reference to spectral data and boundary conditions. This local construction is given in the general \(N\times N\) matrix scheme so as to be applicable to a large class of integrable equations, including the multicomponent nonlinear Schrödinger system and the multiwave resonant interaction system. The analytical and numerical computations involved in this general approach are detailed as an example for \(N=3\) for the particular system of two coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations in the defocusing, focusing and mixed regimes. The instabilities of the continuous wave solutions are fully discussed in the entire parameter space of their amplitudes and wave numbers. By defining and computing the spectrum in the complex plane of the spectral variable, the eigenfrequencies are explicitly expressed. According to their topological properties, the complete classification of these spectra in the parameter space is presented and graphically displayed. The continuous wave solutions are linearly unstable for a generic choice of the coupling constants.","Antonio Degasperis1, Sara Lombardo

Dick Askey (private communication) suggested that the “Bessel-type orthogonality” found in Ismail et al.

1561,On the relation between measurement outcomes and physical properties,"One of the most difficult problems in quantum mechanics is the analysis of the measurement processes. In this paper, we point out that many of these difficulties originate from the different roles of measurement outcomes and observable quantities, which cannot simply be identified with each other. Our analysis shows that the Hilbert space formalism itself describes a fundamental separation between quantitative properties and qualitative outcomes that needs to be taken into account in an objective description of quantum measurements. We derive fundamental relations between the statistics of measurement outcomes and the values of physical quantities that explain how the objective properties of a quantum system appear in the context of different measurement interactions. Our results indicate that non-classical correlations can be understood in terms of the actual role of physical properties as quantifiable causes of the external effects observed in a quantum measurement.","Taiki Nii1, Masataka Iinuma1 & Holger F.

Three levels in the resolution processes are distinguished and emphasized in this expository-research paper: philosophy of resolution, regularization–approximation schema, and regularization algorithms. Dilemmas and methodologies of resolution of ill-posed problems and their numerical implementations are examined with particular reference to the problem of finding numerically minimum weighted-norm least squares solutions of first kind integral equations (and more generally of linear operator equations with non-closed range). An emphasis is placed on the role of constraints, function space methods, the role of generalized inverses, and reproducing kernels in the regularization and stable computational resolution of these problems.

1566,"Complex Network Analysis of the Robustness of the Hanoi, Vietnam Bus Network","Many complex networks exist to facilitate the transport of material or information. In this capacity, the authors are often concerned with the continued flow of material or information when a fraction of the links in the complex network is disrupted. In other words, the authors are interested in the robustness of the complex network. In this paper, the authors survey measures of robustness like the average path length, the average clustering coefficient, the global efficiency, the size of largest cluster and use these to analyze the robustness of the bus network in Hanoi, Vietnam. The authors find that the bus network is robust against random failure but sensitive to targeted attack, in agreement with its scale-free character. By examining sharp drops in the average path length within the largest cluster of the Hanoi bus network under successive targeted attack, the authors identify five nodes whose loss lead to the fragmentation of the network into five or six disconnected clusters. These isolated clusters represent geographically the Central, Western, Southern, and Northwestern districts of Hanoi. Special considerations must therefore be given to these five nodes when planners wish to expand the bus network, or make it more robust.","Vu Hieu Tran1, Siew Ann Cheong2 & Ngoc Dung Bui",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-019-7431-x,"Complex network,hanoi bus network,random failure,robustness,targeted attack"
1567,Modeling and dynamic analysis of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) in China,"Although novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) was widely spread in mainland China in early 2020, it was soon controlled. To study the impact of government interventions on the spread of disease during epidemics, a differential equation system is established to simulate the process of virus propagation in this paper. We first analyze its basic properties, basic reproduction number \(R_{0}\) and existence of equilibria. Then we prove that the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is Globally Asymptotically Stable when \(R_{0}\) is less than 1. Through the analysis of the daily epidemic data from January 10, 2020 to March 11, 2020, combined with the implementation of the national epidemic policy, we divide the whole process into three stages: the first stage (natural state), the second stage (isolation state), the third stage (isolation, detection and treatment). By using the weighted nonlinear least square method to fit the data of three stages, the parameters are obtained, and three basic reproduction numbers are calculated, which are: \(R_{01} =2.6735\), \(R_{02} = 0.85077\), \(R_{03} = 0.18249\). Sensitivity analysis of threshold parameters and corresponding graphical results were also performed to examine the relative importance of various model parameters to the spread and prevalence of COVID-19. Finally, we simulate the trend of three stages and verify the theory of Global Asymptotic Stability of DFE. The conclusion of this paper proves theoretically that the Chinese government’s epidemic prevention measures are effective in the fight against the spread of COVID-19. This study can not only provide a reference for research methods to simulate COVID-19 transmission in other countries or regions, but also provide recommendations on COVID-19 prevention measures for them.","Youming Guo1 & Tingting Li

1569,Model Intervals,"This paper summarizes the most important results and features of Modal Interval Analysis. The ground idea of Interval mathematics is that ordinary set-theoretical intervals are the consistent context for numerical computing. However, this interval context presents basic structural and semantic rigidity arising from its set-theoretical foundation. To correct this situation, Modal Interval Analysis defines intervals starting from the identification of real numbers with the sets of predicates they accept or reject. A modal interval is defined as a pair formed by a classical interval (i.e. a set of numbers) and a quantifier, following a similar method to that in which real numbers are associated in pairs having the same absolute value but opposite signs. Two different extensions for a continuous function (called semantic extensions, since both will have a meaning thanks to the important semantic theorems) are defined and their properties are established. The definition of the rational extension, and its relationships with the semantic extensions, it make possible to compute the semantic extensions and to give a logical meaning to the interval results of a rational computations.For some functions the semantic extensions are equal, for instance, for the arithmetic operators, which can be obtained through computations with the intervals' bounds, obtaining the definitions of the well-known Kaucher's completed interval arithmetic. It is important to remark that the process of the construction of the Modal Interval Analysis is absolutely different from the process followed by Kaucher.Similarly to the Kaucher's completed interval arithmetic, with modal intervals it is possible to solve the equations A + X = B or A * X = B but with a very important difference. To find the algebraic solution for the equation A + X = B or A * X = B when A, X and B are classical intervals is a single problem: a) to find and interval X which substituted in the corresponding equation, satisfies the equality. Modal Interval Analysis not only solves that problem but also it gives a logical meaning to the solution.As a conclusion, the most important difference between Modal Interval Analysis versus Classical Intervals + Kaucher's Completed Arithmetic is the logical-semantic ground of the modal intervals and the meaning for the interval results in the functional computations or in the solution of a linear equation, provided by the semantic theorems.","Ernest Gardeñes1, Miguel Á.

1570,Analysis of a sterile insect release model with predation,"A model for the sterile insect release method of pest control in which the target species is under predatory or parasitic regulation is analyzed. The equations are nondimensionalized and the rescaled parameters are interpreted. There are four types of equilibria, whose existence and stability depend on which of ten regions of parameter space contain the rescaled parameters, and in turn give minimal release rates to achieve eradication of the pest. In at least one region, Hopf bifurcation theory shows the existence of limit cycles, but they are found to be unstable. In addition, the optimal release rate to minimize a total cost functional for pest control by the sterile release method is studied. Both approaches show that when predation accounts for a large fraction of the natural deaths, the necessary release rate and total cost are higher than for weak predation. If the predators are removed without being replaced by any other source of mortality, the cost rises in all cases but rises much more dramatically for cases with strong predation. A definite danger of the sterile release method when some predatory control exists is that the predators are frequently driven extinct before the prey, so that the target species could explode to much higher levels and be more difficult to eradicate again after the sterile release is terminated.","G.

1571,The analysis of a nested dissection algorithm,"Nested dissection is an algorithm invented by Alan George for preserving sparsity in Gaussian elimination on symmetric positive definite matrices. Nested dissection can be viewed as a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm on an undirected graph; it usesseparators in the graph, which are small sets of vertices whose removal divides the graph approximately in half. George and Liu gave an implementation of nested dissection that used a heuristic to find separators. Lipton and Tarjan gave an algorithm to findn
1/2-separators in planar graphs and two-dimensional finite element graphs, and Lipton, Rose, and Tarjan used these separators in a modified version of nested dissection, guaranteeing bounds ofO (n logn) on fill andO(n
3/2) on operation count. We analyze the combination of the original George-Liu nested dissection algorithm and the Lipton-Tarjan planar separator algorithm. This combination is interesting because it is easier to implement than the Lipton-Rose-Tarjan version, especially in the framework of existïng sparse matrix software. Using some topological graph theory, we proveO(n logn) fill andO(n
3/2) operation count bounds for planar graphs, twodimensional finite element graphs, graphs of bounded genus, and graphs of bounded degree withn
1/2-separators. For planar and finite element graphs, the leading constant factor is smaller than that in the Lipton-Rose-Tarjan analysis. We also construct a class of graphs withn

Firstly, using the harvesting as the parameter, we get the existence and stability of the positive steady state, and also investigate the existence of spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous periodic solutions. Then, by applying the normal form theory and center manifold theorem, we give the stability and direction of Hopf bifurcation from the positive steady state. In addition, we also prove the existence of the Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation. These results reveal that the harvesting and diffusion really affect the spatiotemporal complexity of the system. Finally, numerical simulations are also given to support our theoretical analysis.","Yong Wang

The best known instance of such a problem is testing for the existence of a collinear triple of points in \(A\times B\times C\), a classical 3SUM-hard problem that has so far defied any attempt to obtain a subquadratic solution, whether in the (uniform) real RAM model, or in the algebraic decision-tree model. While we are still unable to solve this problem, in full generality, in subquadratic time, we obtain such a solution, in the algebraic decision-tree model, that uses roughly \(O(n^{28/15})\) constant-degree polynomial sign tests, for the special case where two of the sets lie on two respective one-dimensional curves and the third is placed arbitrarily in the plane. Our technique is fairly general, and applies to many other problems where we seek a triple that satisfies a single polynomial equation, e.g., determining whether \(A\times B\times C\) contains a triple spanning a unit-area triangle. This result extends recent work by Barba et al. (2017) and by Chan (2018), where all three sets A, B, and C are assumed to be one-dimensional. As a second application of our technique, we again have three n-point sets A, B, and C in the plane, and we want to determine whether there exists a triple \((a,b,c) \in A\times B\times C\) that simultaneously satisfies two independent real polynomial equations. For example, this is the setup when testing for collinearity in the complex plane, when each of the sets A, B, C lies on some constant-degree algebraic curve. We show that problems of this kind can be solved with roughly \(O(n^{24/13})\) constant-degree polynomial sign tests.","Boris Aronov

1575,Mathematical model of the primary CD8 T cell immune response: stability analysis of a nonlinear age-structured system,"The primary CD8 T cell immune response, due to a first encounter with a pathogen, happens in two phases: an expansion phase, with a fast increase of T cell count, followed by a contraction phase. This contraction phase is followed by the generation of memory cells. These latter are specific of the antigen and will allow a faster and stronger response when encountering the antigen for the second time. We propose a nonlinear mathematical model describing the T CD8 immune response to a primary infection, based on three nonlinear ordinary differential equations and one nonlinear age-structured partial differential equation, describing the evolution of CD8 T cell count and pathogen amount. We discuss in particular the roles and relevance of feedback controls that regulate the response. First we reduce our system to a system with a nonlinear differential equation with a distributed delay. We study the existence of two steady states, and we analyze the asymptotic stability of these steady states. Second we study the system with a discrete delay, and analyze global asymptotic stability of steady states. Finally, we show some simulations that we can obtain from the model and confront them to experimental data.","Emmanuelle Terry1,2, Jacqueline Marvel3, Christophe Arpin3, Olivier Gandrillon2,4 & …Fabien Crauste1,",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-011-0459-8,"Immune response,CD8 T cell,Ordinary differential equations,Delay equations"
1576,Theoretical and empirical analysis of trading activity,"Understanding the structure of financial markets deals with suitably determining the functional relation between financial variables. In this respect, important variables are the trading activity, defined here as the number of trades N, the traded volume V, the asset price P, the squared volatility \(\sigma ^2\), the bid-ask spread S and the cost of trading C. Different reasonings result in simple proportionality relations (“scaling laws”) between these variables. A basic proportionality is established between the trading activity and the squared volatility, i.e., \(N \sim \sigma ^2\). More sophisticated relations are the so called 3/2-law \(N^{3/2} \sim \sigma P V /C\) and the intriguing scaling \(N \sim (\sigma P/S)^2\). We prove that these “scaling laws” are the only possible relations for considered sets of variables by means of a well-known argument from physics: dimensional analysis. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence based on data from the NASDAQ stock exchange showing that the sophisticated relations hold with a certain degree of universality. Finally, we discuss the time scaling of the volatility \(\sigma \), which turns out to be more subtle than one might naively expect.","Mathias Pohl

First, we prove that the stochastic system has a unique global positive solution. Second, by constructing a series of appropriate stochastic Lyapunov functions, the asymptotic behaviors around the equilibria of deterministic model are obtained, and we demonstrate that the stochastic system exists a stationary Markov process. Third, the conditions for persistence in the mean and extinction of the stochastic system are established.

1579,‘‘Endless’’ Workload Analysis of Large-Scale Supercomputers,"AbstractModern supercomputers are so large and complex that some of their hardware components inevitably go out of order from time to time. Therefore, supercomputer systems require constant and careful health monitoring, and such control is set up in everyday practice of any large HPC center. But a lot of attention should be also paid to the quality of supercomputer usage, describing how fully and efficiently computational resources are utilized. And this task is still far from being solved, leading to system administrators of most supercomputers knowing very little about the quality of their supercomputer job flow as well as possible ways to improve it. In this paper, we present a looped report system that allows to obtain and analyze information of any level of detail about all important aspects describing the quality of the supercomputer workload, starting from the overall system functioning and up to individual job launches. It provides great flexibility by offering an ‘‘endless’’ number of workload analysis scenarios, which allows to determine root causes of various cases of performance degradation using the same approach. This report system is built upon the previously developed TASC software package, aimed at identifying and analyzing performance issues both at the level of individual parallel applications and the entire supercomputer as a whole.","P.

In this paper, we address the issue of dealing with unknown probability distributions and investigate the robustness of such estimators with respect to possibly erroneous distribution choices. We show that infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) can be robust in this sense and, in some cases, provides distribution-independent estimates. Comparisons with other gradient estimators are provided, including experimental results. We also show that finite perturbation analysis (FPA), though only providing gradient approximations, possesses some attractive robustness properties with respect to unknown distribution parameters. An application of FPA estimation is included for a queueing system performance optimization problem involving customers with real-time constraints.","C. G. Cassandras1, W. B. Gong1 & J. I.

1592,Processor sharing: A survey of the mathematical theory,"During last few decades the Egalitarian Processor Sharing (EPS) has gained a prominent role in applied probability, especially, in queueing theory and its computer applications. While the EPS paradigm emerged in 1967 as an idealization of round-robin (RR) scheduling algorithm in time-sharing computer systems, it has recently capture renewed interest as a powerful concept for modeling WEB servers. This paper summarizes the most important results concerning the exact solutions for the M/GI/1 queue with egalitarian processor sharing. The material is drawn, mainly, from recent authors’ papers which are supplemented, in small degree, by other related results. Many of the further results are established under the direct influence of our earlier papers. Our main purpose is to give a survey of state-of-the-art with regard to main achievements of the contemporary theory of the M/GI/1 queueing system with processor sharing. The focus is on the methods and techniques of exact and asymptotic analysis of this queueing system. In contrast to the standard surveys, the abridged proofs (or their ideas) of some key theorems and corollaries are included in the paper. We outline recent developments in exact analysis of the M/GI/1-EPS queue with further emphasis on time-dependent (transient) probability distributions of the main characteristics. In particular, the present paper includes the results on the joint time-dependent distribution of the sojourn time of a job arriving at time t with the service demand (length) u, and of the number of jobs at time t- in the M/GI/1 queue with egalitarian processor sharing, which obtained in form of multiple transforms. We also show how the non-stationary solutions can be used to obtain known and new results which allow to predict the behaviour of the EPS queue and to yield additional insights into its new unexpected properties. We also discuss a number of limit theorems arising under the study of the processor sharing queues.",S. F. Yashkov1 & A. S.

In recent decades, nonlinear methods rooted in state space reconstruction have been developed, and they do not assume any model equations but can recover the dynamics purely from the measured time series data. In this review, the development of state space reconstruction techniques will be introduced and the recent advances in systems prediction and causality inference using state space reconstruction will be presented.

Concepts of population stability will be examined in relation to each other on the one hand and, on the other hand, in relation to two dichotomies regarding the dynamic processes to which they correspond: Short-term versus long-term processes and processes concerning phenotypic changes versus process concerning genotypic changes.

After connecting the action to a certain complex wave function and in particular for the case of linear potentials, a link is established between the resulting modified Schrödinger equation which describes specific classes of quantum mechanical systems and the Navier–Stokes equation which describes the motion of viscous fluid matters.",Rami Ahmad El-Nabulsi,Qualitative Theory of Dynamical Systems,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12346-017-0257-9,"Non-standard Lagrangians,Singular Lagrangians,Hamilton–Jacobi equation,Classical and quantum dynamics,Modified Schrödinger equation,Navier–Stokes equation"
1604,Analysis of Artifacts in Shell-Based Image Inpainting: Why They Occur and How to Eliminate Them,"In this paper we study a class of fast geometric image inpainting methods based on the idea of filling the inpainting domain in successive shells from its boundary inwards. Image pixels are filled by assigning them a color equal to a weighted average of their already filled neighbors. However, there is flexibility in terms of the order in which pixels are filled, the weights used for averaging, and the neighborhood that is averaged over. Varying these degrees of freedom leads to different algorithms, and indeed the literature contains several methods falling into this general class. All of them are very fast, but at the same time all of them leave undesirable artifacts such as “kinking” (bending) or blurring of extrapolated isophotes. Our objective in this paper is to build a theoretical model in order to understand why these artifacts occur and what, if anything, can be done about them. Our model is based on two distinct limits: a continuum limit in which the pixel width \(h \rightarrow 0\) and an asymptotic limit in which \(h > 0\) but \(h \ll 1\). The former will allow us to explain “kinking” artifacts (and what to do about them) while the latter will allow us to understand blur. Both limits are derived based on a connection between the class of algorithms under consideration and stopped random walks. At the same time, we consider a semi-implicit extension in which pixels in a given shell are solved for simultaneously by solving a linear system. We prove (within the continuum limit) that this extension is able to completely eliminate kinking artifacts, which we also prove must always be present in the direct method. Finally, we show that although our results are derived in the context of inpainting, they are in fact abstract results that apply more generally. As an example, we show how our theory can also be applied to a problem in numerical linear algebra.

1605,CR Runge Sets on Hypersurface Graphs,"This work contains an improvement of earlier results of Boggess and Dwilewicz regarding global approximation of CR functions by entire functions in the case of hypersurface graphs. In this work, we show that if ω, an open subset of a real hypersurface in ℂn, can be graphed over a convex subset in ℝ2n−1, then ω is CR-Runge in the sense that continuous CR functions on ω can be approximated by entire functions on ℂn in the compact open topology of ω. Examples are presented to show that this approximation result does not hold for graphed CR submanifolds in higher codimension.","Al Boggess1, Roman Dwilewicz2,3 & Dan Jupiter",Journal of Geometric Analysis,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12220-008-9045-8,"CR functions,CR Runge sets,Holomorphic approximation"

It is shown that the analytic center is described by closely related matrix equations, and their properties are analyzed for continuous- and discrete-time systems. Numerical methods are derived to solve these equations via steepest descent and Newton methods. It is also shown that the analytic center has nice robustness properties when it is used to represent passive systems. The results are illustrated by numerical examples.","Daniel Bankmann

First, we introduce a weak entropy formulation for the homogeneous Dirichlet problem associated with the first-order reaction-convection equation that we consider. Then, we establish an existence and uniqueness property for the weak entropy solution. The method of doubling variables and a pointwise reasoning along the curve of discontinuity are used to state uniqueness. Finally, the vanishing viscosity method allows us to prove the existence result. Another method to obtain the existence of a solution, which relies on the regularization of the flux, is also detailled, at least for a particular case.",Julien Jimenez,Journal of Evolution Equations,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00028-011-0101-7,"35L04,35L65,35R05"

We get the stability theorems for the disease-free equilibrium and provide adequate situations of the COVID-19 transmission dynamics equilibrium of present and absent cases. A Hopf bifurcation parameter τ concerns the effects of time delay and we demonstrate that the locally asymptotic stability holds for the present equilibrium. The reproduction number is brief in less than or greater than one, and it effectively is controlling the COVID-19 infection outbreak and subsequently reveals insight into understanding the patterns of the flare-up. We have included eight parameters and the least square method allows us to estimate the initial values for the Indian COVID-19 pandemic from real-life data. It is one of India’s current pandemic models that have been studied for the time being. This Covid19 SEIR model can apply with or without delay to all country’s current pandemic region, after estimating parameter values from their data. The sensitivity of seven parameters has also been explored. The paper also examines the impact of immune response time delay and the importance of determining essential parameters such as the transmission rate using sensitivity indices analysis.

In this paper, we obtain fundamental relations between such defined phase derivative and the Fourier frequency. The results generalize the latest results of quadrature phase derivative in one-dimensional to multi-dimensional cases in the Clifford algebra setting.

This implies that every measure of the numerical scheme is close to a modified invariant measure obtained by asymptotic expansion.

1612,Data Analysis from Empirical Moments and the Christoffel Function,"Spectral features of the empirical moment matrix constitute a resourceful tool for unveiling properties of a cloud of points, among which, density, support and latent structures. This matrix is readily computed from an input dataset, and its eigen decomposition can then be used to identify algebraic properties of the support or density/support estimates with the Christoffel function. It is already well known that the empirical moment matrix encodes a great deal of subtle attributes of the underlying measure. Starting from this object as base of observations, we combine ideas from statistics, real algebraic geometry, orthogonal polynomials and approximation theory for opening new insights relevant for machine learning problems with data supported on algebraic sets. Refined concepts and results from real algebraic geometry and approximation theory are empowering a simple tool (the empirical moment matrix) for the task of solving non-trivial questions in data analysis. We provide (1) theoretical support, (2) numerical experiments and (3) connections to real-world data as a validation of the stamina of the empirical moment matrix approach.","Edouard Pauwels1,2, Mihai Putinar3,4 & Jean-Bernard Lasserre",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-020-09451-2,"Christoffel–Darboux kernel,Empirical measure,Support inference,Manifold,Density estimation,Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces"

The importance of differentiating between the ideal resolution of the operator/matrix to be inverted and the actual or effective resolution obtained by the approximate inverse during an iterative procedure is stressed. Means of obtaining the effective resolution operator for standard iterative procedures such as conjugate gradients, Lanczos, and LSQR are provided, while circumventing the usual need to produce a singular-value decomposition of the operator being inverted. The methods discussed produce very simple results in calculations with infinite precision, but require reorthogonalization of the Krylov vectors/operators produced by the iterative procedures in finite precision. Although this need for reorthogonalization increases the expense of the procedure somewhat, it still produces the desired results much more efficiently than what could be obtained using a full singular-value decomposition of the operator.",James G.

We study the model system using qualitative analysis, bifurcation theory and singular optimal control. We show that the interior equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable and the system under goes a Hopf bifurcation with respect to the ratio of intrinsic growth of the predator and prey population as bifurcation parameter. The existence of bionomic equilibria is analyzed and the singular optimal control strategy is characterized using Pontryagin’s maximum principle. The existence of limit cycles appearing through local Hopf bifurcation and its stability is also examined and validated numerically by computing the first Lyapunov number.

1637,"Polynomial Hierarchy, Betti Numbers, and a Real Analogue of Toda’s Theorem","Toda (in SIAM J. Comput. 20(5):865–877, 1991) proved in 1989 that the (discrete) polynomial time hierarchy, PH, is contained in the class P
#P, namely the class of languages that can be decided by a Turing machine in polynomial time given access to an oracle with the power to compute a function in the counting complexity class #P. This result, which illustrates the power of counting, is considered to be a seminal result in computational complexity theory. An analogous result in the complexity theory over the reals (in the sense of Blum–Shub–Smale real machines in Bull. Am. Math. Soc. (NS) 21(1): 1–46, 1989) has been missing so far. In this paper we formulate and prove a real analogue of Toda’s theorem. Unlike Toda’s proof in the discrete case, which relied on sophisticated combinatorial arguments, our proof is topological in nature. As a consequence of our techniques, we are also able to relate the computational hardness of two extremely well-studied problems in algorithmic semi-algebraic geometry: the problem of deciding sentences in the first-order theory of the reals with a constant number of quantifier alternations, and that of computing Betti numbers of semi-algebraic sets. We obtain a polynomial time reduction of the compact version of the first problem to the second. This latter result may be of independent interest to researchers in algorithmic semi-algebraic geometry.",Saugata Basu1 & Thierry Zell,Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-010-9062-4,"Polynomial hierarchy,Betti numbers,Semi-algebraic sets,Toda’s theorem"

1642,On the real time modeling of interlocking system of passenger lines of Rawalpindi Cantt train station,"PurposeRecent advancements in technology have enabled railway organizations to shift from manual to computer based automated interlocking systems for increasing their efficiency and profits. Since automated systems are complex and interlocking systems are safety critical systems, these systems should be modeled and verified against safety requirements to weed out any design bugs which might lead to catastrophes during their system life cycles. In this study, we model software based automated interlocking control system of a train station, located at Rawalpindi Cantt (Pakistan).MethodsWe have modeled software based automated interlocking control system using timed automata and verified its correctness using UPPAAL model checking software. Timed automata have successfully been used for the modeling and verification of real-time systems.ResultsWe constructed a real-time model of railyard interlocking system by employing a model-checking approach to determine behavior of the model under various conditions. The model checker ascertains the absence of errors in a system by inspecting all the possible states or scenarios of the modeled system. The results show that important properties related to the safety of the designed interlocking system of the railyard management system can be verified using our presented approach. These properties ranged from collision and de-railment avoidance to checking the correct error handling functionality of the timed automata models.ConclusionsThe final modular design can easily adapt to the route upgrades and changes within the station by simple variable adjustments. Based on the laid down methodology and verification techniques, this study can be further built upon, extended and linked to cover the shunting aspect of the train station operations, run through operations, introducing automatic train stop (ATS) functionality and recommend three to four aspect traffic signaling for the train station. This study takes a first step in providing an indigenous solution to an indigenous problem of designing an upgraded and verified signaling infrastructure for Pakistan Railway’s Rawalpindi Cantt train station.","Umar Khan1, Jamil Ahmad1, Tariq Saeed1 & …Sikandar Hayat Mirza",Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40294-016-0028-5,"Railway,Interlocking,CTL,UPPAAL,Real Time,Verification,Timed automata"

Over the complex field, these problems can be solved by Schubert calculus. In the real case the number of solutions can be different on the distinct connected components of the configuration space, resulting in a solution function. The cohomology calculation in the real case only gives the signed sum of the solutions, therefore in general it only gives a lower bound on the range of the solution function. We calculate the solution function for the 2-parameter family and we show that in the even cases the solution function is constant modulo 4. We show how to determine the sign of a solution and describe the connected components of the configuration space. We translate the problem to the language of quivers and also give a geometric interpretation of the sign. Finally, we discuss what aspects might be considered when solving other real enumerative problems.","László M. Fehér1 & Ákos K. Matszangosz

1646,Stability and Resonance Analysis of a General Non-Commensurate Elementary Fractional-Order System,"The elementary fractional-order models are the extension of first and second order models which have been widely used in various engineering fields. Some important properties of commensurate or a few particular kinds of non-commensurate elementary fractional-order transfer functions have already been discussed in the existing studies. However, most of them are only available for one particular kind elementary fractional-order system. In this paper, the stability and resonance analysis of a general kind non-commensurate elementary fractional-order system is presented. The commensurate-order restriction is fully released. Firstly, based on Nyquist’s Theorem, the stability conditions are explored in details under different conditions, namely different combinations of pseudo-damping (ζ) factor values and order parameters. Then, resonance conditions are established in terms of frequency behaviors. At last, an example is given to show the stable and resonant regions of the studied systems.","Shuo Zhang1, Lu Liu2, Dingyu Xue3 & …YangQuan Chen",Fractional Calculus and Applied Analysis,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1515/fca-2020-0007,"Primary 26A33,Secondary 34A08, 93C05, 93D20, 70J40"

It involves a careful handling of the critical modes in the Fourier-transformed problem and an estimate of Gronwall's type. As an example, we treat the Kuramoto-Shivashinsky equation.

It is known that on serial machines these costs can be reduced if the stability function of ans-stage method has only ans-fold real pole. Here these so-called singly-implicit Runge-Kutta methods (SIRKs) are constructed utilizing a recent result on eigenvalue assignment by state feedback and a new tridiagonalization, which preserves the entries required by theW-transformation. These two algorithms in conjunction with an unconstrained minimization allow the numerical treatment of a difficult inverse eigenvalue problem. In particular we compute an 8-stage SIRK which is of order 8 andB-stable. This solves a problem posed by Hairer and Wanner a decade ago. Furthermore, we finds-stageB-stable SIRKs (s=6,8) of orders, which are evenL-stable.",Michael Müller,BIT Numerical Mathematics,1992,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01994850,"Mathematics Subject Classification,65F15,65F30,65L20"

In the same spirit, we prove that for a given integer \(t \ge 1\) with \(t \equiv 0 \pmod {4}\), a positive proportion of fundamental discriminants \(D > 0\) exist for which the class numbers of both the real quadratic fields \(\mathbb {Q}(\sqrt{D})\) and \(\mathbb {Q}(\sqrt{D + t})\) are indivisible by 3. This also addresses the complement of a weak form of a conjecture of Iizuka (J. Numb. Theory, 184:122–127, 2018).

1667,On the norm-preservation of squares in real algebra representation,"One of the main results of the article Gelfand theory for real Banach algebras, recently published in [Rev R Acad Cienc Exactas Fís Nat Ser A Mat RACSAM 114(4):163, 2020] is Proposition 4.1, which establishes that the norm inequality \(\Vert a^{2}\Vert \le \Vert a^{2}+b^{2}\Vert \) for \(a,b\in {\mathcal {A}}\) is sufficient for a commutative real Banach algebra \({\mathcal {A}}\) with a unit to be isomorphic to the space \({\mathcal {C}}_{{\mathbb {R}}}({\mathcal {K}})\) of continuous real-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff space \({\mathcal {K}}\). Moreover, in this proposition is also shown that if the above condition (which involves all the operations of the algebra) holds, then the real-algebra isomorphism given by the Gelfand transform preserves the norm of squares. A very natural question springing from the above-mentioned result is whether an isomorphism of \({\mathcal {A}}\) onto \({\mathcal {C}}_{{\mathbb {R}}}({\mathcal {K}})\) is always norm-preserving of squares. This note is devoted to providing a negative answer to this problem. To that end, we construct algebra norms on spaces \({\mathcal {C}}_{{\mathbb {R}}}({\mathcal {K}})\) which are \((1+\epsilon )\)-equivalent to the sup-norm and with the norm of the identity function equal to 1, where the norm of every nonconstant function is different from the standard sup-norm. We also provide examples of two-dimensional normed real algebras \({\mathcal {A}}\) where \(\Vert a^2\Vert \le k \Vert a^2+b^2\Vert \) for all \(a,b\in {\mathcal {A}}\), for some \(k>1\), but the inequality fails for \(k=1\).","F.

In present study, the filter is a polynomial of the real-part of a linear combination of a few resolvents, and the polynomial is restricted to a Chebyshev polynomial to make the design of the filter simple. In order to apply a few resolvents, the same number of systems of linear equations with different shifts are solved. In present study, we assume those systems of linear equations are solved by some direct method using matrix factorizations. Since only a few resolvents are used, the number of required factorizations is also a few (2–4).",Hiroshi Murakami,Japan Journal of Industrial and Applied Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13160-019-00355-5,"Filter,Eigenproblem,Resolvent,Polynomial"

A left conjugate direction (LCD) method for solving nonsymmetric systems of linear equations is proposed. The method has no breakdown for real positive definite systems. The method reduces to the usual conjugate gradient method when A is symmetric positive definite. A finite termination property of the semi-conjugate direction method is shown, providing a new simple proof of the finite termination property of conjugate gradient methods. The new method is well defined for all nonsingular M-matrices. Some techniques for overcoming breakdown are suggested for general nonsymmetric A. The connection between the semi-conjugate direction method and LU decomposition is established. The semi-conjugate direction method is successfully applied to solve some sample linear systems arising from linear partial differential equations, with attractive convergence rates.

They claimed that it was faster than the LU decomposition implemented in the quaternion Toolbox for Matlab (QTFM). But in 2015, Sangwine, one of the authors of QTFM, pointed out that the tests carried out by him did not support Wang and Ma’s claim. We studied the structure-preserving algorithm of Wang and Ma, and found that the computations were based on element to element operations. In this paper, we re-propose real structure-preserving methods for the quaternion LU decomposition and partial pivoting quaternion LU decomposition, which make full use of high-level operations, and relation of operations between quaternion matrices and their real representation matrices. These algorithms are more efficient than that in QTFM using quaternion arithmetics.

These processes are noise-free. We immerse such a dynamical system into \(\mathbb{R}^{k}\) in a slightly distorted way, which allows us to apply the multidimensional techniques introduced by Saussol (Isr. J. Math. 116:223–248, 2000) for deterministic transformations. The hypotheses we need are, most of them, purely analytic and consist in estimates satisfied by the function \(\varphi \) and by products of its first-order partial derivatives. They ensure that the induced transformation \(T\) is dilating. Under these conditions, \(T\) admits a greatest absolutely continuous invariant measure (ACIM). This implies the existence of an invariant density for \(X_{n}\), satisfying integral compatibility conditions. Moreover, if \(T\) is mixing, one obtains the exponential decay of correlations.","Lisette Jager

 Nontrivial phenomena occur which might be typical

from the theory of lattice ordered groups (in particular the
Conrad-Harvey-Holland Theorem) to get representations by real valued

1702,Rapid analysis of trace pollutants using laser mass spectrometry,"Organic pollution has been gaining more and more attention. Yet, at present the determination of virtually all of them, including polycyclic aromatic carbons (PAHs), the largest single class of chemical carcinogens known today, is made via pre-purification and pre-concentration, The major problems are complexity and time-consuming, thus, no ideal real-time on-line monitoring can be done. Laser mass spectrometry combines UV spectroscopy and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) through resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI). It is characteristic of high sensitivity, high selectivity and rapidity. In this paper, after its principles, a small mobile laser mass spectrometer, in which a mini-excimer (KrF, 248 nm) laser was used, is introduced. Real-time analysis of vehicle exhaust gas was made using this instrument, and the results showed some advantages over traditional methods: multicomponent detection, including benzene, toluene, xylene, C3-benzene, naphthalene, and methyl-naphthalene; high sensitivity (100 ppb); high time-resolution (0.1 s); and no need for prepurification or pre-concentration of samples.","Jie Wei1, Bing Zhang1, Haiyang Zheng1, Liandi Zhang1, Xianghe Kong1, Zhuhong Xia1 & …Xuejun Gu",Science in China Series A: Mathematics,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02880144,"Laser mass spectrometry,Pollutant detection,Aromatic hydrocarbons,REMPI,TOF-MS"

In particular, we show that real spline functions of order m with non-uniform knots containing N terms can be uniquely reconstructed by only m+N Fourier samples. Further, linear combinations of N non-equispaced shifts of a known low-pass function Φ can be reconstructed by N+1 Fourier samples. In the bivariate case, we consider the problem of function recovering by a small amount of Fourier samples on different lines through the origin. Our methods are based on the Prony method.

1704,Common best proximity point theorems: Global minimization of some real-valued multi-objective functions,"Let us deliberate the question of computing a solution to the problems that can be articulated as the simultaneous equations \({Sx = x}\) and \({Tx = x}\) in the framework of metric spaces. However, when the mappings in context are not necessarily self-mappings, then it may be consequential that the equations do not have a common solution. At this juncture, one contemplates to compute a common approximate solution of such a system with the least possible error. Indeed, for a common approximate solution \({x^*}\) of the equations, the real numbers \({d(x^*, Sx^*)}\) and \({d(x^*,Tx^*)}\) measure the errors due to approximation. Eventually, it is imperative that one pulls off the global minimization of the multiobjective functions \({x \rightarrow d(x, Sx)}\) and \({x \rightarrow d(x, Tx)}\). When S and T are mappings from A to B, it follows that \({d(x, Sx) \geq d(A, B)}\) and \({d(x, Tx) \geq d(A, B)}\) for every \({x \in A}\). As a result, the global minimum of the aforesaid problem shall be actualized if it is ascertained that the functions \({x \rightarrow d(x, Sx)}\) and \({x \rightarrow d(x, Tx)}\) attain the lowest possible value d(A, B). The target of this paper is to resolve the preceding multiobjective global minimization problem when S is a T-cyclic contraction or a generalized cyclic contraction, thereby enabling one to determine a common optimal approximate solution to the aforesaid simultaneous equations.",S.

Methods for constructing hyperplanes and selecting a supporting hyperplane are described. Methods are proposed for approximately finding the normalized vector of initial conditions of the adjoint system, the driving time, and the switching times of the time-optimal control, and an iterative method for their refinement is developed.

According to the method, the problem is reduced to the optimal control problem for a large dynamical ordinary differential system, which is solved by applying a dynamical version of the dual linear programming method. The fundamental matrix of the homogeneous part of the system is quasi-decomposed to save computation time at the iterations of the method.

Given a set of timetabled train trips, each with a required number of passenger seats, and a set of train units, each with a given number of available seats, the problem calls for an assignment of the train units to the trips, possibly combining more than one train unit for a given trip, that fulfills the seat requests. With respect to analogous case studies previously faced in the literature, ours is characterized by the fairly large number of distinct train-unit types available (in addition to the fairly large number of trips to be covered). As a result, although there is a wide margin of improvement over the solution used by the practitioners (as our results show), even only finding a solution of the same value is challenging in practice. We present a successful heuristic approach, based on an ILP formulation in which the seat requirement constraints are stated in a “strong” form, derived from the description of the convex hull of the variant of the knapsack polytope arising when the sum of the variables is restricted not to exceed two.

1741,Approximation by Entire Functions on a Countable Union of Real-Axis Segments. 4. Inverse Theorem,"For more than a century, the constructive description of functional classes in terms of the possible rate of approximation of its functions by means of functions chosen from a certain set remains among the most important problems of approximation theory. It turns out that the nonuniformity of the approximation rate due between the points of the domain of the approximated function is substantial. For instance, it was only in the mid-1950s that it was possible to constructively describe Holder classes on the segment [–1; 1] in terms of the approximation by algebraic polynomials. For that particular case, the constructive description requires the approximation at neighborhoods of the segment endpoints to be essentially better than the one in a neighborhood of its midpoint. A possible approximation quality test is to find out whether the approximation rate provides a possibility to reconstruct the smoothness of the approximated function. Earlier, we investigated the approximation of classes of smooth functions on a countable union of segments on the real axis. In the present paper, we prove that the rate of the approximation by the entire exponential-type functions provides the possibility to reconstruct the smoothness of the approximated function, i.e., a constructive description of classes of smooth functions is possible in terms of the specified approximation method. In an earlier paper, that result is announced for Holder classes, but the construction of a certain function needed for the proof is omitted. In the present paper, we use another proof; it does not apply the specified function.",O. V. Sil’vanovich1 & N. A.

1747,Integration of polynomial ordinary differential equations in the real plane,"
Which differential equations can be integrated using functions that appear in the Differential Calculus? This is an ancient problem that has been considered by I. Newton, H. Poincaré, H. Dulac and P. Painlevé ([7],[8]). We address this question for differential equations of the form (1) \( {dy_1\over dx_1} = {P_1(x_1,y_1)\over Q_1(x_1,y_1)} \) where \( P_1,Q_1\in {\Bbb R}[x_1,y_1] \) are polynomials in two real variables.  The  classification of such an integrable equation is strongly related to the study of its complexification, mainly its complex singularities. For instance, we prove that if the complexification has only generic singularities  then a polynomial differential equation (1) as above, which is integrable in the sense of Liouville (see §2 for the definition), must come from a linear differential equation after introduction of complex coefficients. Relaxing slightly the hypothesis on the singularities we obtain also Bernoulli differential equations (see §3 for these main results). These conclusions enforce original ideas of P. Painlevé (see Remark 3 in §3). Based on this classification, an interesting application to certain polynomial vector fields whose orbits have an algebraic curve as limit set in \( {\Bbb R}^2 \) is given in §4. It is  proved that under appropriate  hypothesis these equations also come from linear or Bernoulli equations.

As far as we know, there do not exist in the literature specific algorithms aiming to solve these problems. For the case in which all entries of A can be modified, there exists an algorithm by Ruhe, which is able to compute the closest normal matrix. However, if A is real, the closest computed matrix by Ruhe’s algorithm might be complex, which motivates the development of a different algorithm preserving reality. Normality is characterized in a very large number of ways; in this article, we consider the property that the square of the Frobenius norm of a normal matrix is equal to the sum of the squares of the moduli of its eigenvalues. This characterization allows us to formulate as equivalent problem the minimization of a functional of an unknown matrix, which should be normal, fulfill the required constraints, and have minimal distance from the given matrix A.",Nicola Guglielmi1 & Carmela Scalone,Advances in Computational Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-019-09717-6,"Normal completion,Closest real normal matrix,Closest normal matrix,Normal completion of minimal norm,Matrix nearness problems,Matrix ODEs"

1759,Towards state locality in quantum field theory: free fermions,"Hilbert spaces of states can be constructed in standard quantum field theory only for infinitely extended spacelike hypersurfaces, precluding a more local notion of state. In fact, the Reeh–Schlieder theorem prohibits the localization of states on pieces of hypersurfaces in the standard formalism. From the point of view of geometric quantization, the problem lies in the nonlocality of the complex structures associated to hypersurfaces in standard quantization. We show that using a weakened version of the positive formalism puts this problem into a new perspective. This is a local TQFT-type formalism based on super-operators and mixed state spaces rather than on amplitudes and pure state spaces as the one of Atiyah–Segal. In particular, we show that in the case of purely fermionic degrees of freedom the complex structure can be dispensed with when the notion of state is suitably generalized. These generalized states do localize on compact hypersurfaces with boundaries. For the simplest case of free fermionic fields, we embed this in a rigorous and functorial quantization scheme yielding a local description of the quantum theory. Crucially, no classical data is needed beyond the structures evident from a Lagrangian setting. When the classical data is augmented with complex structures on hypersurfaces, the quantum data correspondingly augment to the full positive formalism. This scheme is applicable to field theory in curved spacetime, but also to field theories without metric background.","Robert Oeckl

1765,A systematic approach to parameter optimization and its application to flight schedule simulation software,"Industrial software often has many parameters that critically impact performance. Frequently, these are left in a sub-optimal configuration for a given application because searching over possible configurations is costly and, except for developer instinct, the relationships between parameters and performance are often unclear and complex. While there have been significant advances in automated parameter tuning approaches recently, they are typically black-box. The high-quality solutions produced are returned to the user without explanation. The nature of optimisation means that, often, these solutions are far outside the well-established settings for the software, making it difficult to accept and use them. To address the above issue, a systematic approach to software parameter optimization is presented. Several well-established techniques are followed in sequence, each underpinning the next, with rigorous analysis of the search space. This allows the results to be explainable to both end users and developers, improving confidence in the optimal solutions, particularly where they are counter-intuitive. The process comprises statistical analysis of the parameters; single-objective optimization for each target objective; functional ANOVA to explain trends and inter-parameter interactions; and a multi-objective optimization seeded with the results from the single-objective stage. A case study demonstrates application to business-critical software developed by the international airline Air France-KLM for measuring flight schedule robustness. A configuration is found with a run-time of 80% that of the tried-and-tested configuration, with no loss in predictive accuracy. The configuration is supplemented with detailed analysis explaining the importance of each parameter, how they interact with each other, how they influence run-time and accuracy, and how the final configuration was reached. In particular, this explains why the configuration included some parameter settings that were outwith the usually recommended range, greatly increasing developer confidence and encouraging adoption of the new configuration.","Alexander E.

We prove that such a surface is an image of a subset of one of the following sets under some composition of inversions:

the set \(\{p+q:p\in \alpha ,q\in \beta \}\), where \(\alpha ,\beta \) are two circles in \(\mathbb {R}^3\);


the set \(\{2\frac{p \times q^{}}{|p+q|^2}:p\in \alpha ,q\in \beta ,p+q\ne 0\}\), where \(\alpha ,\beta \) are circles in the unit sphere \({S}^2\);


the set \(\{(x,y,z): Q(x,y,z,x^2+y^2+z^2)=0\}\), where \(Q\in \mathbb {R}[x,y,z,t]\) has degree 2 or 1.

1774,Point-like bounding chains in open Gromov–Witten theory,"We present a solution to the problem of defining genus zero open Gromov–Witten invariants with boundary constraints for a Lagrangian submanifold of arbitrary dimension. Previously, such invariants were known only in dimensions 2 and 3 from the work of Welschinger. Our approach does not require the Lagrangian to be fixed by an anti-symplectic involution, but can use such an involution, if present, to obtain stronger results. Also, non-trivial invariants are defined for broader classes of interior constraints and Lagrangian submanifolds than previously possible even in the presence of an anti-symplectic involution. The invariants of the present work specialize to invariants of Welschinger, Fukaya, and Georgieva in many instances. The main obstacle to defining open Gromov–Witten invariants with boundary constraints in arbitrary dimension is the bubbling of J-holomorphic disks. Unlike in low dimensions or for interior constraints, disk bubbles do not cancel in pairs by anti-symplectic involution symmetry. Rather, we use the technique of bounding chains introduced in Fukaya–Oh–Ohta–Ono’s work on Lagrangian Floer theory to cancel disk bubbling. At the same time and independently, gauge equivalence classes of bounding chains play the role of boundary constraints, in place of the cohomology classes that usually serve as constraints in Gromov–Witten theory. A crucial step in our construction is to identify a canonical up to gauge equivalence family of “point-like” bounding chains, which specialize in dimensions 2 and 3 to the point constraints considered by Welschinger.",Jake P.

The main goal is to estimate nonparametrically some characteristics of this conditional distribution. Kernel type estimators for the conditional cumulative distribution function and the successive derivatives of the conditional density are introduced. Asymptotic properties are stated for each of these estimates, and they are applied to the estimations of the conditional mode and conditional quantiles.Our asymptotic results highlightes the importance of the concentration properties on small balls of the probability measure of the underlying functional variable. So, a special section is devoted to show how our results behave in several situations when the functional variable is a continuous time process, with special attention to diffusion processes and Gaussian processes.Even if the main purpose of our paper is theoretical, an application to some chemiometrical data set coming from food industry is presented in a short final section.

Convergence of formal mappings for real-analytic generic submanifolds under appropriate assumptions is proved, and natural geometric conditions are given to assure that if two germs of such submanifolds are formally equivalent, then, they are necessarily biholomorphically equivalent. It is also shown that if two real-algebraic hypersurfaces in ℂN are biholomorphically equivalent, then, they are algebraically equivalent. All the results are first proved in the more general context of “reflection ideals” associated to formal mappings between formal as well as real-analytic and real-algebraic manifolds.","M. S.

1782,Essentially optimal explicit Runge–Kutta methods with application to hyperbolic–parabolic equations,"Optimal explicit Runge–Kutta methods consider more stages in order to include a particular spectrum in their stability domain and thus reduce time-step restrictions. This idea, so far used mostly for real-line spectra, is generalized to more general spectra in the form of a thin region. In thin regions the eigenvalues may extend away from the real axis into the imaginary plane. We give a direct characterization of optimal stability polynomials containing a maximal thin region and calculate these polynomials for various cases. Semi-discretizations of hyperbolic–parabolic equations are a relevant application which exhibit a thin region spectrum. As a model, linear, scalar advection–diffusion is investigated. The second-order-stabilized explicit Runge–Kutta methods derived from the stability polynomials are applied to advection–diffusion and compressible, viscous fluid dynamics in numerical experiments.

With many developments in internet technology, particularly in relation to interactivity and communication, the textbook problem is gaining in importance since data and expert judgements can be made available over the web to be used by many different individuals to shape their own beliefs in many different contexts. Moreover, applications such as web-based decision support, e-participation and e-democracy are making algorithmic ‘solutions’ to the group decision problem attractive, despite many results showing we know that such solutions are, at best, rare and, at worst, illusory. In this paper I survey developments since my earlier paper and note some unresolved issues. Then I turn to how expert judgement might be used within web-based group decision support, as well as in e-participation and e-democracy contexts. The latter points to a growing importance of the textbook problem and suggests that Cooke’s principles for scientific reporting of expert judgement studies may need enhancing for such studies to be used by a wider audience.",Simon French,"Revista de la Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas, Fisicas y Naturales.

1793," The \({\cal {D Q R}}\) algorithm, basic theory, convergence, and conditional stability"," We describe a fast matrix eigenvalue algorithm that uses a matrix factorization and reverse order multiply technique involving three factors  and that is based on the symmetric matrix factorization as well as on \(D\)–orthogonal reduction techniques where \(D= \mbox{ diag}(\pm1)\) is computed from the given matrix \(A\). It operates on a similarity reduction of a real matrix \(A_{nn}\) to general tridiagonal form \(T\) and computes all of \(A\)'s eigenvalues in \(\frac{4}{3} n^3 + O(n^2)\) operations, where the \(O(n^2)\) part of the operations is possibly performed over \({\Bbb C}\), instead of the 7–8 \(n^3\) real flops required by the \(QR\) eigenvalue algorithm. Potential breakdo wn of the \(DQR\) algorithm can occur in the reduction to tridiagonal form and in the \(D\)–orthogonal \(DQR\) reductions. Both, however, can be monitored during the computations. The former  occurs rather rarely for dimensions \(n \leq 300\) and can essentially be bypassed, while the latter is extremely rare and can be bypassed as well in our conditionally stable implementation of the \(DQR\) steps. We prove an implicit \(DQ\) theorem which allows implicit shifts, give a convergence proof for the \(DQR\) algorithm and show that \(DQR\) is conditionally stable for general balanced tridiagonal matrices \(T_{\rm b}\).

Part one,"In October 1924, The Physical Review, a relatively minor journal at the time, published a remarkable two-part paper by John H. Van Vleck, working in virtual isolation at the University of Minnesota. Using Bohr’s correspondence principle and Einstein’s quantum theory of radiation along with advanced techniques from classical mechanics, Van Vleck showed that quantum formulae for emission, absorption, and dispersion of radiation merge with their classical counterparts in the limit of high quantum numbers. For modern readers Van Vleck’s paper is much easier to follow than the famous paper by Kramers and Heisenberg on dispersion theory, which covers similar terrain and is widely credited to have led directly to Heisenberg’s Umdeutung paper. This makes Van Vleck’s paper extremely valuable for the reconstruction of the genesis of matrix mechanics. It also makes it tempting to ask why Van Vleck did not take the next step and develop matrix mechanics himself.","Anthony Duncan1 & Michel Janssen2,",Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-007-0010-x,"Quantum Theory,Physical Review,Correspondence Principle,Light Quantum,Dispersion Theory"

National accounts also take into account the costs of productive capital and fixed capital stocks, which are valued by their market value. It is shown that when the discounted capital is underestimated as compared to the market value, the money in circulation serves turnover only and does not ensure the reproduction of capital.

Furthermore, we propose a theoretical methodology to study the convergence of MSO algorithms based on three basic assumptions: (a) local Hölder continuity of the objective function f, (b) partitions boundedness, and (c) partitions sphericity. Moreover, the worst-case finite-time performance and convergence rate of several leading MSO algorithms, namely, Lipschitzian optimization methods, multi-level coordinate search, dividing rectangles, and optimistic optimization methods have been presented.","Abdullah Al-Dujaili1, S.

1803,Systematic Analysis of Emergent Collective Motion Produced by a 3D Hybrid Zonal Model,"Emergent patterns of collective motion are thought to arise from local rules of interaction that govern how individuals adjust their velocity in response to the relative locations and velocities of near neighbours. Many models of collective motion apply rules of interaction over a metric scale, based on the distances to neighbouring group members. However, empirical work suggests that some species apply interactions over a topological scale, based on distance determined neighbour rank. Here, we modify an important metric model of collective motion (Couzin et al. in J Theor Biol 218(1):1–11, 2002), so that interactions relating to orienting movements with neighbours and attraction towards more distant neighbours operate over topological scales. We examine the emergent group movement patterns generated by the model as the numbers of neighbours that contribute to orientation- and attraction-based velocity adjustments vary. Like the metric form of the model, simulated groups can fragment (when interactions are influenced by less than 10–15% of the group), swarm and move in parallel, but milling does not occur. The model also generates other cohesive group movements including cases where groups exhibit directed motion without strong overall alignment of individuals. Multiple emergent states are possible for the same set of underlying model parameters in some cases, suggesting sensitivity to initial conditions, and there is evidence that emergent states of the system depend on the history of the system. Groups that do not fragment tend to stay relatively compact in terms of neighbour distances. Even if a group does fragment, individuals remain relatively close to near neighbours, avoiding complete isolation.

The goal of the paper is to give the physical meaning of these mutual relations. Here we take the concept of linear stationary filter and loss of entropy in it as basic. In the first part of the paper the account is given for the case of discrete time, and in the second part we give the method of passing to continuous time. To this end we introduce the concept of stationary sampling system. This is a sequence of functions from L2(ℝ), which transforms any stationary Gaussian process\(\left( {\mathfrak{X}_t } \right)_{t \in \mathbb{R}} \) with continuous correlation function into a stationary Gaussian process with discrete time. Such systems can be described in terms of the Fourier transform. Laguerre systems where z is a fixed point in the upper half-plane, play a special role among all sampling systems. If z=i, then is a classical Laguerre function on the line up to a multiplicative constant. Laguerre sampling systems allow one to give the entropy meaning to the values of the harmonic extension to the upper half-plane of the logarithm of the spectral density of the process",S. V.

1808,Flux Splitting for Stiff Equations: A Notion on Stability,"For low Mach number flows, there is a strong recent interest in the development and analysis of IMEX (implicit/explicit) schemes, which rely on a splitting of the convective flux into stiff and nonstiff parts. A key ingredient of the analysis is the so-called Asymptotic Preserving property, which guarantees uniform consistency and stability as the Mach number goes to zero. While many authors have focused on asymptotic consistency, we study asymptotic stability in this paper: does an IMEX scheme allow for a CFL number which is independent of the Mach number? We derive a stability criterion for a general linear hyperbolic system. In the decisive eigenvalue analysis, the advective term, the upwind diffusion and a quadratic term stemming from the truncation in time all interact in a subtle way. As an application, we show that a new class of splittings based on characteristic decomposition, for which the commutator vanishes, avoids the deterioration of the time step which has sometimes been observed in the literature.",Jochen Schütz1 & Sebastian Noelle,Journal of Scientific Computing,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-014-9942-x,"IMEX finite volume,Asymptotic preserving,Flux splitting, Modified equation,Stability analysis"

1810,Identification and robustness analysis of nonlinear multi-stage enzyme-catalytic dynamical system in batch culture,"In this paper, based on biological phenomena of different characters at different stages, we propose a nonlinear multi-stage enzyme-catalytic dynamic system with unknown time and system parameters. Such system starts at different initial conditions for formulating batch culture process of glycerol bio-dissimilation to 1,3-propanediol. Some properties of the nonlinear system are discussed. In view of the difficulty in accurately measuring the concentration of intracellular substances and the absence of equilibrium points for the nonlinear system, we quantitatively define biological robustness for the entire process of batch culture instead of one for the approximately stable state of continuous culture. Taking the biological robustness of the intracellular substances together with the relative error between the experimental data and the computational values of the extracellular substances as the cost function, we formulate an identification problem subject to the nonlinear system, continuous state inequality constraints and parameter constraints. Analytical solution to system is not naturally available, therefore, a huge number of numerical computations of the proposed system and the proposed biological robustness make solving the identification problem by a serial computer a very complicated task. To improve computational efficiency, we develop an effective parallelized optimization algorithm, based on the constraint transcription and smoothing approximation techniques, for seeking the optimal time and system parameters. Compared with previous work, we assert that the optimal time and system parameters together with the corresponding nonlinear multi-stage dynamical system can reasonably describe batch fermentation at different initial conditions.","Jinlong Yuan1,2,3, Xu Zhang1, Xi Zhu1, Enmin Feng1, Hongchao Yin2, Zhilong Xiu3 & …Bing Tan",Computational and Applied Mathematics,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-014-0160-9,"Nonlinear multi-stage system,Robustness analysis,Constraint transcription,Parallel optimization,Microbial batch fermentation"

1812,Boundary null-controllability of 1-D coupled parabolic systems with Kirchhoff-type conditions,"The main concern of this article is to investigate the boundary controllability of some \(2\times 2\) one-dimensional parabolic systems with both the interior and boundary couplings: The interior coupling is chosen to be linear with constant coefficient while the boundary one is considered by means of some Kirchhoff-type condition at one end of the domain. We consider here the Dirichlet boundary control acting only on one of the two state components at the other end of the domain. In particular, we show that the controllability properties change depending on which component of the system the control is being applied. Regarding this, we point out that the choices of the interior coupling coefficient and the Kirchhoff parameter play a crucial role to deduce the positive or negative controllability results. Further to this, we pursue a numerical study based on the well-known penalized HUM approach. We make some discretization for a general interior-boundary coupled parabolic system, mainly to incorporate the effects of the boundary couplings into the discrete setting. This allows us to illustrate our theoretical results as well as to experiment some more examples which fit under the general framework, for instance a similar system with a Neumann boundary control on either one of the two components.","Kuntal Bhandari1, Franck Boyer

The division rate of the proliferating cells is assumed to be nonlinear due to the limitation of the nutrient and space. The model includes a proportion of newborn cells that enter directly the quiescent phase with age zero. This proportion can reflect the effect of treatment by drugs such as erlotinib.

1817,Characterizing optimality in mathematical programming models,"This paper is a survey of basic results that characterize optimality in single- and multi-objective mathematical programming models. Many people believe, or want to believe, that the underlying behavioural structure of management, economic, and many other systems, generates basically ‘continuous’ processes. This belief motivates our definition and study of optimality, termed ‘structural’ optimality. Roughly speaking, we say that a feasible point of a mathematical programming model is structurally optimal if every improvement of the optimal value function, with respect to parameters, results in discontinuity of the corresponding feasible set of decision variables. This definition appears to be more suitable for many applications and it is also more general than the usual one: every optimum is a structural optimum but not necessarily vice versa. By characterizing structural optima, we obtain some new, and recover the familiar, optimality conditions in nonlinear programming.The paper is self-contained. Our approach is geometric and inductive: we develop intiution by studying finite-dimensional models before moving on to abstract situations.",S.

1818,Stabilizing the Metzler matrices with applications to dynamical systems,"Real matrices with non-negative off-diagonal entries play a crucial role for modelling the positive linear dynamical systems. In the literature, these matrices are referred to as Metzler matrices or negated Z-matrices. Finding the closest stable Metzler matrix to an unstable one (and vice versa) is an important issue with many applications. The stability considered here is in the sense of Hurwitz, and the distance between matrices is measured in \(l_\infty ,\,l_1\), and in the max norm. We provide either explicit solutions or efficient algorithms for obtaining the closest (un)stable matrix. The procedure for finding the closest stable Metzler matrix is based on the recently introduced selective greedy spectral method for optimizing the Perron eigenvalue. Originally intended for non-negative matrices, here is generalized to Metzler matrices. The efficiency of the new algorithms is demonstrated in examples and numerical experiments for the dimension of up to 2000. Applications to dynamical systems, linear switching systems, and sign-matrices are considered.","Aleksandar Cvetković

1820,The Szegö Metric Associated to Hardy Spaces of Clifford Algebra Valued Functions and Some Geometric Properties,"In analogy to complex function theory we introduce a Szegö metric in the context of hypercomplex function theory dealing with functions that take values in a Clifford algebra. In particular, we are dealing with Clifford algebra valued functions that are annihilated by the Euclidean Dirac operator in \({\mathbb{R}^{m+1}}\) . These are often called monogenic functions. As a consequence of the isometry between two Hardy spaces of monogenic functions on domains that are related to each other by a conformal map, the generalized Szegö metric turns out to have a pseudo-invariance under Möbius transformations. This property is crucially applied to show that the curvature of this metric is always negative on bounded domains. Furthermore, it allows us to establish that this metric is complete on bounded domains.",Dennis Grob1 & Rolf Sören Kraußhar,Complex Analysis and Operator Theory,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11785-011-0206-6,"Bounded Domain,Dirac Operator,Hardy Space,Bergman Space,Clifford Algebra"

We assume that the arrival rates do not deteriorate visibly within a very short period. Our approach consists of two stages. In the first stage, we employ a typical genetic algorithm to select N=1024 roughly good solutions from the huge discrete solution space Ω using an offline trained artificial neural network as a surrogate model for fitness evaluation. The second stage consists of several substages to select estimated good enough solutions from the previous N, and the solution obtained in the last substage is the good enough solution that we seek. Using numerous tests, we demonstrate: (i) the computational efficiency of our algorithm in the aspect that we can apply our algorithm in real-time based on the arrival rate assumption; (ii) the superiority of the good enough solution, which achieves drastic objective value reduction in comparison with other existing service disciplines. We provide a performance analysis for our algorithm based on the derived models. The results show that the good enough solution that we obtained is among the best 3.31×10−6% in the solution space with probability 0.99.",S.-C. Horng1 & S.-Y.

1822,Positive-instantaneous frequency and approximation,"Positive-instantaneous frequency representation for transient signals has always been a great concern due to its theoretical and practical importance, although the involved concept itself is paradoxical. The desire and practice of uniqueness of such frequency representation (decomposition) raise the related topics in approximation. During approximately the last two decades there has formulated a signal decomposition and reconstruction method rooted in harmonic and complex analysis giving rise to the desired signal representations. The method decomposes any signal into a few basic signals that possess positive instantaneous frequencies. The theory has profound relations to classical mathematics and can be generalized to signals defined in higher dimensional manifolds with vector and matrix values, and in particular, promotes kernel approximation for multi-variate functions. This article mainly serves as a survey. It also gives two important technical proofs of which one for a general convergence result (Theorem 3.4), and the other for necessity of multiple kernel (Lemma 3.7).Expositorily, for a given real-valued signal f one can associate it with a Hardy space function F whose real part coincides with f. Such function F has the form F = f + iH f, where H stands for the Hilbert transformation of the context. We develop fast converging expansions of F in orthogonal terms of the form
$$F = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^\infty {{c_k}{B_k},} $$where Bk’s are also Hardy space functions but with the additional properties
$${B_k}(t) = {\rho _k}(t){e^{i{\theta _k}(t)}},\,\,\,\,\,\,{\rho _k} \geqslant 0,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\theta _k^\prime (t) \geqslant 0,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\rm{a}}.{\rm{e}}.$$The original real-valued function f is accordingly expanded
$$f = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^\infty {{\rho _k}(t)\cos {\theta _k}(t)} $$which, besides the properties of ρk and θk given above, also satisfies
$$H({\rho _k}\cos {\theta _k})(t) = {\rho _k}(t)\sin {\theta _k}(t).$$Real-valued functions f (t)= ρ(t)cos θ(t) that satisfy the condition
$$\rho \geqslant 0,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\theta ^\prime }(t) \geqslant 0,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,H(\rho \cos \theta )(t) = \rho (t)\sin \theta (t)$$are called mono-components. If f is a mono-component, then the phase derivative θ′(t) is defined to be instantaneous frequency of f. The above described positive-instantaneous frequency expansion is a generalization of the Fourier series expansion. Mono-components are crucial to understand the concept instantaneous frequency. We will present several most important mono-component function classes. Decompositions of signals into mono-components are called adaptive Fourier decompositions (AFDs). We note that some scopes of the studies on the 1D mono-components and AFDs can be extended to vector-valued or even matrix-valued signals defined on higher dimensional manifolds. We finally provide an account of related studies in pure and applied mathematics.",Tao Qian,Frontiers of Mathematics in China,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11464-022-1014-1,"Möbius transform,blaschke product,mono-component,hilbert transform,hardy space,inner and outer functions,adaptive fourier decomposition,rational orthogonal system,nevanlinna factorization,beurling-lax theorem,reproducing kernel hilbert space,several complex variables,clifford algebra,pre-orthogonal AFD"

1824,Topological cones: functional analysis in a T0-setting,"Already in his PhD Thesis on compact Abelian semigroups under the direction of Karl Heinrich Hofmann the author was lead to investigate locally compact cones (Keimel in Math. Z. 99:205–428, 1967). This happened in the setting of Hausdorff topologies. The theme of topological cones has been reappearing in the author’s work in a non-Hausdorff setting motivated by the needs of mathematical models for a denotational semantics of languages combining probabilistic and nondeterministic choice. This is in the line of common work with Karl Heinrich Hofmann in Continuous Lattices and Domains (Gierz et al. in Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications, vol. 93, 2003).Domain Theory is based on order theoretical notions from which intrinsic non-Hausdorff topologies are derived. Along these lines, domain theoretical variants of (sub-) probability measures have been introduced by Jones and Plotkin (Jones, PhD thesis, 1990; Jones and Plotkin in Proceedings of the Fourth Annual Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, pp. 186–195, 1989). Kirch (Master’s thesis, 1993) and Tix (Master’s thesis, 1995) have extended this theory to a domain theoretical version of measures and they have introduced and studied directed complete partially ordered cones as appropriate structures. Driven by the needs of a semantics for languages combining probability and nondeterminism, Tix (Theor. Comput. Sci 264:205–218, 1999; PhD thesis, 1999) and later on Plotkin and Keimel (Electron. Notes Theor. Comput. Sci. 129:1–104, 2005) developed basic functional analytic tools for these structures.In this paper we extend this theory to topological cones the topologies of which are strongly non-Hausdorff. We carefully introduce these structures and their elementary properties. We prove Hahn-Banach type separation theorems under appropriate local convexity hypotheses. We finally construct a monad assigning to every topological cone C another topological cone 
\(\mathcal{S}(C)\) 
the elements of which are nonempty compact convex subsets of C. For proving that this construction has good properties needed for the application in semantics we use the functional analytic tools developed before.",Klaus Keimel,Semigroup Forum,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00233-008-9078-0,"Cones,Topological cones,Hahn-Banach type theorems,Probability and nondeterminism,Powerdomains in semantics"
1825,"Incentives, lockdown, and testing: from Thucydides’ analysis to the COVID-19 pandemic","In this work, we provide a general mathematical formalism to study the optimal control of an epidemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, via incentives to lockdown and testing. In particular, we model the interplay between the government and the population as a principal–agent problem with moral hazard, à la Cvitanić et al. (Finance Stoch 22(1):1–37, 2018), while an epidemic is spreading according to dynamics given by compartmental stochastic SIS or SIR models, as proposed respectively by Gray et al. (SIAM J Appl Math 71(3):876–902, 2011) and Tornatore et al. (Phys A Stat Mech Appl 354(15):111–126, 2005). More precisely, to limit the spread of a virus, the population can decrease the transmission rate of the disease by reducing interactions between individuals. However, this effort—which cannot be perfectly monitored by the government—comes at social and monetary cost for the population. To mitigate this cost, and thus encourage the lockdown of the population, the government can put in place an incentive policy, in the form of a tax or subsidy. In addition, the government may also implement a testing policy in order to know more precisely the spread of the epidemic within the country, and to isolate infected individuals. In terms of technical results, we demonstrate the optimal form of the tax, indexed on the proportion of infected individuals, as well as the optimal effort of the population, namely the transmission rate chosen in response to this tax. The government’s optimisation problems then boils down to solving an Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. Numerical results confirm that if a tax policy is implemented, the population is encouraged to significantly reduce its interactions. If the government also adjusts its testing policy, less effort is required on the population side, individuals can interact almost as usual, and the epidemic is largely contained by the targeted isolation of positively-tested individuals.","Emma Hubert1, Thibaut Mastrolia

1826,Solving the Giant Stars Problem: Theories of Stellar Evolution from The 1930s to The 1950s,"Historiography has pointed out that the time between the mid 1910s and the early 1930s can be considered a pivotal period in the history of stellar astrophysics. In those years, scholars like Saha and Eddington first applied atomic physics to astrophysics. Theoretical astrophysics was born. This led to the development of the first physically sound models for stellar interiors and atmospheres. These landmark achievements spurred scholars to elaborate theories for stellar evolutions, and in the following decades several astrophysicists focused on this problem. The evolutionary role of red giants turned out to be the main issue. Those stars were initially assumed to be young ones going through the formation stage, but astrophysicists gradually realized that they were rather to be considered old, evolved stars. The solution of the giant stars issue required a couple of decades: it was not until the mid 1950s that a satisfactory explanation was obtained. This provides a detailed picture of the theories of stellar evolution from the 1930s to the 1950s and of the solution to the red giants problem, with special emphasis on how such a solution was made possible by a series of subsequent steps: the identification of changing chemical composition as a main evolutionary feature of a star, the inclusion of nuclear physics within the theoretical framework of stellar astrophysics, the recognition of the importance of inhomogeneities that settle within stars as nuclear processes go on.",Davide Cenadelli,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-009-0055-0,"Globular Cluster,Main Sequence,Stellar Evolution,Stellar Model,Monthly Notice"

The analysis of their sequence is a fundamental issue in many areas of chemistry, medicine and biology. Nowadays, the prevalent approach to this problem consists in using a mass spectrometry analysis that gives information about the molecular weights of the polymer and of its fragments. This information should be used in order to obtain the sequence. This is however a difficult mathematical problem, and several approaches have been proposed for it. In particular, a promising one is based on a propositional logic modeling of the problem. This paper presents conceptual improvements in this approach, principally the off-line computation of a database that substantially speeds-up the sequencing operations. This is obtained by finding a correspondence between sequences and natural numbers, so that all sequences up to a certain molecular weight can be implicitly considered in the above database, and explicitly computed only when needed.

proximity predicates in each of the three dimensions. Numerical experiments are carried out both
on real and synthetic data and confirm the superiority of the NOAC method in terms of the
performance criteria for the resulting triclusters.

It leads to the high quality local error bounds in the problem of the direct-solution steady-state dynamic analysis with a frequency-domain finite element, which involves the enrichments with plural variable basis functions. The solution of the steady-state dynamic procedure calculates the harmonic response directly in terms of the physical degrees of freedom in the model, which uses the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices of the system.

This model is reduced to a system of two ordinary differential equations with two constant delays for which we show existence of a unique steady state. We determine all instances at which this steady state loses stability via a Hopf bifurcation through a theoretical bifurcation analysis establishing analytical expressions for the scenarios in which they arise. We show examples of supercritical Hopf bifurcations for parameter values estimated according to physiological values for humans found in the literature and present numerical simulations in agreement with the theoretical analysis.

1857,"Stability of the human respiratory control system
I. Analysis of a two-dimensional delay state-space model"," A number of mathematical models of the human respiratory control system have been developed since 1940 to study a wide range of features of this complex system. Among them, periodic breathing (including Cheyne-Stokes respiration and apneustic breathing) is a collection of regular but involuntary breathing patterns that have important medical implications. The hypothesis that periodic breathing is the result of delay in the feedback signals to the respiratory control system has been studied since the work of Grodins et al. in the early 1950's [12]. The purpose of this paper is to study the stability characteristics of a feedback control system of five differential equations with delays in both the state and control variables presented by Khoo et al. [17] in 1991 for modeling human respiration. The paper is divided in two parts. Part I studies a simplified mathematical model of two nonlinear state equations modeling arterial partial pressures of O2 and CO2 and a peripheral controller. Analysis was done on this model to illuminate the effect of delay on the stability. It shows that delay dependent stability is affected by the controller gain, compartmental volumes and the manner in which changes in the ventilation rate is produced (i.e., by deeper breathing or faster breathing). In addition, numerical simulations were performed to validate analytical results. Part II extends the model in Part I to include both peripheral and central controllers. This, however, necessitates the introduction of a third state equation modeling CO2 levels in the brain. In addition to analytical studies on delay dependent stability, it shows that the decreased cardiac output (and hence increased delay) resulting from the congestive heart condition can induce instability at certain control gain levels. These analytical results were also confirmed by numerical simulations.",J.J. Batzel1 & H.T.

1862,Variational Analysis of the Abscissa Mapping for Polynomials via the Gauss-Lucas Theorem,"Consider the linear space ℘n of polynomials of degree n or less over the complex field. The abscissa mapping on ℘n is the mapping that takes a polynomial to the maximum real part of its roots. This mapping plays a key role in the study of stability properties for linear systems. Burke and Overton have shown that the abscissa mapping is everywhere subdifferentially regular in the sense of Clarke on the manifold ℳn of polynomials of degree n. In addition, they provide a formula for the subdifferential. The result is surprising since the abscissa mapping is not Lipschitzian on ℳn. A key supporting lemma uses a proof technique due to Levantovskii for determining the tangent cone to the set of stable polynomials. This proof is arduous and opaque. It is a major obstacle to extending the variational theory to other functions of the roots of polynomials. In this note, we provide an alternative proof based on the Gauss-Lucas Theorem. This new proof is both insightful and elementary.","James V. Burke1, Adrian S. Lewis2 & Michael L.

The model consists of a discretetimed Petri net and a continuous Petri net which interact eachother through condition and event signals. By introducing timeddiscrete places in the model, timing constraints in hybrid systemscan be easily described. For a class of hybrid systems that canbe described as linear hybrid net condition /eventsystems whose continuous part is a constant continuous Petrinet, two methods are developed for their state reachability analysis.One is the predicate-transformation method, which is an extensionof a state reachability analysis method for linear hybrid automata.The other is the path-based method, which enumerates all possiblefiring seqenences of discrete transitions and verifies if a givenset of states can be reached from another set by firing a sequenceof discrete transitions. The verification is performed by solvinga constraint satisfaction problem. A technique that adds additionalconstraints to the problem when a discrete state is revisitedalong the sequence is developed and used to prevent the methodfrom infinite enumeration.

The model is a modified version of the well known Leslie–Gower type prey–predator model. The original Leslie–Gower type model has the unique interior equilibrium point which is globally asymptotically stable. We show here that the nonlinear harvesting in prey significantly modifies the dynamics of the system in comparison to the proportionate harvesting of prey. It has been observed that the system goes to extinction for a wide range of initial values. Moreover, the model can have two, one or no interior equilibrium point in the first quadrant where two interior equilibria collapse to one interior equilibrium point and then disappear through saddle-node bifurcation considering the rate of harvesting as bifurcation parameter. The local existence of limit cycle appearing through local Hopf bifurcation and its stability have also been investigated by computing first Lyapunov number. The conditions for existence of bionomic equilibria are analyzed. Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle is used to characterize the optimal singular control.

1869,A stability analysis of the power-law steady state of marine size spectra,"This paper investigates the stability of the power-law steady state often observed in marine ecosystems. Three dynamical systems are considered, describing the abundance of organisms as a function of body mass and time: a “jump-growth” equation, a first order approximation which is the widely used McKendrick–von Foerster equation, and a second order approximation which is the McKendrick–von Foerster equation with a diffusion term. All of these yield a power-law steady state. We derive, for the first time, the eigenvalue spectrum for the linearised evolution operator, under certain constraints on the parameters. This provides new knowledge of the stability properties of the power-law steady state. It is shown analytically that the steady state of the McKendrick–von Foerster equation without the diffusion term is always unstable. Furthermore, numerical plots show that eigenvalue spectra of the McKendrick–von Foerster equation with diffusion give a good approximation to those of the jump-growth equation. The steady state is more likely to be stable with a low preferred predator:prey mass ratio, a large diet breadth and a high feeding efficiency. The effects of demographic stochasticity are also investigated and it is concluded that these are likely to be small in real systems.","Samik Datta1, Gustav W. Delius2, Richard Law3 & …Michael J.

Second order differential problems with constant coefficients are considered and discretized by means of sequences of both nested and non-nested spline spaces. We prove that there always exists an asymptotic eigenvalue distribution which can be compactly described by a symbol, just like in the polynomial case. There is a complete similarity between the symbol expressions in the hyperbolic, trigonometric and polynomial cases. This results in similar spectral features of the corresponding matrices. We also analyze the IgA discretization based on trigonometric GB-splines for the eigenvalue problem related to the univariate Laplace operator. We prove that, for non-nested spaces, the phase parameter can be exploited to improve the spectral approximation with respect to the polynomial case.

After a brief introduction to the neuroanatomy and physiology of this feedback system, the paper formulates transfer functions from temporal response data available in the literature. A feedback stability analysis, based on the extension of Nyquist's stability criteria to multiple-loop systems and utilizing flow-graph techniques, demonstrates the stable behavior of the system. Expressions are given relating the sensitivity of the system to variations in muscle response and Golgi tendon organ (tension receptor) response. By considering the events taking place at synapses and end-plates during “isometric tension-small knee angle excursion” conditions as stationary stochastic processes, an external “noise” input to the system is given, whose spectrum is derived from the statistics of a shot-process representation of these events. The paper concludes with some correlations between the analytical results and clinical syndromes.",Alan R.

1874,Asymptotic Analysis of Linear Feedback Nash Equilibria in Nonzero-Sum Linear-Quadratic Differential Games,"In this paper, we discuss nonzero-sum linear-quadratic differential games. For this kind of games, the Nash equilibria for different kinds of information structures were first studied by Starr and Ho. Most of the literature on the topic of nonzero-sum linear-quadratic differential games is concerned with games of fixed, finite duration; i.e., games are studied over a finite time horizon t
f. In this paper, we study the behavior of feedback Nash equilibria for t
f→∞.In the case of memoryless perfect-state information, we study the so-called feedback Nash equilibrium. Contrary to the open-loop case, we note that the coupled Riccati equations for the feedback Nash equilibrium are inherently nonlinear. Therefore, we limit the dynamic analysis to the scalar case. For the special case that all parameters are scalar, a detailed dynamical analysis is given for the quadratic system of coupled Riccati equations. We show that the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the Riccati equations depends strongly on the specified terminal values. Finally, we show that, although the feedback Nash equilibrium over any fixed finite horizon is generically unique, there can exist several different feedback Nash equilibria in stationary strategies for the infinite-horizon problem, even when we restrict our attention to Nash equilibria that are stable in the dynamical sense.","A.

1875,Analysis of parametric models,"Parametric models in vector spaces are shown to possess an associated linear map, leading directly to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and affine/linear representations in terms of tensor products. From this map, analogues of correlation operators can be formed such that the associated linear map factorises the correlation. Its spectral decomposition and the associated Karhunen-Loève- or proper orthogonal decomposition in a tensor product follow directly, including an extension to continuous spectra. It is shown that all factorisations of a certain class are unitarily equivalent, as well as that every factorisation induces a different representation, and vice versa. No particular assumptions are made on the parameter set, other than that the vector space of real valued functions on this set allows an appropriate inner product on a subspace. A completely equivalent spectral and factorisation analysis can be carried out in kernel space. The relevance of these abstract constructions is shown on a number of mostly familiar examples, thus unifying many such constructions under one theoretical umbrella. From the factorisation, one obtains tensor representations, which may be cascaded, leading to tensors of higher degree. When carried over to a discretised level in the form of a model order reduction, such factorisations allow sparse low-rank approximations which lead to very efficient computations especially in high dimensions.","Hermann G.

1876,Numerical analysis of a new model for the processes of the one-dimensional case of metal crystallization,"The numerical analysis of a new model of metal crystallization is performed. The novelty of the model, which has recently appeared in publications, consists in modeling that is simultaneously carried out at several scale levels, from micro-to macroscales. Although experimental studies of metal crystallization revealed many details of metal crystallization, there is no comprehensive theoretical view on this phenomenon. In the model employed in this work, the space of the crystallizing alloy is assumed to be a porous medium, in which the disturbance propagation is described by Biot’s type of equations. The formation of crystal nuclei is described by a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation. A numerical scheme is constructed and its convergence is demonstrated. It is shown that various crystallization modes can be set by varying the parameters.

It is shown that the overflow traffic function \( \widehat A\left( {a,x} \right) \) is strictly convex with respect to x (number of circuits) for x ≥ 0, taking the offered traffic, a, as a positive real parameter. It is also shown that \( \widehat A\left( {a,x} \right) \) is a strictly convex function with respect to a, for all (a, x) ∈ ℝ+ × ℝ+. Following a similar process, it is shown that \( \widehat A\left( {a,x} \right) \) is a strict submodular function in this domain and that the improvement function introduced by K. O. Moe [11] is strictly increasing in a. Finally, based on some particular cases and numerous numerical results, there is a conjecture that the function \( \widehat A\left( {a,x} \right) \) is strictly jointly convex in areas of low blocking where the standard offered traffic is less than −1.","D.

We carry out stability analysis to identify the parameter zone for which the system shows a stable equilibrium response. Through the bifurcation analysis, we establish that the system shows a stable limit cycle through supercritical Hopf bifurcation beyond certain values of delay and parameters. Next, a numerical simulation of the prototype system is used to show that the system has different behaviors: stability, periodicity and chaos with the variation of delay and other parameters, which demonstrates the validity of our method. We give the single- and two-parameter bifurcation diagrams which are employed to explore the dynamics of the system over the whole parameter space.","Tianzeng Li1,2, Yu Wang1,3 & Xiaofeng Zhou",Advances in Difference Equations,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13662-019-2010-y,"Bifurcation analysis,Periodicity,Chaos,Hopf bifurcation"

1881,Global analysis of a stoichiometric producer–grazer model with Holling type functional responses,"Cells, the basic units of organisms, consist of multiple essential elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The scarcity of any of these elements can strongly restrict cellular and organismal growth. During recent years, ecological models incorporating multiple elements have been rapidly developed in many studies, which form a new research field of mathematical and theoretical biology. Among these models, the one proposed by Loladze et al. (Bull Math Biol 62:1137–1162, 2000) is prominent and has been highly cited. However, the global analysis of this nonsmooth model has never been done. The aim of this paper is to provide the complete global analysis for the model with Holling type I functional response and perform a bifurcation analysis for the model with Holling type II functional response.","Xiong Li1, Hao Wang2 & Yang Kuang",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-010-0392-2,"Stoichiometry,Producer,Grazer,Nutrient,Light,Holling type functional response,Global stability,Limit cycle,Bifurcation"
1882,Unbounded Wiener–Hopf Operators and Isomorphic Singular Integral Operators,"Some basics of a theory of unbounded Wiener–Hopf operators (WH) are developed. The alternative is shown that the domain of a WH is either zero or dense. The symbols for non-trivial WH are determined explicitly by an integrability property. WH are characterized by shift invariance. We study in detail WH with rational symbols showing that they are densely defined, closed and have finite dimensional kernels and deficiency spaces. The latter spaces as well as the domains, ranges, spectral and Fredholm points are explicitly determined. Another topic concerns semibounded WH. There is a canonical representation of a semibounded WH using a product of a closable operator and its adjoint. The Friedrichs extension is obtained replacing the operator by its closure. The polar decomposition gives rise to a Hilbert space isomorphism relating a semibounded WH to a singular integral operator of Hilbert transformation type. This remarkable relationship, which allows to transfer results and methods reciprocally, is new also in the thoroughly studied case of bounded WH.","Domenico P. L. Castrigiano

1883,Elastodynamic analysis of crack emanating from the vertex of a wedge,The method of homogeneous solutions is applied to the problem of elastodynamic crack propagation from the vertex of a wedge. The method is based on the observation that the particle velocity is self-similar. A closed form solution is obtained giving the shear stress and particle velocity in the vicinity of the moving crack tip. The corresponding quasistatic problem is also examined and it is found that the stress intensity factor for the quasi-static case is equal to that for the dynamic case when the velocity of crack propagation is very low compared to the shear wave velocity.,V.

1884,Linear programming based decomposition approach in evaluating priorities from pairwise comparisons and error analysis,"One of the most difficult issues in many real-life decisionmaking problems is how to estimate the pertinent data. An approach which uses pairwise comparisons was proposed by Saaty and is widely accepted as an effective way of determining these data. Suppose that two matrices with pairwise comparisons are available. Furthermore, suppose that there is an overlapping of the elements compared in these two matrices. The problem examined in this paper is how to combine the comparisons of the two matrices in order to derive the priorities of the elements considered in both matrices. A simple approach and a linear programming approach are formulated and analyzed in solving this problem. Computational results suggest that the LP approach, under certain conditions, is an effective way for dealing with this problem. The proposed approach is of critical importance because it can also result in a reduction of the total required number of comparisons.",E.

First, we describe numerical methods for continuation and bifurcation analysis of steady state solutions and periodic solutions of systems of delay differential equations with an arbitrary number of fixed, discrete delays. Second, we demonstrate how these methods can be used to obtain insight into complex biological regulatory systems in which interactions occur with time delays: for this, we consider a system of two equations for the plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in a diabetic patient subject to a system of external assistance. The model has two delays: the technological delay of the external system, and the physiological delay of the patient's liver. We compute stability of the steady state solution as a function of two parameters, compare with analytical results and compute several branches of periodic solutions and their stability. These numerical results allow to infer two categories of diabetic patients for which the external system has different efficiency.","K. Engelborghs1, V. Lemaire2, J. Bélair3 & …D.

These considered systems are characterized by delayed difference nonlinear equations which are given in the state form representation. Then, a transformation under the arrow form is employed. Indeed, by constructing an appropriated common Lyapunov function, and also by resorting to the Kotelyanski lemma and the M-matrix proprieties, new delay-independent stability conditions under arbitrary switching law are deduced. Compared with the existing results of switched systems, those obtained results are formulated in terms of the unknown polytopic uncertain parameters, explicit and easy to apply. Moreover, this method allows us to avoid the search for a common Lyapunov function which is a difficult matter. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",Marwen Kermani1 & Anis Sakly,Advances in Difference Equations,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1687-1847-2014-233,"discrete-time switched nonlinear time-delay systems,polytopic uncertainties,global robust asymptotic stability,M-matrix properties,Kotelyanski lemma,arrow matrix,arbitrary switching"

We take both the strong and weak kernel forms of distributed delay into consideration. The discrete time delay is chosen as the bifurcation parameter. By analyzing the distribution of characteristic values, we obtain the sufficient conditions of stability and examine the existence of periodic oscillations. When the discrete time delay is small and not greater than the threshold, the equilibrium of the gene expression model is asymptotically stable. When the bifurcation parameter exceeds the critical value, the model can produce limit cycles. Finally, numerical simulations are implemented to verify the correctness of our theoretical results.","Fan Qing1, Min Xiao1,2, Chengdai Huang3, Guoping Jiang1, Jianlong Qiu4, Jinxing Lin1, Zhengxin Wang5 & …Cong Zheng",Advances in Difference Equations,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13662-019-2180-7,"Hopf bifurcation,Local stability,Periodic oscillation,Distributed delay,Genetic expression model"

iφ(t) and \(\hat{s}(\omega)=B(\omega)e^{i\psi(\omega)}\), where the amplitude functions A(t) and B(ω) and the phase functions φ(t) and ψ(ω) are assumed to be differentiable. They include the amplitude-phase representations of the first and second order means of the Fourier frequency and time, and the equivalence between two forms of the covariance. A proof of the uncertainty principle is also based on the amplitude-phase representations. In general, however, signals of finite energy do not necessarily have differentiable amplitude-phase representations. The study presented in this paper extends the classical formulas and relations to general signals of finite energy. Under the formulation of the phase and amplitude derivatives based on the Hardy-Sobolev spaces decomposition the extended formulas reveal new features, and contribute to the foundations of time-frequency analysis. The established theory is based on the equivalent classes of the L

The dynamic behavior of the underlined map is discussed in two different cases: the first case is when the parameter of the map being real, and the second case is when the parameter being complex. Existence and stability of fixed points are derived. The conditions for existence of a pitchfork bifurcation, flip bifurcation and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation are derived by using the center manifold theorem and bifurcation theory. Numerical simulations including Lyapunov exponent, phase plane, bifurcation diagrams is carried out using matlab to ensure theoretical results and to reveal more complex dynamics of the map. The results show that expressing the logistic map in terms of complex variables leads to more distinguished behaviors, which could not be achieved in the logistic map with real variables. In addition, considering the control parameter as a complex parameter shows more interesting dynamics if compared to the case when considering it as a real parameter.

The limit kernels describe the asymptotic behavior of large rows and columns of the corresponding random Young diagrams, and the behavior of the Young diagrams near the diagonal.Our results show that recently discovered analogy between random partitions arising in representation theory and spectra of random matrices extends to the associated time– dependent models.",Alexei Borodin1 & Grigori Olshanski,Probability Theory and Related Fields,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-005-0458-z,"Correlation Function,Stochastic Process,Asymptotic Behavior,Harmonic Analysis,Markov Process"

1904,Sato–Tate theorem for families and low-lying zeros of automorphic \(L\)-functions,"We consider certain families of automorphic representations over number fields arising from the principle of functoriality of Langlands. Let \(G\) be a reductive group over a number field \(F\) which admits discrete series representations at infinity. Let \(^{L}G=\widehat{G} \rtimes \mathrm{Gal}(\bar{F}/F)\) be the associated \(L\)-group and \(r:{}^L G\rightarrow \mathrm{GL}(d,\mathbb {C})\) a continuous homomorphism which is irreducible and does not factor through \(\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{F}/F)\). The families under consideration consist of discrete automorphic representations of \(G(\mathbb {A}_F)\) of given weight and level and we let either the weight or the level grow to infinity. We establish a quantitative Plancherel and a quantitative Sato–Tate equidistribution theorem for the Satake parameters of these families. This generalizes earlier results in the subject, notably of Sarnak (Prog Math 70:321–331, 1987) and Serre (J Am Math Soc 10(1):75–102, 1997). As an application we study the distribution of the low-lying zeros of the associated family of \(L\)-functions \(L(s,\pi ,r)\), assuming from the principle of functoriality that these \(L\)-functions are automorphic. We find that the distribution of the \(1\)-level densities coincides with the distribution of the \(1\)-level densities of eigenvalues of one of the unitary, symplectic and orthogonal ensembles, in accordance with the Katz–Sarnak heuristics. We provide a criterion based on the Frobenius–Schur indicator to determine this symmetry type. If \(r\) is not isomorphic to its dual \(r^\vee \) then the symmetry type is unitary. Otherwise there is a bilinear form on \(\mathbb {C}^d\) which realizes the isomorphism between \(r\) and \(r^\vee \). If the bilinear form is symmetric (resp. alternating) then \(r\) is real (resp. quaternionic) and the symmetry type is symplectic (resp. orthogonal).","Sug Woo Shin1,2 & Nicolas Templier",Inventiones mathematicae,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-015-0583-y,"11F55,11F67,11F70,11F72,11F75,14L15,20G30,22E30,22E35"

1908,Analysis of Approximate Inverses in Tomography I. Resolution Analysis of Common Inverses,"The process of using physical data to produce images of important physical parameters is an inversion problem, and these are often called tomographic inverse problems when the arrangement of sources and receivers makes an analogy to x-ray tomographic methods used in medical imaging possible. Examples of these methods in geophysics include seismic tomography, ocean acoustic tomography, electrical resistance tomography, etc., and many other examples could be given in nondestructive evaluation and other applications. All these imaging methods have two stages: First, the data are operated upon in some fashion to produce the image of the desired physical quantity. Second, the resulting image must be evaluated in essentially the same timeframe as the image is being used as a diagnostic tool. If the resolution provided by the image is good enough, then a reliable diagnosis may ensue. If the resolution is not good enough, then a reliable diagnosis is probably not possible. But the first question in this second stage is always &#x201C;How good is the resolution?&#x201D; The concept of resolution operators and resolution matrices has permeated the geophysics literature since the work of Backus and Gilbert in the late 1960s. But measures of resolution have not always been computed as often as they should be because, for very data rich problems, these computations can actually be significantly more difficult/expensive than computing the image itself.It is the purpose of this paper and its companion (Part II) to show how resolution operators/matrices can be computed economically in almost all cases, and to provide a means of comparing the resolution characteristics of many of the common approximate inverse methods. Part I will introduce the main ideas and analyze the behavior of standard methods such as damped least-squares, truncated singular value decomposition, the adjoint method, backprojection formulas, etc. Part II will treat many of the standard iterative inversion methods including conjugate gradients, Lanczos, LSQR, etc.",James G.

1910,Operator Scaling: Theory and Applications,"In this paper, we present a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for testing whether a symbolic matrix in non-commuting variables over \({\mathbb {Q}}\) is invertible or not. The analogous question for commuting variables is the celebrated polynomial identity testing (PIT) for symbolic determinants. In contrast to the commutative case, which has an efficient probabilistic algorithm, the best previous algorithm for the non-commutative setting required exponential time (Ivanyos et al. in Comput Complex 26(3):717–763, 2017) (whether or not randomization is allowed). The algorithm efficiently solves the “word problem” for the free skew field, and the identity testing problem for arithmetic formulae with division over non-commuting variables, two problems which had only exponential time algorithms prior to this work. The main contribution of this paper is a complexity analysis of an existing algorithm due to Gurvits (J Comput Syst Sci 69(3):448–484, 2004), who proved it was polynomial time for certain classes of inputs. We prove it always runs in polynomial time. The main component of our analysis is a simple (given the necessary known tools) lower bound on central notion of capacity of operators (introduced by Gurvits 2004). We extend the algorithm to actually approximate capacity to any accuracy in polynomial time, and use this analysis to give quantitative bounds on the continuity of capacity (the latter is used in a subsequent paper on Brascamp–Lieb inequalities). We also extend the algorithm to compute not only singularity, but actually the (non-commutative) rank of a symbolic matrix, yielding a factor 2 approximation of the commutative rank. This naturally raises a relaxation of the commutative PIT problem to achieving better deterministic approximation of the commutative rank. Symbolic matrices in non-commuting variables, and the related structural and algorithmic questions, have a remarkable number of diverse origins and motivations. They arise independently in (commutative) invariant theory and representation theory, linear algebra, optimization, linear system theory, quantum information theory, approximation of the permanent and naturally in non-commutative algebra. We provide a detailed account of some of these sources and their interconnections. In particular, we explain how some of these sources played an important role in the development of Gurvits’ algorithm and in our analysis of it here.","Ankit Garg1, Leonid Gurvits2, Rafael Oliveira3 & …Avi Wigderson",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-019-09417-z,"Derandomization,Non-commutative algebra,Polynomial identity testing,Invariant theory,Quantum operators"

Those representations turn order relations between positive operators to order relations between real functions. Two of them turn the usual Löwner order between operators to the pointwise order between functions, another two turn the spectral order between operators to the same, pointwise order between functions. We investigate which algebraic operations those representations preserve, hence which kind of algebraic structure the representing functions have. We study the differences among the different representing functions of the same positive operator. Finally, we introduce a new complete metric (which corresponds naturally to two of those representations) on the set of all invertible positive operators and formulate a conjecture concerning the corresponding isometry group.","Lajos Molnár

\({\Pi^1_2}\) -comprehension and the property of Ramsey","We show that a theory of autonomous iterated Ramseyness based on second order arithmetic (SOA) is proof-theoretically equivalent to \({\Pi^1_2}\) -comprehension. The property of Ramsey is defined as follows. Let X be a set of real numbers, i.e. a set of infinite sets of natural numbers. We call a set H of natural numbers homogeneous for X if either all infinite subsets of H are in X or all infinite subsets of H are not in X. X has the property of Ramsey if there exists a set which is homogeneous for X. The property of Ramsey is considered in reverse mathematics to compare the strength of subsystems of SOA. To characterize the system of \({\Pi^1_2}\) -comprehension in terms of Ramseyness we introduce a system of autonomous iterated Ramseyness, called R-calculus. We augment the language of SOA with additional set terms (called R-terms) \({R\vec{x}X\phi(\vec{x},X)}\) for each first order formula \({\phi(\vec{x},X)}\) (where φ may contain further R-terms). The R-calculus is a system which comprises comprehension for all first order formulas (which may contain R-terms or other set parameters) and defining axioms for the R-terms which claim that for each \({\vec{x}}\) , we can remove finitely many elements from the set \({R\vec{x}X\phi(\vec{x},X)}\) such that the remaining set is homogeneous for \({\{{X}{\phi(\vec{x},X)\}}}\) .

1914,Ultrametric Cantor sets and growth of measure,"A class of ultrametric Cantor sets (C, d

u
) introduced recently (S. Raut and D. P. Datta, Fractals 17, 45–52 (2009)) is shown to enjoy some novel properties. The ultrametric d

u
 is defined using the concept of relative infinitesimals and an inversion rule. The associated (infinitesimal) valuation which turns out to be both scale and reparametrization invariant, is identified with the Cantor function associated with a Cantor set \( \tilde C \)
, where the relative infinitesimals are supposed to live in. These ultrametrics are both metrically as well as topologically inequivalent compared to the topology induced by the usual metric. Every point of the original Cantor set C is identified with the closure of the set of gaps of \( \tilde C \)
. The increments on such an ultrametric space is accomplished by following the inversion rule. As a consequence, Cantor functions are reinterpreted as locally constant functions on these extended ultrametric spaces. An interesting phenomenon, called growth of measure, is studied on such an ultrametric space. Using the reparametrization invariance of the valuation it is shown how the scale factors of a Lebesgue measure zero Cantor set might get deformed leading to a deformed Cantor set with a positive measure. The definition of a new valuated exponent is introduced which is shown to yield the fatness exponent in the case of a positive measure (fat) Cantor set. However, the valuated exponent can also be used to distinguish Cantor sets with identical Hausdorff dimension and thickness. A class of Cantor sets with Hausdorff dimension log3 2 and thickness 1 are constructed explicitly.","Dhurjati Prasad Datta1, Santanu Raut2 & Anuja Raychoudhuri","P-Adic Numbers, Ultrametric Analysis, and Applications",2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S207004661101002X,"ultrametric,Cantor set,Cantor function,scale invariance,measure"

1916,Heuristic evaluation techniques for bin packing approximation algorithms,"Performance analysis of approximation algorithms purposes to give upper bounds on the ratio «approximate solution cost»/«optimal solution cost». We say that standard analysis brings to «a priori» evaluation since the bounds it provides refer to the overall worst-case performance: really those evaluations do not take into account useful information relevant to the performance that approximate solution might contain themselves. In this paper we show how the performances of the Any Fit Decreasing algorithms for Bin Packing can be evaluated more precisely than it is done in the standard «a priori» analysis, by means of demonstration techniques of «a posteriori» analysis. In fact, we show how approximate solutions of Bin Packing given by Any Fit Decreasing algorithms can be put in three classes of performances. Belongings to the first class imply really optimality of solutions (those events could remain unspected if one clings only to the 5/4 bound, as forecast by standard «a priori» evaluations). Also belonging to the second class of performances may involve remarkable revaluation of solutions in hand, although optimality cannot be recognized; an inequality is provided which permits to compute upper bounds on the evaluation ratios. The same inequality permits to recognize approximate solutions which could not be improved neither by First Fit nor Best Fit Decreasing algorithms. The third class refers to those performances for which the considered levels of inspection cannot offer a more precise evaluation that the «a priori» one.","A. Aiello1, E. Burattini1, A.

The zero of a level set function is used to specify the location of the discontinuity. Since a level set function is used to describe the front location, no extra data structures are needed to keep track of the location of the discontinuity. Also, two solution states are used at all computational nodes, one corresponding to the “real” state, and one corresponding to a “ghost node” state, analogous to the “Ghost Fluid Method” of [12]. High order pointwise convergence was demonstrated for scalar linear and nonlinear conservation laws, even at discontinuities and in multiple dimensions in the first paper of this series [3]. The solutions here are compared to standard high order shock capturing schemes, when appropriate.

1921,Holomorphic Foliations Tangent to Levi-Flat Subsets,"An irreducible real analytic subvariety H of real dimension \(2n +1\) in a complex manifold M is a Levi-flat subset if its regular part carries a complex foliation of dimension n. Locally, a germ of real analytic Levi-flat subset is contained in a germ of irreducible complex variety \(H^{\imath }\) of dimension \(n+1\), called intrinsic complexification, which can be globalized to a neighborhood of H in M provided H is a coherent analytic subvariety. In this case, a singular holomorphic foliation \(\mathcal {F}\) of dimension n in M that is tangent to H is also tangent to \(H^{\imath }\). In this paper, we prove integration results of local and global nature for the restriction to \(H^{\imath }\) of a singular holomorphic foliation \(\mathcal {F}\) tangent to a real analytic Levi-flat subset H. From a local viewpoint, if \(n=1\) and \(H^{\imath }\) has an isolated singularity, then \(\mathcal {F}|_{H^{\imath }}\) has a meromorphic first integral. From a global perspective, when \(M = \mathbb {P}^N\) and H is coherent and of low codimension, \(H^{\imath }\) extends to an algebraic variety. In this case, \(\mathcal {F}|_{H^{\imath }}\) has a rational first integral provided infinitely many leaves of \(\mathcal {F}\) in H are algebraic.","Jane Bretas1, Arturo Fernández-Pérez

1922," Functors and Computations in Floer Homology with Applications, I"," This paper is concerned with Floer cohomology of manifolds with contact type boundary. In this case, there is no conjecture on this ring, as opposed to the compact case, where it is isomorphic to the usual cohomology (with the quantum product). We construct two mappings in Floer cohomology and prove some functorial properties of these two mappings. The first one is a map from the Floer cohomology of M to the relative cohomology of M modulo its boundary. The other is associated to a codimension zero embedding, and may be considered as a cohomological transfer. These maps are used to define some properties of symplectic manifolds with contact type boundary. These are algebraic versions of the Weinstein conjecture, asserting existence of closed characteristics on \(\partial M\). This is proved for many cases, Euclidean space and subcritical Stein manifolds, vector bundles, products, cotangent bundles. It is also proved that the above property implies some restrictions on Lagrangian embeddings, and also yields in certain cases, existence results for holomorphic curves bounded by the Lagrange submanifold. The last section is devoted to applications of this existence result, to real forms of Stein manifolds and obstructions to polynomial convexity in Stein manifolds. Many of our applications rely on the computation of the Floer cohomology of a cotangent bundle, that is the subject of Part II.

The present research examines the Camera di Giove, a vaulted room located in the Ducal Palace of Sassuolo, an important residence of the Este family. The chamber represents a typical Baroque example of an extension of spatial perception, thanks to the relationship with the nearby rooms and the vertical perspective of the vaulted painting.

Such problems arise often in theory and practice, particularly in engineering design, and are amenable to a rich blend of classical mathematical techniques and contemporary optimization theory. This essay presents a personal choice of some central mathematical ideas, outlined for the broad optimization community. I discuss the convex analysis of spectral functions and invariant matrix norms, touching briefly on semidefinite representability, and then outlining two broader algebraic viewpoints based on hyperbolic polynomials and Lie algebra. Analogous nonconvex notions lead into eigenvalue perturbation theory.

1925,"Zero-convex functions, perturbation resilience, and subgradient projections for feasibility-seeking methods","The convex feasibility problem (CFP) is at the core of the modeling of many problems in various areas of science. Subgradient projection methods are important tools for solving the CFP because they enable the use of subgradient calculations instead of orthogonal projections onto the individual sets of the problem. Working in a real Hilbert space, we show that the sequential subgradient projection method is perturbation resilient. By this we mean that under appropriate conditions the sequence generated by the method converges weakly, and sometimes also strongly, to a point in the intersection of the given subsets of the feasibility problem, despite certain perturbations which are allowed in each iterative step. Unlike previous works on solving the convex feasibility problem, the involved functions, which induce the feasibility problem’s subsets, need not be convex. Instead, we allow them to belong to a wider and richer class of functions satisfying a weaker condition, that we call “zero-convexity”. This class, which is introduced and discussed here, holds a promise to solve optimization problems in various areas, especially in non-smooth and non-convex optimization. The relevance of this study to approximate minimization and to the recent superiorization methodology for constrained optimization is explained.",Yair Censor1 & Daniel Reem,Mathematical Programming,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-014-0788-7,"Feasibility problem,Perturbation resilience,Subgradient projection method,Superiorization,Voronoi function,Zero-convexity"
1926,Birth and death processes on certain random trees: classification and stationary laws,"The main substance of the paper concerns the growth rate and the classification (ergodicity, transience) of a family of random trees. In the basic model, new edges appear according to a Poisson process of parameter λ and leaves can be deleted at a rate μ. The main results lay the stress on the famous number e. A complete classification of the process is given in terms of the intensity factor ρ=λ/μ: it is ergodic if ρ≤e
−1, and transient if ρ>e
−1. There is a phase transition phenomenon: the usual region of null recurrence (in the parameter space) here does not exist. This fact is rare for countable Markov chains with exponentially distributed jumps. Some basic stationary laws are computed, e.g. the number of vertices and the height. Various bounds, limit laws and ergodic-like theorems are obtained, both for the transient and ergodic regimes. In particular, when the system is transient, the height of the tree grows linearly as the time t→∞, at a rate which is explicitly computed. Some of the results are extended to the so-called multiclass model.

1928,Modal approximation for plasmonic resonators in the time domain: the scalar case,"We study the electromagnetic field scattered by a metallic nanoparticle with dispersive material parameters in a resonant regime. We consider the particle placed in a homogeneous medium in a low-frequency regime. We define modes for the non-Hermitian problem as perturbations of electro-static modes, and obtain a modal approximation of the scattered field in the frequency domain. The poles of the expansion correspond to the eigenvalues of a singular boundary integral operator and are shown to lie in a bounded region near the origin of the lower-half complex plane. Finally, we show that this modal representation gives a very good approximation of the field in the time domain. We present numerical simulations in two dimensions to corroborate our results.","Lorenzo Baldassari

1930,Computer-assisted generation of robot dynamic models in an analytical form,An algorithm for constructing dynamic models of single-arm robots is presented in this paper. Motion equations of robots in analytical form are derived applying a fully automated procedure. It is shown that the solution of a direct and/or inverse problem based on the analytical model requires considerably fewer floating-point multiplications/additions than is the case with previously-developed numerical methods. The developed method is therefore very suitable for real-time application of robot dynamic models. The developed program package is illustrated using the example of Stanford manipulator.,M.

1931,Geminus and the concept of mean motion in Greco-Latin astronomy,"
Geminus account of lunar motion in chapter 18 of hisIntroductio astronomiae is, in our view, an important contribution to Greco-Latin astronomy because, in attempting to reconstruct arithmetically (the parameters of) the Moon's motion in longitude, he undermines the task astronomers had hitherto set for themselves. This undermining of a commonly acknowledged view of the purpose of astronomy is articulated in a whole new set of questions concerning the nature and place of both observation and mathematical reasoning in the science of the heavens. Yet, one must not overlook the fact thatGeminus reconstruction also indicates resources for addressing these questions. Of these resources, the most powerful proved to be the idea that irregular motion could be quantified as a systematic departure from a mean motion, and the idea that observational data could be organized and structured by means of genetic arithmetical reconstructions.But, since we limit our attention to extant treatises and decline to speculate about works or parts of works that have not survived, we must say that it would takePtolemy to discern the new direction for astronomy thatGeminus opened up and to pursue it. In part, this involved straightening out the conflated conception of mean motion in chapter 18 — the μεση κίνησίςqua arithmetic mean daily displacement can only be anapparent lunar motion in longitude and not one the Moonreally makes, but the same need not be true of the μέση κίνησιςqua periodic mean daily displacement — and determining its proper relation to real and apparent planetary motion. Indeed,Ptolemy's genius lay, we think, in seeing that even though, in assimilating Babylonian astronomy, earlier and contemporary Greco-Latin writers betrayed a confused, inconsistent, and unsophisticated grasp of the proper role of arithmetic, geometry, and observation in astronomical argument [seeBowen 1994], the solution lay in a mathematical reconstruction of the observed celestial motions, in which mean motion played an essential role.","Alan C.

1932,Collapse Versus Blow-Up and Global Existence in the Generalized Constantin–Lax–Majda Equation,"The question of finite-time singularity formation versus global existence for solutions to the generalized Constantin–Lax–Majda equation is studied, with particular emphasis on the influence of a parameter a which controls the strength of advection. For solutions on the infinite domain, we find a new critical value \(a_c=0.6890665337007457\ldots \) below which there is finite-time singularity formation that has a form of self-similar collapse, with the spatial extent of blow-up shrinking to zero. We prove the existence of a leading-order power-law complex singularity for general values of a in the analytical continuation of the solution from the real spatial coordinate into the complex plane and identify the power-law exponent. This singularity controls the leading-order behavior of the collapsing solution. We prove that this singularity can persist over time, without other singularity types present, provided \(a=0\) or 1/2. This enables the construction of exact analytical solutions for these values of a. For other values of a, this leading-order singularity must coexist with other singularity types over any nonzero interval of time. For \(a_c<a\le 1\), we find a blow-up solution in which the spatial extent of the blow-up region expands infinitely fast at the singularity time. For \(a \gtrsim 1.3\) , we find that the solution exists globally with exponential-like growth of the solution amplitude in time. We also consider the case of periodic boundary conditions. We identify collapsing solutions for \(a<a_c\) which are similar to the real line case. For \(a_c<a\le 0.95\), we find new blow-up solutions which are neither expanding nor collapsing. For \( a\ge 1,\) we identify a global existence of solutions.","Pavel M. Lushnikov

Using a functional model of a nonself-adjoint operator (a generalization of a Sz.-Nagy–Foiaş model for dissipative operators) as a principle tool, spectral properties of such operators are investigated. A class of operators with almost Hermitian spectrum (the latter being a part of the real singular spectrum) is characterized in terms of existence of the so-called weak outer annihilator which generalizes the classical Cayley identity to the case of nonself-adjoint operators in Hilbert space. A similar result is proved in the self-adjoint case, characterizing the condition of absence of the absolutely continuous spectral subspace in terms of the existence of weak outer annihilation. An application to the rank-one nonself-adjoint Friedrichs model is given. ",Alexander V.

We show that the problem reduces to a bifurcation problem in the hyperbolic plane \(\mathcal {D}\) (Poincaré disc). We make use of the concept of a periodic lattice in \(\mathcal {D}\) to further reduce the problem to one on a compact Riemann surface \(\mathcal {D}/\varGamma\), where Γ is a cocompact, torsion-free Fuchsian group. The knowledge of the symmetry group of this surface allows us to use the machinery of equivariant bifurcation theory. Solutions which generically bifurcate are called “H-planforms”, by analogy with the “planforms” introduced for pattern formation in Euclidean space. This concept is applied to the case of an octagonal periodic pattern, where we are able to classify all possible H-planforms satisfying the hypotheses of the Equivariant Branching Lemma. These patterns are, however, not straightforward to compute, even numerically, and in the last section we describe a method for computation illustrated with a selection of images of octagonal H-planforms.","Pascal Chossat1,2,3, Grégory Faye1,2 & Olivier Faugeras1,",Journal of Nonlinear Science,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00332-010-9089-3,"Equivariant bifurcation analysis,Neural fields,Poincaré disc,Periodic lattices,Hyperbolic planforms,Irreducible representations,Laplace–Beltrami operator"

M
 for M→∞ were provided by Hensley (J. Number Theory 40:336–358, 1992). In the rational case, first studies by Cusick (Mathematika 24:166–172, 1997), Hensley (In: Proc. Int. Conference on Number Theory, Quebec, pp. 371–385, 1987) and Vallée (J. Number Theory 72:183–235, 1998) considered the case of a fixed bound M when the denominator N tends to ∞. Later, Hensley (Pac. J. Math. 151(2):237–255, 1991) dealt with the case of a bound M which may depend on the denominator N, and obtained a precise estimate on the cardinality of rational numbers of denominator less than N whose digits (in the continued fraction expansion) are less than M(N), provided the bound M(N) is large enough with respect to N. This paper improves this last result of Hensley towards four directions. First, it considers various continued fraction expansions; second, it deals with various probability settings (and not only the uniform probability); third, it studies the case of all possible sequences M(N), with the only restriction that M(N) is at least equal to a given constant M
0; fourth, it refines the estimates due to Hensley, in the cases that are studied by Hensley. This paper also generalises previous estimates due to Hensley (J. Number Theory 40:336–358, 1992) about the Hausdorff dimension σ

M

Second, we show that the convergence rate of such functional approximations can be exponential, depending on the regularity of the functional (in particular its Fréchet differentiability), and its domain. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency, stability and convergence of cylindrical approximations to linear FDEs. These results open the possibility to utilize numerical techniques for high-dimensional systems such as deep neural networks and numerical tensor methods to approximate nonlinear functionals in terms of high-dimensional functions, and compute approximate solutions to FDEs by solving high-dimensional PDEs.

The reported cases have been used for obtaining the real parameters and the basic reproduction number for the given period, \(\mathcal{R}_{0}\approx 6.6361\).

1953,Dynamics of Welfare of the Population of a Country,"
The author shows that there is a limit in economy at which the rate of growth of GDP becomes less than the rate of growth of welfare; and to maintain current welfare, the population decreases by birth rate decrease. In post-industrial economies, the welfare of population is retained and grows due to budget deficit paid off by borrowing. Under the conditions of the world economic crisis lasting since 2008, hasty growth of debt service payments with the retention of welfare of the population will result in bankruptcy of post-industrial economies.

The currency rate is determined by the function that is directly proportional to monetary inflation and real consumer demand and is inversely proportional to the currency intervention of the Central Bank and transactions.",B.

1956,"Structure, classification, and conformal symmetry of elementary particles over non-archimedean space-time","It is well known that at distances shorter than Planck length, no length measurements are possible. The Volovich hypothesis asserts that at sub-Planckian distances and times, spacetime itself has a non-Archimedean geometry. We discuss the structure of elementary particles, their classification, and their conformal symmetry under this hypothesis. Specifically, we investigate the projective representations of the p-adic Poincaré and Galilean groups, using a new variant of the Mackey machine for projective unitary representations of semidirect products of locally compact and second countable (lcsc) groups. We construct the conformal spacetime over p-adic fields and discuss the imbedding of the p-adic Poincaré group into the p-adic conformal group. Finally, we show that the massive and the so called eventually masssive particles of the Poincaré group do not have conformal symmetry. The whole picture bears a close resemblance to what happens over the field of real numbers, but with some significant variations.",V. S. Varadarajan1 & Jukka T.

1957,New slope methods for sharper interval functions and a note on Fischer's acceleration method,"This paper presents algorithms evaluating sharper bounds for interval functionsF(X) :IR

n. All methods can be implemented using tools that automatically evaluate gradient and slope vectors by using a forward strategy, so the complex management of reverse accumulation methods is avoided. The sharpest methods compute each component of gradients and slopes separately, by substituting each interval variable at a time. Backward methods bring no great advantage in the sharpest algorithms, since object-oriented forward implementations are easy and immediate.Fischer's acceleration scheme [2] was also tested with interval variables. This method allows the direct evaluation of the productf′(x) * (x−z) as a single real number (instead of working with two vectors) and we used it to computeF′(X) * (X−z) for an interval vectorX. We are led to decide against such acceleration when interval variables are involved.",João B.

1961,Interactions among biological systems: An analysis of asymptotic stability,An analysis of the interactions among asymptotically stable dynamical systems is formulated by making use of the dynamical system theory. Some results coming from previous mathematical analyses have been slightly modified to take into account some typical biological constraints as the boundedness properties of the solutions. In particular it has been shown that when the “coupling” among the subsystems is “loose” enough (in a sense that has to be made mathematically precise) the asymptotic behaviour of a complex system is the same of that of its individual components. The mathematical theory has been used to analyze two systems of biological significance: the coupling among chemical reactions and the stability properties of a 4-dimensional system describing the kinetics of a chemical transmitter.,Francesco Andrietti,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,1978,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02460610,"Asymptotic Stability,Composite System,Negative Real Part,Dynamical System Theory,Boundedness Property"

We prove a backward error analysis result for intrinsic numerical methods. Especially we are interested in Lie-group methods. If the Lie algebra is nilpotent a global stability analysis can be done in the Lie algebra. In the general case we must work on the nonlinear Lie group. In order to show that there is a perturbed differential equation on the Lie group with a solution that is exponentially close to the numerical integrator after several steps, we prove a generalised version of Alekseev-Gr: obner's theorem. A major motivation for this result is that it implies many stability properties of Lie-group methods.",S.

1964,A Nonlinear Stability Analysis of Vegetative Turing Pattern Formation for an Interaction–Diffusion Plant-Surface Water Model System in an Arid Flat Environment,"The development of spontaneous stationary vegetative patterns in an arid flat environment is investigated by means of a weakly nonlinear diffusive instability analysis applied to the appropriate model system for this phenomenon. In particular, that process can be modeled by a partial differential interaction–diffusion equation system for the plant biomass density and the surface water content defined on an unbounded flat spatial domain. The main results of this analysis can be represented by closed-form plots in the rate of precipitation versus the specific rate of plant density loss parameter space. From these plots, regions corresponding to bare ground and vegetative patterns consisting of parallel stripes, labyrinth-like mazes, hexagonal arrays of gaps, irregular mosaics, and homogeneous distributions of vegetation, respectively, may be identified in this parameter space. Then those theoretical predictions are compared with both relevant observational evidence involving tiger and pearled bush patterns and existing numerical simulations of similar model systems as well as placed in the context of the results from some recent nonlinear vegetative pattern formation studies.",Bonni J.

1965,Stability Issues of Entropy-Stable and/or Split-form High-order Schemes,"The focus of the present research is on the analysis of local energy stability of high-order (including split-form) summation-by-parts methods, with e.g. two-point entropy-conserving fluxes, approximating non-linear conservation laws. Our main finding is that local energy stability, i.e., the numerical growth rate does not exceed the growth rate of the continuous problem, is not guaranteed even when the scheme is non-linearly stable and that this may have adverse implications for simulation results. We show that entropy-conserving two-point fluxes are inherently locally energy unstable, as they can be dissipative or anti-dissipative. Unfortunately, these fluxes are at the core of many commonly used high-order entropy-stable extensions, including split-form summation-by-parts discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods (or spectral collocation methods). For the non-linear Burgers equation, we further demonstrate numerically that such schemes cause exponential growth of errors during the simulation. Furthermore, we encounter a similar abnormal behaviour for the compressible Euler equations, for a smooth exact solution of a density wave. Finally, for the same case, we demonstrate numerically that other commonly known split-forms, such as the Kennedy and Gruber splitting, are also locally energy unstable.","Gregor J. Gassner

1966,Analysis and visualization of disease courses in a semantically-enabled cancer registry,"BackgroundRegional and epidemiological cancer registries are important for cancer research and the quality management of cancer treatment. Many technological solutions are available to collect and analyse data for cancer registries nowadays. However, the lack of a well-defined common semantic model is a problem when user-defined analyses and data linking to external resources are required. The objectives of this study are: (1) design of a semantic model for local cancer registries; (2) development of a semantically-enabled cancer registry based on this model; and (3) semantic exploitation of the cancer registry for analysing and visualising disease courses.ResultsOur proposal is based on our previous results and experience working with semantic technologies. Data stored in a cancer registry database were transformed into RDF employing a process driven by OWL ontologies. The semantic representation of the data was then processed to extract semantic patient profiles, which were exploited by means of SPARQL queries to identify groups of similar patients and to analyse the disease timelines of patients.Based on the requirements analysis, we have produced a draft of an ontology that models the semantics of a local cancer registry in a pragmatic extensible way. We have implemented a Semantic Web platform that allows transforming and storing data from cancer registries in RDF. This platform also permits users to formulate incremental user-defined queries through a graphical user interface. The query results can be displayed in several customisable ways. The complex disease timelines of individual patients can be clearly represented. Different events, e.g. different therapies and disease courses, are presented according to their temporal and causal relations.ConclusionThe presented platform is an example of the parallel development of ontologies and applications that take advantage of semantic web technologies in the medical field. The semantic structure of the representation renders it easy to analyse key figures of the patients and their evolution at different granularity levels.","Angel Esteban-Gil1, Jesualdo Tomás Fernández-Breis

1967,Spatial stability analysis of Eigen's quasispecies model and the less than five membered hypercycle under global population regulation,"A generalization of the “constant overall organization” constraint of Eigen's quasispecies and hypercycle models, called herein “global population regulation”, is shown to lead to mathematically tractable spatial generalizations of these two models. The spatially uniform steady state of Eigen's quasispecies model is shown to be stable and globally attracting for all possible values of the mutation and replication rates. In contrast, the spatially and temporally uniform solutions to the hypercycle with fewer than five members, the only ones insensitive to stochastic perturbations, are shown to be unstable, and a lower bound to the spatial inhomogeneities is obtained. The prospect that the spatially localized hypercycle might be immune to various instabilities cited in the literature is then briefly considered. Although spatial localization makes possible a much richer dynamical repertoire than previously considered, it is also more difficult to understand how Darwinian selection of hypercycles could result in a unique genetic code.",Edward D.

The model is set on \(\mathbb{R}^N\), with periodic heterogeneous coefficients obtained using stochastic processes. Using a criterion of species persistence based on the notion of principal eigenvalue of an elliptic operator, we provided a precise numerical analysis of the interactions between habitat fragmentation and species persistence. The obtained results clearly indicated that species persistence strongly tends to decrease with habitat fragmentation. Moreover, comparing two stochastic models of landscape pattern generation, we observed that in addition to local fragmentation, a more global effect of the position of the habitat patches also influenced species persistence.",Lionel Roques1 & Radu S.

            ","The goal of dimensionality reduction or manifold learning for a given set of high-dimensional data points, is to find a low-dimensional parametrization for them. Usually it is easy to carry out this parametrization process within a small region to produce a collection of local coordinate systems. Alignment is the process to stitch those local systems together to produce a global coordinate system and is done through the computation of a partial eigendecomposition of a so-called alignment matrix. In this paper, we present an analysis of the alignment process, giving conditions under which the null space of the alignment matrix recovers the global coordinate system up to an affine transformation. We also propose a post-processing step that can determine the global coordinate system up to a rigid motion. This in turn shows that Local Tangent Space Alignment method (LTSA) can recover a locally isometric embedding up to a rigid motion.

1971,Traveling waves in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation,"In this paper we consider a modulation (or amplitude) equation that appears in the nonlinear stability analysis of reversible or nearly reversible systems. This equation is the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with coefficients with small imaginary parts. We regard this equation as a perturbation of the real Ginzburg-Landau equation and study the persistence of the properties of the stationary solutions of the real equation under this perturbation. First we show that it is necessary to consider a two-parameter family of traveling solutions with wave speedυ and (temporal) frequencyθ; these solutions are the natural continuations of the stationary solutions of the real equation. We show that there exists a two-parameter family of traveling quasiperiodic solutions that can be regarded as a direct continuation of the two-parameter family of spatially quasi-periodic solutions of the integrable stationary real Ginzburg-Landau equation. We explicitly determine a region in the (wave speedυ, frequencyθ)-parameter space in which the weakly complex Ginzburg-Landau equation has traveling quasi-periodic solutions. There are two different one-parameter families of heteroclinic solutions in the weakly complex case. One of them consists of slowly varying plane waves; the other is directly related to the analytical solutions due to Bekki & Nozaki [3]. These solutions correspond to traveling localized structures that connect two different periodic patterns. The connections correspond to a one-parameter family of heteroclinic cycles in an o.d.e. reduction. This family of cycles is obtained by determining the limit behaviour of the traveling quasi-periodic solutions as the period of the amplitude goes to ∞. Therefore, the heteroclinic cycles merge into the stationary homoclinic solution of the real Ginzburg-Landau equation in the limit in which the imaginary terms disappear.",A.

Some new identities and sums for anisotropic piezoelectric media are also derived, through which real-form expressions for the stresses and electric displacements along the interface as well as the rotation of the rigid inclusion can be obtained. As is expected, the stresses and electric displacements at the tips of the debonded part of the interface exhibit the same singular behavior as in the case of a straight Griffith interface crack between dissimilar piezoelectric media. Some numerical examples are presented to validate the correctness of the obtained solution and also to illustrate the generality of the exact solution and the effects of various electromechanical loading conditions, geometry parameters and material constants on the distribution of stresses and electric displacements along the interface.",Wang Xu1 & Shen Ya-peng,Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02437943,"holomorphic function,Stroh formula,conformal mapping,conducting rigid elloptical inclusion"
1973,Automating Workload Analysis of Large-Scale Supercomputer Systems,"AbstractThe architecture of modern supercomputers is extremely complex, so it is exceedingly difficult to monitor and maintain the efficiency of their functioning. And even if it is possible to collect the necessary data on the operation of all important supercomputer components, how not to drown in this ‘‘sea of information’’ and not miss the onset of a critical situation? This requires the automation of the workload analysis process. One of the possible solutions is to create a set of rules that automatically detect and notify supercomputer administrators about the occurrence of certain critical situations or cases of a significant decrease in the efficiency of supercomputer functioning. Such approach allows quickly identifying the most interesting and important situations for the administrator, as well as correctly prioritizing the workload analysis process in whole. This article describes the process of developing a set of 19 rules, each of which determines a way to detect the onset of a certain critical situation, provides a description of the possible causes of its occurrence, and also specifies the criticality of the situation that has arisen. These rules allow monitoring different aspects of supercomputer behavior: the efficiency of using application packages, the operation of the queue system, the load and availability of service servers, the presence of global performance issues in user applications, and the peculiarities of using separate partitions of the supercomputer. The developed rules formed the basis of the software solution that was implemented and evaluated on the Petaflop-level Lomonosov-2 supercomputer.","P. A. Shvets1,2, V. V. Voevodin1,2 & S. A.

The results show that for codimension 1 singularities, there are two generic singularity types for general solutions, and only one generic singularity type if there is a certain symmetry present. The analysis depends on a special choice of coordinates, which greatly simplifies the equations, showing that the type is exactly that of one dimensional Legendrian singularities, generalized so that the velocity can be infinite at the singularity. The solution is viewed as a surface in an appropriate compactified jet space. Smoothness of the solution surface is proved using the Cauchy-Kowalewski Theorem, which also shows that these singularity types are realizable. Numerical results from a special, highly accurate numerical method demonstrate the validity of this geometric analysis.

The high-fidelity model provides solution accuracy while the low-fidelity model reduces the computational cost.An outline of the theory of the Approximation Management Framework (AMF) proposed by Alexandrov (1996) and Lewis (1996) is given. The AMF algorithm provides the mathematical robustness required for variable-fidelity optimization.This paper introduces a subproblem formulation adapted to a modular implementation of the AMF. Also, we propose two types of second-order corrections (additive and multiplicative) which serve to build the approximation of the high-fidelity model based on the low-fidelity one.Results for a transonic airfoil shape optimization problem are presented. Application of a variable-fidelity algorithm leads to a threefold savings in high-fidelity solver calls, compared to a direct optimization using the high-fidelity solver only. However, premature stops of the algorithm are observed in some cases.A study of the influence of the numerical noise of solvers on robustness deficiency is presented. The study shows that numerical noise artificially introduced into an analytical function causes premature stops of the AMF.

Graphs of isogenies of degree a power of \(\ell \) are well-understood for elliptic curves, but not for higher-dimensional abelian varieties. We study the case of absolutely simple ordinary abelian varieties over a finite field. We analyse graphs of so-called \(\mathfrak l\)-isogenies, resolving that, in arbitrary dimension, their structure is similar, but not identical, to the “volcanoes” occurring as graphs of isogenies of elliptic curves. Specializing to the case of principally polarizable abelian surfaces, we then exploit this structure to describe graphs of a particular class of isogenies known as \((\ell , \ell )\)-isogenies: those whose kernels are maximal isotropic subgroups of the \(\ell \)-torsion for the Weil pairing. We use these two results to write an algorithm giving a path of computable isogenies from an arbitrary absolutely simple ordinary abelian surface towards one with maximal endomorphism ring, which has immediate consequences for the CM-method in genus 2, for computing explicit isogenies, and for the random self-reducibility of the discrete logarithm problem in genus 2 cryptography.","Ernest Hunter Brooks1, Dimitar Jetchev1 & Benjamin Wesolowski",Research in Number Theory,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40993-017-0087-5,"Isogeny graphs,

1983,History of the Lenz–Ising model 1965–1971: the role of a simple model in understanding critical phenomena,"This is the last in a series of three papers on the history of the Lenz–Ising model from 1920 to the early 1970s. In the first paper, I studied the invention of the model in the 1920s, while in the second paper, I documented a quite sudden change in the perception of the model in the early 1960s when it was realized that the Lenz–Ising model is actually relevant for the understanding of phase transitions. In this article, which is self-contained, I study how this realization affected attempts to understand critical phenomena, which can be understood as limiting cases of (first-order) phase transitions, in the epoch from circa 1965 to 1970, where these phenomena were recognized as a research field in its own right. I focus on two questions: What kinds of insight into critical phenomena was the employment of the Lenz–Ising model thought to give? And how could a crude model, which the Lenz–Ising model was thought to be, provide this understanding? I document that the model played several roles: At first, it played a role analogous to experimental data: hypotheses about real systems, in particular relations between critical exponents and what is now called the hypothesis of scaling, which was advanced by Benjamin Widom and others, were confronted with numerical results for the model, in particular the model’s so-called critical exponents. A positive result of a confrontation was seen as positive evidence for this hypothesis. The model was also used to gain insight into specific aspects of critical phenomena, for example that diverse physical systems exhibit similar behavior close to a critical point. Later, a more systematic program of understanding critical phenomena emerged that involved an explicit formulation of what it means to understand critical phenomena, namely, the elucidation of what features of the Hamiltonian of models lead to what kinds of behavior close to critical points. Attempts to accomplish this program culminated with the so-called hypothesis of universality, put forward independently by Robert B. Griffiths and Leo P. Kadanoff in 1970. They divided critical phenomena into classes with similar critical behavior. I also study the crucial role of the Lenz–Ising model in the development and justification of these ideas.",Martin Niss,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-011-0086-1,"Correlation Length,Ising Model,Critical Exponent,Physical Review,Critical Behavior"
1984,Good Local Behavior of Offsets to Implicit Algebraic Curves,"The notion of good local behavior of an offset curve was introduced in [2,4] to denote that the behavior of an offset was locally good from a topological point of view. Also, in these papers the problem of checking whether good local behavior holds for a particular offsetting distance, and of computing intervals of distances with this nice property, was addressed for the case of rational algebraic curves. Thus, here we generalize the results and techniques of these papers to the case when the curve to work with is an implicitly given, possibly singular, non-necessarily rational algebraic curve. Furthermore, a generalization of the (already known) results relating offsets and evolutes of regularly parametrized curves, is presented for the case of possibly singular, implicit algebraic curves.",Juan Gerardo Alcázar,Mathematics in Computer Science,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11786-008-0069-z,"Primary 14Q05,Secondary 68U07, 65D17"

For other left-invariant geometric structures, for example, complex, symplectic, or contact structures, there are difficult obstructions for their existence, which have still not been overcome, although a lot of works were devoted to them. In recent years, substantial progress in this direction has been made; in particular, classification theorems for low-dimensional groups have been obtained.

We compute phylogenetic invariants and estimates of the Euclidean distance functions for two sets of Germanic languages, a set of Romance languages, a set of Slavic languages and a set of early Indo-European languages, and we compare the results with what is known through historical linguistics.

We prove that the method converges to a solution, obtain existence and uniqueness of solutions to such equations with a small second order term and study the limiting behaviour of such solutions as this second order term tends to zero. The robustness of the algorithm will be discussed using numerical examples. These results will also be used to illustrate phenomena like propagation failure, which are encountered when studying lattice differential equations.

1988,Fitness Landscape Analysis and Metaheuristics Efficiency,"Landscape analysis has been identified as a promising way to develop efficient optimization methods. Nevertheless, the links between properties of the landscape and efficiency of methods is not easy to understand. In this article, we propose to give a contribution in this field using a vehicle routing problem as an illustration. Metaheuristics use a neighborhood operator that connects solutions of the search space. Thus, this operator acts on the dynamics of the search and impacts metaheuristics efficiency. Therefore, we characterize two landscapes differenciated by their neighborhood function and then, we analyze the performance of classical metaheuristics using one or the other neighborhood operator. Finally, a discussion provides insights on the relations between results of the landscape analysis and results of methods performance.","Marie-Éléonore Marmion1, Laetitia Jourdan1 & Clarisse Dhaenens",Journal of Mathematical Modelling and Algorithms in Operations Research,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10852-012-9177-5,"Landscape analysis,Operator efficiency,Routing problems"

In this paper, we make use of both the Lorentz conformal coordinates and the null coordinates, and their respective representation theorems of timelike minimal surfaces, to obtain a complete global classification of these surfaces and to characterize them using a geometric invariant called lightlike curvatures. As a result, we reveal the relationship between timelike Thomsen surfaces, and timelike minimal surfaces with planar curvature lines. As an application, we give a deformation of null curves preserving the pseudo-arclength parametrization and the constancy of the lightlike curvatures.","Shintaro Akamine1, Joseph Cho

1990,Generalized Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions: Spectral Analysis and Approximation of Almost Band-Limited Functions,"In this work, we first give various explicit and local estimates of the eigenfunctions of a perturbed Jacobi differential operator. These eigenfunctions generalize the famous classical prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWFs), founded in 1960s by Slepian and his co-authors and corresponding to the case \(\alpha =\beta =0.\) They also generalize the new PSWFs introduced and studied recently in Wang and Zhang (Appl Comput Harmon Anal 29:303–329, 2010), denoted by GPSWFs and corresponding to the case \(\alpha =\beta .\) The main content of this work is devoted to the previous interesting special case \(\alpha =\beta >- 1.\) In particular, we give further computational improvements, as well as some useful explicit and local estimates of the GPSWFs. More importantly, by using the concept of a restricted Paley–Wiener space, we relate the GPSWFs to the solutions of a generalized energy maximisation problem. As a consequence, many desirable spectral properties of the self-adjoint compact integral operator associated with the GPSWFs are deduced from the rich literature of the PSWFs. In particular, we show that the GPSWFs are well adapted for the spectral approximation of the classical c-band-limited as well as almost c-band-limited functions.

1991,Geometric Space–Frequency Analysis on Manifolds,"This paper gives a survey of methods for the construction of space–frequency concentrated frames on Riemannian manifolds with bounded curvature, and the applications of these frames to the analysis of function spaces. In this general context, the notion of frequency is defined using the spectrum of a distinguished differential operator on the manifold, typically the Laplace–Beltrami operator. Our exposition starts with the case of the real line, which serves as motivation and blueprint for the material in the subsequent sections. After the discussion of the real line, our presentation starts out in the most abstract setting proving rather general sampling-type results for appropriately defined Paley–Wiener vectors in Hilbert spaces. These results allow a handy construction of Paley–Wiener frames in \(L_2(\mathbf {M})\), for a Riemann manifold of bounded geometry, essentially by taking a partition of unity in frequency domain. The discretization of the associated integral kernels then gives rise to frames consisting of smooth functions in \(L_2(\mathbf {M})\), with fast decay in space and frequency. These frames are used to introduce new norms in corresponding Besov spaces on \(\mathbf {M}\). For compact Riemannian manifolds the theory extends to \(L_p\) and associated Besov spaces. Moreover, for compact homogeneous manifolds, one obtains the so-called product property for eigenfunctions of certain operators and proves cubature formulae with positive coefficients which allow to construct Parseval frames that characterize Besov spaces in terms of coefficient decay. The general theory is exemplified with the help of various concrete and relevant examples which include the unit sphere and the Poincaré half plane.","Hans G. Feichtinger1, Hartmut Führ2 & Isaac Z.

1992,Variational analysis of convexly generated spectral max functions,"The spectral abscissa is the largest real part of an eigenvalue of a matrix and the spectral radius is the largest modulus. Both are examples of spectral max functions—the maximum of a real-valued function over the spectrum of a matrix. These mappings arise in the control and stabilization of dynamical systems. In 2001, Burke and Overton characterized the regular subdifferential of the spectral abscissa and showed that the spectral abscissa is subdifferentially regular in the sense of Clarke when all active eigenvalues are nonderogatory. In this paper we develop new techniques to obtain these results for the more general class of convexly generated spectral max functions. In particular, we extend the Burke–Overton subdifferential regularity result to this class. These techniques allow us to obtain new variational results for the spectral radius.",James V.

1993,Comparative analysis on bifurcation of four-neuron fractional ring networks without or with leakage delays,"This paper is concerned with the problem of bifurcation for a ring fractional Hopfield neural network with leakage time delay and communication time delay. The stability and the Hopf bifurcations of such a network without and with time delays are investigated by analyzing the associated characteristic equations. Specifically, some criteria for the occurrence of Hopf bifurcations at the trivial steady state are established. It is shown that the dynamical property of the network is not only crucially dependent on the communication time delay, but also significantly influenced by the leakage time delay. Furthermore, the effects of the order on the Hopf bifurcation are numerically demonstrated. Finally, four numerical examples are provided to illustrate the feasibility of the theoretical results.","Zhouhong Li

1995,Spectral analysis of the integral operator arising from the beam deflection problem on elastic foundation II: eigenvalues,"We analyze the eigenstructure of the integral operator \(\mathcal{K}_{l, \alpha, k}\) which arise naturally from the beam deflection equation on linear elastic foundation with finite beam. We show that \(\mathcal{K}_{l, \alpha, k}\) has countably infinite number of positive eigenvalues approaching 0 as the limit, and give explicit upper and lower bounds on each of them. Consequently, we obtain explicit upper and lower bounds on the \(L^{2}\)-norm of the operator \(\mathcal{K}_{l, \alpha, k}\). We also present precise approximations of the eigenvalues as they approach the limit 0, which describes the almost regular structure of the spectrum of \(\mathcal{K}_{l, \alpha, k}\). Additionally, we analyze the dependence of the eigenvalues, including the \(L^{2}\)-norm of \(\mathcal{K}_{l, \alpha, k}\), on the intrinsic length \(L = 2 l \alpha\) of the beam, and show that each eigenvalue is continuous and strictly increasing with respect to L. In particular, we show that the respective limits of each eigenvalue as L goes to 0 and infinity are 0 and \(1/k\), where k is the linear spring constant of the given elastic foundation. Using Newton’s method, we also compute explicitly numerical values of the eigenvalues, including the \(L^{2}\)-norm of \(\mathcal{K}_{l, \alpha, k}\), corresponding to various values of L.",Sung Woo Choi,Boundary Value Problems,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13661-014-0268-2,"34L15,47G10,74K10"

In this paper, we present a new convergence analysis of a variable metric forward–backward splitting algorithm with extended relaxation parameters in real Hilbert spaces. We prove that this algorithm is weakly convergent when certain weak conditions are imposed upon the relaxation parameters. Consequently, we recover the forward–backward splitting algorithm with variable step sizes. As an application, we obtain a variable metric forward–backward splitting algorithm for solving the minimization problem of the sum of two convex functions, where one of them is differentiable with a Lipschitz continuous gradient. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of this algorithm to the fundamental of the variational inequalities problem, constrained convex minimization problem, and split feasibility problem. Numerical experimental results on LASSO problem in statistical learning demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed iterative algorithm.","Fuying Cui1, Yuchao Tang

1997,Why do Users Need to Take Care of Their HPC Applications Efficiency?,"AbstractHigh-performance computing takes a very important place in modern scientific research process. And since all scientists want to solve their problems faster, it is very important to speed up these computations. For these purposes, new algorithms are being developed, new HPC systems appear, etc. However, quite little attention is paid to the efficiency of high-performance computations, which often leads to a vast amount of supercomputer resources being idle. It is vital to change this situation; in particular, it is necessary to show users the importance and necessity of optimizing their applications. One of the main steps in this direction is to help users detect performance issues in their programs, analyze their level of criticality as well as root causes, and eliminate them in order to improve application performance. In this article we describe the research being performed at the Lomonosov Moscow State University aimed at solving this problem. In particular, we analyze the results of supercomputer center users survey, showing their opinion on the efficiency analysis. We also share our vision on the HPC center workflow requirements to support system and applications efficiency analysis. After that, we describe a software tool being developed that allows any supercomputer user to obtain and analyze versatile statistics on performance of his HPC jobs, helping him to detect possible root causes of performance degradation.","D.

The study of this paper reveals and exploits interesting connections between evolutionary game theory and random polynomial theory. The main contributions of the paper are some qualitative and quantitative results on the expected density, \(f_{n,d}\), and the expected number, E(n, d), of (stable) internal equilibria. Firstly, we show that in multi-player two-strategy games, they behave asymptotically as \(\sqrt{d-1}\) as d is sufficiently large. Secondly, we prove that they are monotone functions of d. We also make a conjecture for games with more than two strategies. Thirdly, we provide numerical simulations for our analytical results and to support the conjecture.

A new \(H^1\)-projection is defined for this problem for the first time to account for the mesh motion due to the moving interface. The well-posedness and optimal convergence properties in both the energy norm and \(L^2\) norm are analyzed for this mixed-type \(H^1\)-projection, with which the stability and optimal error estimate in the energy norm are derived for both semi- and fully discrete mixed finite element approximations to the Stokes/parabolic interface problem. Numerical experiments are carried out to validate all theoretical results. The developed analytical approach can be extended to a general FSI problem.

2003,Improved analysis of spectral algorithm for clustering,"Spectral algorithms are graph partitioning algorithms that partition a node set of a graph into groups by using a spectral embedding map. Clustering techniques based on the algorithms are referred to as spectral clustering and are widely used in data analysis. To gain a better understanding of why spectral clustering is successful, Peng et al. (In: Proceedings of the 28th conference on learning theory (COLT), vol 40, pp 1423–1455, 2015) and Kolev and Mehlhorn (In: 24th annual European symposium on algorithms (ESA 2016), vol 57, pp 57:1–57:14, 2016) studied the behavior of a certain type of spectral algorithm for a class of graphs, called well-clustered graphs. Specifically, they put an assumption on graphs and showed the performance guarantee of the spectral algorithm under it. The algorithm they studied used the spectral embedding map developed by Shi and Malik (IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell 22(8):888–905, 2000). In this paper, we improve on their results, giving a better performance guarantee under a weaker assumption. We also evaluate the performance of the spectral algorithm with the spectral embedding map developed by Ng et al. (In: Advances in neural information processing systems 14 (NIPS), pp 849–856, 2001).

We incorporate three delays with immune impairment into the virus infection model. We begin model analysis with proving the positivity and boundedness of the solutions, local stability of the infection-free and infected steady states, and uniform persistence of the system. By analyzing corresponding characteristic equation, the local stability of each feasible equilibria and the existence of Hopf bifurcation at the infected equilibrium are addressed, respectively. By fixing the immune delay as a bifurcation parameter, we get a limit cycle bifurcation about the infected steady state. Using center manifold argument and normal form theory, we derive explicit formulae to determine the stability and direction of the limit cycles of the model. By developing a few Lyapunov functionals, we obtain conditions ensuring global stability of steady states at \(\tau _3<\tau _3^*\).

2006,PDE-constrained optimization in medical image analysis,"PDE-constrained optimization problems find many applications in medical image analysis, for example, neuroimaging, cardiovascular imaging, and oncologic imaging. We review the related literature and give examples of the formulation, discretization, and numerical solution of PDE-constrained optimization problems for medical imaging. We discuss three examples. The first is image registration, the second is data assimilation for brain tumor patients, and the third is data assimilation in cardiovascular imaging. The image registration problem is a classical task in medical image analysis and seeks to find pointwise correspondences between two or more images. Data assimilation problems use a PDE-constrained formulation to link a biophysical model to patient-specific data obtained from medical images. The associated optimality systems turn out to be sets of nonlinear, multicomponent PDEs that are challenging to solve in an efficient way. The ultimate goal of our work is the design of inversion methods that integrate complementary data, and rigorously follow mathematical and physical principles, in an attempt to support clinical decision making. This requires reliable, high-fidelity algorithms with a short time-to-solution. This task is complicated by model and data uncertainties, and by the fact that PDE-constrained optimization problems are ill-posed in nature, and in general yield high-dimensional, severely ill-conditioned systems after discretization. These features make regularization, effective preconditioners, and iterative solvers that, in many cases, have to be implemented on distributed-memory architectures to be practical, a prerequisite. We showcase state-of-the-art techniques in scientific computing to tackle these challenges.","Andreas Mang1, Amir Gholami2, Christos Davatzikos3 & …George Biros",Optimization and Engineering,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-018-9390-9,"Optimal control,Medical imaging,PDE-constrained optimization,Memory-distributed algorithms"
2007,Analysis of a continuously stirred two tank reactor cascade with Haldane kinetics,"Biological reactors are employed in industrial applications to break down organic waste. We view the cascade of two open loop continuously stirred tank reactors with Haldane growth function as chemostats with bacterial inputs. A function of some of the reactor parameters is derived, the sign of which determines the maximum number of critical points a reactor can have. This allows us to determine the parameter combinations which ensure a reactor has only a single critical point for all bacterial removal rates (dilution rate plus death rate). Where a simple condition on the above function is confirmed to hold, if the first reactor in a cascade only has a single critical point for all bacterial removal rates then, the next reactor will also only have a single critical point for all bacterial removal rates. A global stability result is also given for some of these cases. A simple proof is given for the local stability of critical points of a reactor with a general class of bacterial growth functions, bacteria and substrate input, and a death rate. For the special case where the first reactor has zero bacteria input, we compare a two reactor cascade with a single reactor under various conditions, long and short residence times, and different death rates. This follows the pattern of similar papers that considered cascades using the Monod and Contois growth functions.","A. J. Stacey1 & J. J. Shepherd

Based on the homeomorphic mapping theorem, the quaternion matrix theorem and the Lyapunov theorem, some criteria are developed in the form of real-valued LMIs for guaranteeing the existence, uniqueness, and global robust stability of the equilibrium point of the delayed QVNNs. Two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.","Xiaofeng Chen

2010,Analysis of trophic networks: an optimisation approach,"We introduce a methodology to study the possible matter flows of an ecosystem defined by observational biomass data and realistic biological constraints. The flows belong to a polyhedron in a multi dimensional space that may make statistical exploration difficult in practice; instead, we propose to solve a convex optimization problem. Seven criteria based on ecological network indices have been selected to be used as convex goal functions. Numerical results show that the method is fast and can be used for large systems. Minimum flow solutions are analyzed using flow decomposition in paths and circuits. Their consistency is also tested by introducing a system of differential equations for the biomasses and examining the stability of the biomass fixed point. The method is illustrated and explained throughout the text on an ecosystem toy model. It is also applied to realistic food models.","Jean-Guy Caputo

2011,An analysis of Schwarz waveform relaxation domain decomposition methods for the imaginary-time linear Schrödinger and Gross-Pitaevskii equations,"The aim of this paper is to derive and numerically validate some asymptotic estimates of the convergence rate of Classical and quasi-Optimal Schwarz Waveform Relaxation (SWR) domain decomposition methods applied to the computation of the stationary states of the one-dimensional linear and nonlinear Schrödinger equations with a space-dependent potential. Although SWR methods are currently used for efficiently solving high dimensional partial differential equations, their convergence analysis and most particularly obtaining expressions of their convergence rate remains largely open even in one dimension, except in simple cases. In this work, we tackle this problem for linear and nonlinear one-dimensional Schrödinger equations by developing techniques which can be extended to higher dimensional problems and other types of PDEs. The approach combines the method developed in Gander and Halpern (SIAM J Num Anal 45(2):666–697, 2007) for the linear advection reaction diffusion equation and the theory of inhomogeneous pseudodifferential operators in conjunction with the associated symbolic asymptotic expansions. For computing the stationary states, we consider the imaginary-time formulation of the Schrödinger equation based on the Normalized Gradient Flow (NGF) method and use a semi-implicit Euler scheme for the discretization. Some numerical results in the one-dimensional case illustrate the analysis for both the linear Schrödinger and Gross-Pitaevskii equations.","X. Antoine1,2 & E.

2012,"Adelic Multiresolution Analysis, Construction of Wavelet Bases and Pseudo-Differential Operators","In our previous paper, the Haar multiresolution analysis (MRA) \(\{V_{j}\}_{j\in \mathbb {Z}}\) in \(L^{2}(\mathbb {A})\) was constructed, where \(\mathbb {A}\) is the adele ring. Since \(L^{2}(\mathbb {A})\) is the infinite tensor product of the spaces \(L^{2}({\mathbb {Q}}_{p})\), p=∞,2,3,…, the adelic MRA has some specific properties different from the corresponding finite-dimensional ones. Nevertheless, this infinite-dimensional MRA inherits almost all basic properties of the finite-dimensional case. In this paper we derive explicit formulas for bases in V

, \(j\in \mathbb {Z}\), and for the wavelet bases generated by the above-mentioned adelic MRA. In view of the specific properties of the adelic MRA, there arise some technical problems in the construction of wavelet bases. These problems were solved with the aid of the operator formalization of the process of generation of wavelet bases. We study the spectral properties of the fractional operator introduced by S. Torba and W.A. Zúñiga-Galindo. We prove that the constructed wavelet functions are eigenfunctions of this fractional operator. This paper, as well as our previous paper, introduces new ideas to construct different infinite-dimensional MRAs. Our results can be used in the theory of adelic pseudo-differential operators and equations over the ring of adeles and in adelic models in physics.","A. Y. Khrennikov1, V. M.

2013,Cartan uniqueness theorem on nonopen sets,"Cartan’s uniqueness theorem does not hold in general for CR mappings, but it does hold under certain conditions guaranteeing extendibility of CR functions to a fixed neighborhood. These conditions can be defined naturally for a wide class of sets such as local real-analytic subvarieties or subanalytic sets, not just submanifolds. Suppose that V is a locally connected and locally closed subset of \({\mathbb {C}}^n\) such that the hull constructed by contracting analytic discs close to arbitrarily small neighborhoods of a point always contains the point in the interior. Then, restrictions of holomorphic functions uniquely extend to a fixed neighborhood of the point. Using this extension, we obtain a version of Cartan’s uniqueness theorem for such sets. When V is a real-analytic subvariety, we can generalize the concept of infinitesimal CR automorphism and also prove an analogue of the theorem. As an application of these two results we show that, for circular subvarieties, the only automorphisms, CR or infinitesimal, are linear.","Jiří Lebl

2014,A Bounded Data Envelopment Analysis Model in a Fuzzy Environment with an Application to Safety in the Semiconductor Industry,"Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a mathematical programming approach for evaluating the relative efficiency of decision making units (DMUs) in organizations. The conventional DEA methods require accurate measurement of both the inputs and outputs. However, the observed values of the input and output data in real-world problems are often imprecise or vague. Fuzzy set theory is widely used to quantify imprecise and vague data in DEA models. In this paper, we propose a four-step bounded fuzzy DEA model, where the inputs and outputs are assumed to be fuzzy numbers. In the first step, we create a hypothetical fuzzy anti-ideal DMU and calculate its best fuzzy relative efficiency. In the second step, we propose a pair of fuzzy DEA models to obtain the upper- and the lower-bounds of the fuzzy efficiency, where the lower-bound is at least equal to the fuzzy efficiency of the anti-ideal DMU, and the upper-bound is at most equal to one. In step three, we use multi-objective programming to solve the proposed fuzzy programs. In the fourth step, we propose a new method for ranking the bounded fuzzy efficiency scores. We also present a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and the efficacy of the procedures and algorithms in measuring the safety performance of eight semiconductor facilities.","Adel Hatami-Marbini1, Madjid Tavana2,3, Kobra Gholami4 & …Zahra Ghelej Beigi",Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-014-0559-x,"Data envelopment analysis,Fuzzy data,Interval efficiency,Safety,Semiconductor industry"

We analyze relations between syntactic parameters in terms of dimensionality, of hierarchical clustering structures, and of non-trivial loops. We show there are relations that hold across language families and additional relations that are family-specific. We then analyze the trees describing the merging structure of persistent connected components for languages in different language families and we show that they partly correlate to historical phylogenetic trees but with significant differences. We also show the existence of interesting non-trivial persistent first homology groups in various language families. We give examples where explicit generators for the persistent first homology can be identified, some of which appear to correspond to homoplasy phenomena, while others may have an explanation in terms of historical linguistics, corresponding to known cases of syntactic borrowing across different language subfamilies.

We employ real statistical data of dengue infection cases of East Java, Indonesia, from 2018 and parameterize the dengue model. The estimated basic reduction number for this dataset is \(\mathcal{R}_{0}\approx2.2020\). We briefly show the stability results of the model for the case when the basic reproduction number is \(\mathcal{R}_{0} <1\). We apply the fractal-fractional operator in the framework of Caputo–Fabrizio to the model and present its numerical solution by using a novel approach. The parameter values estimated for the model are used to compare with fractal-fractional operator, and we suggest that the fractal-fractional operator provides the best fitting for real cases of dengue infection when varying the values of both operators’ orders. We suggest some more graphical illustration for the model variables with various orders of fractal and fractional."," Fatmawati1, Muhammad Altaf Khan

2023,Modeling and bifurcation analysis of a viral infection with time delay and immune impairment,"The rich dynamics of a viral infection model is studied under the assumption that the immune response is proposed based on some important biological meanings. In this paper, we study the dynamical behaviour of delayed viral infection with immune impairment model, viewing the infection rate of HIV-1 infection as a saturated function of the viral load, to formulate HIV-1 model dynamics. We explicitly link the individual and the viral population scale, and derive the basic reproduction number \(R_0\) for the coupled system. The effect of time delay on stability and Hopf bifurcation for the infected equilibrium have been studied. By fixing the immune delay as a bifurcation parameter, we get a limit cycle bifurcation about the infected steady state. Using center manifold argument and normal form theory, we derive explicit formulae to determine the stability and direction of the limit cycles of the model. To analyze the model and perform a detailed global dynamics analysis, two Lyapunov functionals are constructed to prove the global asymptotical stability of the disease-free and infected equilibria. Theoretical results indicate that \(R_0\) provides a threshold value determining whether or not the disease dies out. Numerical simulations are carried out to explain the mathematical conclusions.",P. Krishnapriya1 & M.

2036,On the interconnection between the higher-order singular values of real tensors ,"A higher-order tensor allows several possible matricizations (reshapes into matrices). The simultaneous decay of singular values of such matricizations has crucial implications on the low-rank approximability of the tensor via higher-order singular value decomposition. It is therefore an interesting question which simultaneous properties the singular values of different tensor matricizations actually can have, but it has not received the deserved attention so far. In this paper, preliminary investigations in this direction are conducted. While it is clear that the singular values in different matricizations cannot be prescribed completely independent from each other, numerical experiments suggest that sufficiently small, but otherwise arbitrary perturbations preserve feasibility. An alternating projection heuristic is proposed for constructing tensors with prescribed singular values (assuming their feasibility). Regarding the related problem of characterising sets of tensors having the same singular values in specified matricizations, it is noted that orthogonal equivalence under multilinear matrix multiplication is a sufficient condition for two tensors to have the same singular values in all principal, Tucker-type matricizations, but, in contrast to the matrix case, not necessary.

2038,Orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle: Verblunsky coefficients with some restrictions imposed on a pair of related real sequences,"It was shown recently that associated with a pair of real sequences \(\{\{c_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty }, \{d_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty }\}\), with \(\{d_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty }\) a positive chain sequence, there exists a unique nontrivial probability measure \(\mu \) on the unit circle. The Verblunsky coefficients \(\{\alpha _{n}\}_{n=0}^{\infty }\) associated with the orthogonal polynomials with respect to \(\mu \) are given by the relation $$\begin{aligned} \alpha _{n-1}=\overline{\tau }_{n-1}\left[ \frac{1-2m_{n}-ic_{n}}{1-ic_{n}}\right] , \quad n \ge 1, \end{aligned}$$where \(\tau _0 = 1\), \(\tau _{n}=\prod _{k=1}^{n}(1-ic_{k})/(1+ic_{k})\), \(n \ge 1\) and \(\{m_{n}\}_{n=0}^{\infty }\) is the minimal parameter sequence of \(\{d_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty }\). In this manuscript, we consider this relation and its consequences by imposing some restrictions of sign and periodicity on the sequences \(\{c_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty }\) and \(\{m_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty }\). When the sequence \( \{c_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty }\) is of alternating sign, we use information about the zeros of associated para-orthogonal polynomials to show that there is a gap in the support of the measure in the neighbourhood of \(z= -1\). Furthermore, we show that it is possible to generate periodic Verblunsky coefficients by choosing periodic sequences \(\{c_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty }\) and \(\{m_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty }\) with the additional restriction \(c_{2n}=-c_{2n-1}, \, n\ge 1.\) We also give some results on periodic Verblunsky coefficients from the point of view of positive chain sequences. An example is provided to illustrate the results obtained.","Cleonice F. Bracciali1, Jairo S. Silva2, A. Sri Ranga1 & …Daniel O.

2039,"On a class of Gauss-like quadrature rules
","We consider a problem that arises in the evaluation of computer graphics
illumination models.  In particular, there is a need to find a finite
set of wavelengths at which the illumination model should be evaluated.
The result of evaluating the illumination model at these points is a
sampled representation of the spectral power density of light emanating
from a point in the scene.  These values are then used to determine the
RGB coordinates of the light by evaluating three definite integrals,
each with a common integrand (the SPD) and interval of integration but
with distinct weight functions.  We develop a method for selecting the
sample wavelengths in an optimal manner.

More abstractly, we examine the problem of numerically evaluating a set
of \(m\) definite integrals taken with respect to
distinct weight
functions but related by a common integrand and interval of integration.
It is shown that when \(m \geq 3\) it is not efficient
to use a set of \(m\)
Gauss rules because valuable information is wasted.  We go on to extend
the notions used in Gaussian quadrature to find an optimal set of
shared abcissas that maximize precision in a well-defined sense.
The classical Gauss rules come out as the special case\(m=1\)
 and some
analysis is given concerning the existence of these rules when\(m >1\)
. In particular, we give conditions on the
weight functions that are
sufficient to guarantee that the shared abcissas are real, distinct, and
lie in the interval of integration.  Finally, we examine some
computational strategies for constructing these rules.

If \(\mathcal {A}\) is the set of affine spans of the facets of a convex polytope \(\mathcal {P}\) and \(p\) lies in the interior of \(\mathcal {P}\), then the valid orderings with respect to \(p\) are just the line shellings of \(\mathcal {P}\) where the shelling line contains \(p\). When \(p\) is sufficiently generic, the intersection lattice of \(\mathrm {vo}(\mathcal {A},p)\) is the Dilworth truncation of the semicone of \(\mathcal {A}\). Various applications and examples are given. For instance, we determine the maximum number of line shellings of a \(d\)-polytope with \(m\) facets when the shelling line contains a fixed point \(p\). If \(\mathcal {P}\) is the order polytope of a poset, then the sets of facets visible from a point involve a generalization of chromatic polynomials related to list colorings.",Richard P.

The validation  case study involved the collection of real-world data by means of a questionnaire to perform a network design construction and analysis. The key idea is to examine social network to  help in the identification of  behaviors and interests of people for better software requirements elicitation.ResultsThe validation case study demonstrates how unexpected centrality measures can emerge in real world networks. Our case study can thus conducted as a baseline for better requirement elicitation studies for online social network software design. This work also indicates how sociometric methods may be used to analyze any social domain as a possible standard practice in online social network software design. Overall, the study proved the effectiveness of the proposed novel methodology for the design of online social network software.  The methodology specifically improves upon traditional methods for software design by involving social network modeling and analysis to first study the behavior and elicit requirements to develop more resilient online social network sites.",Faiza Ghafoor1 & Muaz A.

2052,An algorithm for the rapid numerical evaluation of Bessel functions of real orders and arguments,"We describe a method for the rapid numerical evaluation of the Bessel functions of the first and second kinds of nonnegative real orders and positive arguments. Our algorithm makes use of the well-known observation that although the Bessel functions themselves are expensive to represent via piecewise polynomial expansions, the logarithms of certain solutions of Bessel’s equation are not. We exploit this observation by numerically precomputing the logarithms of carefully chosen Bessel functions and representing them with piecewise bivariate Chebyshev expansions. Our scheme is able to evaluate Bessel functions of orders between 0 and 1,000,000,000 at essentially any positive real argument. In that regime, it is competitive with existing methods for the rapid evaluation of Bessel functions and has at least three advantages over them. First, our approach is quite general and can be readily applied to many other special functions which satisfy second order ordinary differential equations. Second, by calculating the logarithms of the Bessel functions rather than the Bessel functions themselves, we avoid many issues which arise from numerical overflow and underflow. Third, in the oscillatory regime, our algorithm calculates the values of a nonoscillatory phase function for Bessel’s differential equation and its derivative. These quantities are useful for computing the zeros of Bessel functions, as well as for rapidly applying the Fourier-Bessel transform. The results of extensive numerical experiments demonstrating the efficacy of our algorithm are presented. A Fortran package which includes our code for evaluating the Bessel functions is publicly available.",James Bremer,Advances in Computational Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-018-9613-9,"Special functions,Fast algorithms,Nonoscillatory phase functions"
2053,The Limiting Spectral Measure for Ensembles of Symmetric Block Circulant Matrices,"Given an ensemble of N×N random matrices, a natural question to ask is whether or not the empirical spectral measures of typical matrices converge to a limiting spectral measure as N→∞. While this has been proved for many thin patterned ensembles sitting inside all real symmetric matrices, frequently there is no nice closed form expression for the limiting measure. Further, current theorems provide few pictures of transitions between ensembles. We consider the ensemble of symmetric m-block circulant matrices with entries i.i.d.r.v. These matrices have toroidal diagonals periodic of period m. We view m as a “dial” we can “turn” from the thin ensemble of symmetric circulant matrices, whose limiting eigenvalue density is a Gaussian, to all real symmetric matrices, whose limiting eigenvalue density is a semi-circle. The limiting eigenvalue densities f

m
 show a visually stunning convergence to the semi-circle as m→∞, which we prove.In contrast to most studies of patterned matrix ensembles, our paper gives explicit closed form expressions for the densities. We prove that f

m
 is the product of a Gaussian and a certain even polynomial of degree 2m−2; the formula is the same as that for the m×m Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). The proof is by derivation of the moments from the eigenvalue trace formula. The new feature, which allows us to obtain closed form expressions, is converting the central combinatorial problem in the moment calculation into an equivalent counting problem in algebraic topology. We end with a generalization of the m-block circulant pattern, dropping the assumption that the m random variables be distinct. We prove that the limiting spectral distribution exists and is determined by the pattern of the independent elements within an m-period, depending not only on the frequency at which each element appears, but also on the way the elements are arranged.","Murat Koloğlu1, Gene S.

We also study mean values for the class number and for the cardinality of the second K-group of maximal order of the associated fields for ramified imaginary, real, and inert imaginary quadratic function fields over \(\mathbb {F}_{q}\). One of the main novelties of this paper is that we compute the second moment of quadratic Dirichlet L-functions associated to monic irreducible polynomials. It is worth noting that the similar second moment over number fields is unknown. The second innovation of this paper comes from the fact that, if the cardinality of the ground field is even then the task of average L-functions in function fields is much harder and, in this paper, we are able to handle this strenuous case and establish several mean values results of L-functions over function fields.","Julio C.

2070,"On the formulation and analysis of general deterministic structured population models
II. Nonlinear theory"," This paper is as much about a certain modelling methodology, as it is about the constructive definition of future population states from a description of individual behaviour and an initial population state. The key idea is to build a nonlinear model in two steps, by explicitly introducing the environmental condition via the requirement that individuals are independent from one another (and hence equations are linear) when this condition is prescribed as a function of time.A linear physiologically structured population model is defined by two rules, one for reproduction and one for development and survival, both depending on the initial individual state and the prevailing environmental condition. In Part I we showed how one can constructively define future population state operators from these two ingredients.A nonlinear model is a linear model together with a feedback law that describes how the environmental condition at any particular time depends on the population size and composition at that time. When applied to the solution of the linear problem, the feedback law yields a fixed point problem. This we solve constructively by means of the contraction mapping principle, for any given initial population state. Using subsequently this fixed point as input in the linear population model, we obtain a population semiflow. We then say that we solved the nonlinear problem.For models formulated as first order partial differential equations with nonlocal boundary conditions our approach amounts to deriving an integral equation by integrating along characteristics. This integral equation is then solved by a successive approximation procedure. By formalizing the biological ingredients directly as integral kernels and using these to construct the semigroup of population state transition operators we (a) can do with rather minimal regularity conditions on the coefficients (i.e., on individual behaviour), (b) do not have to worry about regularity properties of solutions to guarantee that we really have constructed a solution of a pde.The paper is organized in a top-down spirit: We describe a general abstract setting first and then specialise, while becoming more technical.The results are not restricted to a single population but also cover the interaction (including predation) of several structured (and unstructured) populations.","O.

2071,The Sperner Capacity of Linear and Nonlinear Codes for the Cyclic Triangle,"Shannon introduced the concept of zero-error capacity of a discrete memoryless channel. The channel determines an undirected graph on the symbol alphabet, where adjacency means that symbols cannot be confused at the receiver. The zero-error or Shannon capacity is an invariant of this graph. Gargano, Körner, and Vaccaro have recently extended the concept of Shannon capacity to directed graphs. Their generalization of Shannon capacity is called Sperner capacity. We resolve a problem posed by these authors by giving the first example (the two orientations of the triangle) of a graph where the Sperner capacity depends on the orientations of the edges.Sperner capacity seems to be achieved by nonlinear codes, whereas Shannon capacity seems to be attainable by linear codes. In particular, linear codes do not achieve Sperner capacity for the cyclic triangle. We use Fourier analysis or linear programming to obtain the best upper bounds for linear codes. The bounds for unrestricted codes are obtained from rank arguments, eigenvalue interlacing inequalities and polynomial algebra.The statement of the cyclic q-gon problem is very simple: what is the maximum size N

The paper lays the foundations of the theory of discrete event systems with mixed constraints. We introduce min-max functions,F:R

Among other results, we give a complete account of the periodic behavior of functions of dimension 2; we introduce and characterize the concept of balance which generalizes irreducibility in the linear theory; and we give a formula for the cycle time (eigenvalue) of a min-max function which generalizes the maximum cycle mean formula.",Jeremy Gunawardena1 nAff,Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,1994,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01440235,"cycle time,discrete event system,dynamical system, eigenvalue,fixed point,max-plus algebra,min-max function"

At the same time, the molecular dynamics method based on solving the equations of motion for a multiparticle system proved to be directly related to the basic concepts of classical statistical physics, in particular, to the problem of the occurrence of irreversibility. This paper analyzes the dynamic and stochastic properties of molecular dynamics systems connected with the local instability of trajectories and the errors of the numerical integration.

Under certain regularity conditions this study is equivalent to investigating the solution of a set of couple diffusion equations, generalization of the Fokker-Planck (or second Kolmogorov) equation. Assuming the process homogeneous inx, but in general time-inhomogeneous, this set of equations is studied with the help of the Fourier transformation. The marginal distribution in then discrete states corresponds to a time-inhomogeneousn-state Markov chain in continuous time. The properties of such a Markov chain are studied, especially the asymptotic behaviour in the time-periodic case. We obtain a natural generalization of the well-known asymptotic behaviour in the time-homogeneous case, finding a subdivision of the states into groups of essential states, the distribution inside easch group being asymptotically periodic and independent of the starting distribution. Next, still assuming time-periodicity, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the complete Markovian process, showing that inside each of the groups mentioned above the distribution approaches a common normal distribution inx-space, with mean value and variance proportional tot.

The space of unit Killing vector fields on \((S^{2k+1}, g_\mathrm{can})\) from Lie algebra \(\mathfrak g \) of Lie group \(G\) is described as some symmetric space (except the case \(G=U(k+1)\) when one obtains the union of all complex Grassmannians in \(\mathbb{C }^{k+1}\)).",Valeriĭ Nikolaevich Berestovskiĭ1 & Yuriĭ Gennadievich Nikonorov,Annals of Global Analysis and Geometry,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10455-013-9393-x,"Clifford algebras,Clifford–Wolf homogeneous spaces ,Generalized normal homogeneous Riemannian manifolds,g.o. spaces,Grassmannian algebra,Homogeneous spaces,Hopf fibrations,Normal homogeneous Riemannian manifolds,Generalized normal homogeneous but not normal homogeneous,Riemannian submersions,(weakly) symmetric spaces"
2089,Stability of Viscous St. Venant Roll Waves: From Onset to Infinite Froude Number Limit,"We study the spectral stability of roll wave solutions of the viscous St. Venant equations modeling inclined shallow water flow, both at onset in the small Froude number or “weakly unstable” limit \(F\rightarrow 2^+\) and for general values of the Froude number F, including the limit \(F\rightarrow +\infty \). In the former, \(F\rightarrow 2^+\), limit, the shallow water equations are formally approximated by a Korteweg-de Vries/Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (KdV–KS) equation that is a singular perturbation of the standard Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation modeling horizontal shallow water flow. Our main analytical result is to rigorously validate this formal limit, showing that stability as \(F\rightarrow 2^+\) is equivalent to stability of the corresponding KdV–KS waves in the KdV limit. Together with recent results obtained for KdV–KS by Johnson–Noble–Rodrigues–Zumbrun and Barker, this gives not only the first rigorous verification of stability for any single viscous St. Venant roll wave, but a complete classification of stability in the weakly unstable limit. In the remainder of the paper, we investigate numerically and analytically the evolution of the stability diagram as Froude number increases to infinity. Notably, we find transition at around \(F=2.3\) from weakly unstable to different, large-F behavior, with stability determined by simple power-law relations. The latter stability criteria are potentially useful in hydraulic engineering applications, for which typically \(2.5\le F\le 6.0\).","Blake Barker1, Mathew A. Johnson2, Pascal Noble3, L.

2090,Pattern Formation in a Three-Species Cyclic Competition Model,"In nature, different species compete among themselves for common resources and favorable habitat. Therefore, it becomes really important to determine the key factors in maintaining the bio-diversity. Also, some competing species follow cyclic competition in real world where the competitive dominance is characterized by a cyclic ordering. In this paper, we study the formation of a wide variety of spatiotemporal patterns including stationary, periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic population distributions for a diffusive Lotka–Volterra type three-species cyclic competition model with two different types of cyclic ordering. For both types of cyclic ordering, the temporal dynamics of the corresponding non-spatial system show the extinction of two species through global bifurcations such as homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations. For the spatial system, we show that the existence of Turing patterns is possible for a particular cyclic ordering, while it is not the case for the other cyclic ordering through both the analytical and numerical methods. Further, we illustrate an interesting scenario of short-range invasion as opposed to the usual invasion phenomenon over the entire habitat. Also, our study reveals that both the stationary and dynamic population distributions can coexist in different parts of a habitat. Finally, we extend the spatial system by incorporating nonlocal intra-specific competition terms for all the three competing species. Our study shows that the introduction of nonlocality in intra-specific competitions stabilizes the system dynamics by transforming a dynamic population distribution to stationary. Surprisingly, this nonlocality-induced stationary pattern formation leads to the extinction of one species and hence, gives rise to the loss of bio-diversity for intermediate ranges of nonlocality. However, the bio-diversity can be restored for sufficiently large extent of nonlocality.","Kalyan Manna1, Vitaly Volpert2,3,4 & Malay Banerjee

2094,Structure and Rigidity in (Gromov) Hyperbolic Groups and Discrete Groups in Rank 1 Lie Groups II," We borrow the Jaco-Shalen-Johannson notion of characteristic sub-manifold from 3-dimensional topology to study cyclic splittings of torsion-free (Gromov) hyperbolic groups and finitely generated discrete groups in rank 1 Lie groups. Our JSJ canonical decomposition is a fundamental object for studying the dynamics of individual automorphisms and the automorphism group of a torsion-free hyperbolic group and a key tool in our approach to the isomorphism problem for these groups [S3]. For discrete groups in rank 1 Lie groups, the JSJ canonical decomposition serves as a basic object for understanding the geometry of the space of discrete faithful representations and allows a natural generalization of the Teichmüller modular group and the Riemann moduli space for these discrete groups.

2095,A penalized method of alternating projections for weighted low-rank hankel matrix optimization,"Weighted low-rank Hankel matrix optimization has long been used to reconstruct contaminated signal or forecast missing values for time series of a wide class. The Method of Alternating Projections (MAP) (i.e., alternatively projecting to a low-rank matrix manifold and the Hankel matrix subspace) is a leading method. Despite its wide use, MAP has long been criticized of lacking convergence and of ignoring the weights used to reflect importance of the observed data. The most of known results are in a local sense. In particular, the latest research shows that MAP may converge at a linear rate provided that the initial point is close enough to a true solution and a transversality condition is satisfied. In this paper, we propose a globalized variant of MAP through a penalty approach. The proposed method inherits the favourable local properties of MAP and has the same computational complexity. Moreover, it is capable of handling a general weight matrix, is globally convergent, and enjoys local linear convergence rate provided that the cutting off singular values are significantly smaller than the kept ones. Furthermore, the new method also applies to complex data. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method against several popular variants of MAP.","Jian Shen1, Jein-Shan Chen2, Hou-Duo Qi1 & …Naihua Xiu",Mathematical Programming Computation,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12532-022-00217-1,"Hankel matrix,Alternating projections,Global convergence,Linear convergence,Time series"

Based on this qualitative description, we construct a fourth order method which efficiently computes the complex zeros of solutions of second order ODEs following the path of the approximate anti-Stokes lines. We illustrate the method with the computation of the zeros of parabolic cylinder functions, Bessel functions and generalized Bessel polynomials and describe specific algorithms for the computation of these zeros.",Javier Segura,Numerische Mathematik,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-013-0528-6,"33F05,65H05,34M10,34C10,30E99"

2098,Dual curves and pseudoholomorphic curves," A notion of dual curve for pseudoholomorphic curves in 4-manifolds turns out to be possible only if the notion of almost complex structure structure is slightly generalized. The resulting structure is as easy (perhaps easier) to work with, and yields many analogues of results in complex surface theory, using a description of the local geometry via Cartan's method of equivalence. Duality then uncovers a new infinite-dimensional family of geometric integrable systems. These are the first steps toward geometry on moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves.

We show that they are the same with equivalent norms and, furthermore, that they are identified with the weighted Fock space \(F^{p}_{\alpha -sp,0}\) for the full range of parameters. So, the study on the weighted Fock-Sobolev spaces is reduced to that on the weighted Fock spaces. We describe explicitly the reproducing kernels for the weighted Fock spaces and then establish the boundedness of integral operators induced by the reproducing kernels. We also identify dual spaces, obtain complex interpolation result and characterize Carleson measures.","Hong Rae Cho1, Boo Rim Choe2 & Hyungwoon Koo",Potential Analysis,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11118-015-9468-3,"Fock-Sobolev space of fractional order,Weighted Fock space,Carleson measure,Banach dual,Complex interpolation"

We provide asymptotic formulas for the Bergman projector and Berezin–Toeplitz operators on a compact Kähler manifold. These objects depend on an integer N and we study, in the limit \(N\rightarrow +\infty \), situations in which one can control them up to an error \(O(e^{-cN})\) for some \(c>0\). We develop a calculus of Toeplitz operators with real-analytic symbols, which applies to Kähler manifolds with real-analytic metrics. In particular, we prove that the Bergman kernel is controlled up to \(O(e^{-cN})\) on any real-analytic Kähler manifold as \(N\rightarrow +\infty \). We also prove that Toeplitz operators with analytic symbols can be composed and inverted up to \(O(e^{-cN})\). As an application, we study eigenfunction concentration for Toeplitz operators if both the manifold and the symbol are real-analytic. In this case we prove exponential decay in the classically forbidden region.","Alix Deleporte1,",The Journal of Geometric Analysis,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12220-020-00419-w,"Bergman kernel,Szegö kernel,Analytic fourier integral operator,Kähler manifold,Berezin–Toeplitz operators"
2105,Multiple Equilibria in a Non-smooth Epidemic Model with Medical-Resource Constraints,"The issue of medical-resource constraints has the potential to dramatically affect disease management, especially in developing countries. We analyze a non-smooth epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate and resource constraints, which defines a vaccination program with vaccination rate proportional to the number of susceptible individuals when this number is below the threshold level and constant otherwise. To better understand the impact of this non-smooth vaccination policy, we provide a comprehensive qualitative analysis of global dynamics for the whole parameter space. As the threshold value varies, the target model admits multistability of three regular equilibria, bistability of two regular equilibria, that of one disease-free equilibrium and one generalized endemic equilibria, and that of one disease-free equilibrium and one crossing cycle. The steady-state regimes include healthy, low epidemic and high epidemic. This suggests the key role of the threshold value, as well as the initial infection condition in disease control. Our findings demonstrate that the case number can be contained at a satisfactorily controllable level or range if eradicating it proves to be impossible.","Aili Wang1, Yanni Xiao2 & Robert Smith

Theoretical analysis of such a parallel branch and bound algorithm is very hard and empirical analysis is not straightforward because the performance of a parallel algorithm cannot be evaluated simply by executing the algorithm on a few parallel systems. Among the difficulties encountered are the noise produced by other users on the system, the limited variation in parallelism (the number of processors in the system is strictly bounded) and the waste of resources involved: most of the time, the outcomes of all computations are already known and the only issue of interest is when these outcomes are produced.We will describe a way to simulate the execution of parallel branch and bound algorithms on arbitrary parallel systems in such a way that the memory and cpu requirements are very reasonable. The use of simulation has only minor consequences for the formulation of the algorithm.","Arie de Bruin1, Alexander H. G. Rinnooy Kan1 & Harry W. J. M.

Based on the possibility theory, a computational procedure for the reliability analysis of fuzzy failure problems and random-fuzzy failure problems of mechanical structures that contain fuzzy variables were presented.

The failure possibility of fuzzy structures and possibility distribution of the probability of failure of fuzzy-random structures can be given by the proposed methods. It is shown that for the hybrid probabilistic and fuzzy reliability problems, the probability of failure should be suitably taken as a fuzzy variable in order to indicate the real safety of system objectively.

Random matrices play the role of free random variables in this context so the method we develop, which we call free component analysis (FCA), unmixes matrices from additive mixtures of matrices. Thus, while the mixing model is standard, the novelty and difference in unmixing performance comes from the introduction of a new statistical criteria, derived from free probability theory, that quantify freeness analogous to how kurtosis and entropy quantify independence. We describe the theory, the various algorithms, and compare FCA to vanilla ICA which does not account for spatial or temporal structure. We highlight why the statistical criteria make FCA also vanilla despite its matricial underpinnings and show that FCA performs comparably to, and sometimes better than, (vanilla) ICA in every application, such as image and speech unmixing, where ICA has been known to succeed. Our computational experiments suggest that not-so-random matrices, such as images and short-time Fourier transform matrix of waveforms are (closer to being) freer “in the wild” than we might have theoretically expected.",Raj Rao Nadakuditi1 & Hao Wu,Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-022-09564-w,"Independent component analysis,Free probability,Random matrices,Blind source separation"

This logic does not e.g. allow the definition and study of mathematicians’ uniformity concepts important in analysis. Mathematicians’ stronger logic was rediscovered around 1990 as the form of independence-friendly logic which hence is not a new logic nor a further development of ordinary first-order logic but a richer version of it.",Jaakko Hintikka,Logica Universalis,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11787-012-0065-6,"03,01"
2125,Analysis of symmetries in models of multi-strain infections,"In mathematical studies of the dynamics of multi-strain diseases caused by antigenically diverse pathogens, there is a substantial interest in analytical insights. Using the example of a generic model of multi-strain diseases with cross-immunity between strains, we show that a significant understanding of the stability of steady states and possible dynamical behaviours can be achieved when the symmetry of interactions between strains is taken into account. Techniques of equivariant bifurcation theory allow one to identify the type of possible symmetry-breaking Hopf bifurcation, as well as to classify different periodic solutions in terms of their spatial and temporal symmetries. The approach is also illustrated on other models of multi-strain diseases, where the same methodology provides a systematic understanding of bifurcation scenarios and periodic behaviours. The results of the analysis are quite generic, and have wider implications for understanding the dynamics of a large class of models of multi-strain diseases.",Konstantin B.

2126,Virus antibody dynamics in primary and secondary dengue infections,"Dengue viral infections show unique infection patterns arising from its four serotypes, (DENV-1,2,3,4). Its effects range from simple fever in primary infections to potentially fatal secondary infections. We analytically and numerically analyse virus dynamics and humoral response in a host during primary and secondary dengue infection for long periods using micro-epidemic models. The models presented here incorporate time delays, antibody dependent enhancement, a dynamic switch and a correlation factor between different DENV serotypes. We find that the viral load goes down to undetectable levels within 7–14 days as is observed for dengue infection, in both cases. For primary infection, the stability analysis of steady states shows interesting dependence on the time delay involved in the production of antibodies from plasma cells. We demonstrate the existence of a critical value for the immune response parameter, beyond which the infection gets completely cured. For secondary infections with a different serotype, the homologous antibody production is enhanced due to the influence of heterologous antibodies. The antibody production is also controlled by the correlation factor, which is a measure of similarities between the different DENV serotypes involved. Our results agree with clinically observed humoral responses for primary and secondary infections.",Tanvi P. Gujarati1 & G.

2127,The Set of Hausdorff Continuous Functions— The Largest Linear Space of Interval Functions,"Hausdorff continuous (H-continuous) functions are special interval-valued functions which are commonly used in practice, e.g. histograms are such functions. However, in order to avoid arithmetic operations with intervals, such functions are traditionally treated by means of corresponding semi-continuous functions, which are real-valued functions. One difficulty in using H-continuous functions is that, if we add two H-continuous functions that have interval values at same argument using point-wise interval arithmetic, then we may obtain as a result an interval function which is not H-continuous. In this work we define addition so that the set of H-continuous functions is closed under this operation. Moreover, the set of H-continuous functions is turned into a linear space. It has been also proved that this space is the largest linear space of interval functions. These results make H-continuous functions an attractive tool in real analysis and provides a bridge between real and interval analysis.","Roumen Anguelov1, Svetoslav Markov2 & Blagovest Sendov",Reliable Computing,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11155-006-9006-5,"Linear Space,Viscosity Solution,Interval Function,Dense Subset,Continuous Real Function"

2133,Toward a geometrical foundation for physics,"We present the conjecture that the fundamental notions of physics, including such basic concepts as spin, charge(s), mass and spacetime, emerge from a mathematical theory having to do with fluctuations in the metrics of 2-manifolds. This involves looking at a set of 2-manifolds whose metrics depend on a global parameter \(t\), where each manifold is also associated with a set of six parameters whose values change continuously along \(t\) depending on the metrics and associated parameters of all the other manifolds. More intuitively, and specifically, what we do is define objects that generate oscillations on affine planes in \(R^3\), parameterized by the global parameter \(t\), where the plane associated with each object changes continuously along \(t\) depending on the oscillations that are generated by similar objects on other affine planes. We study some typical structures that arise when the oscillations’ amplitudes tend to zero, and show that the state of each such structure at any value of \(t\) can be associated with a real parameter \(0 \leqslant \beta < 1\), and that a special type of interaction with other similar structures exists which results in readjusting the value of \(\beta \). We go on to think of \(R^3\) at any value of \(t\) as corresponding to a hypersphere in \(R^4\) via the stereographic projection, where \(t\) is identified as the logarithm of hypersphere radius in the foliation of \(R^4\) in concentric hyperspheres. This leads to interpreting some curves arising from the structures we study as corresponding to certain \(S^2\) curves. We use both sides of that last correspondence to derive the free Dirac equation as the classical equation of motion of an abstract point particle, where our typical structures and their interactions are understood in connection with electrons interacting with an em radiation field, and the emergent description of any point in spacetime typically involves an infinite number of discrete values of \(t\). The Dirac equation is thus derived from the Frenet equations of our special family of curves, and the physical meaning is determined by the identification of physical and geometrical entities required by the derivation. We propose that the origin of the infinitesimal oscillations in our theory has to do with the axiomatization of the Euclidean plane and the construction of the real numbers. We briefly discuss the relevance of these ideas to the strong interaction and to gravity.",Sharon Eitan,Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40509-014-0022-6,"Foundations of quantum physics,The measurement problem,The Dirac equation,Particle masses,Quantum gravity"

2136,Optimal-control methods for two new classes of smart obstacles in time-dependent acoustic scattering,"Time-dependent acoustic scattering problems involving “smart” obstacles are considered. When hit by an incident acoustic field, smart obstacles react in an attempt to pursue a preassigned goal. Let
\(\mathbb{R}^3\) be the three-dimensional real Euclidean space, and let
\(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3\) be a bounded simply connected open set with a Lipschitz boundary characterized by a constant acoustic boundary impedance χ, immersed in an isotropic and homogeneous medium that fills
\(\mathbb{R}^{3}\backslash\Omega\). The closure of Ω will be denoted as
\(\overline{\Omega}\). When hit by an incident field, the obstacle Ω pursues the preassigned goal through the action of a control input acting on its boundary (i.e., a quantity with dimensions of a pressure divided by a time). The obstacles considered in this paper monitor the control input acting on their boundaries in order to achieve one of the following goals: (i) be furtive in a given set of the frequency space, and (ii) appear in a given set of the frequency space and outside a given set of
\(\mathbb{R}^3\) containing Ω and Ω
G
 as similar as possible to a “ghost” obstacle Ω
G
 having boundary acoustic impedance χ
G
. It is assumed that
\(\overline{\Omega}\cap\overline{\Omega}_G=\emptyset\) and
\(\Omega_G \neq \emptyset\). The problem corresponding to the first goal will be called the definite-band furtivity problem, and the problem corresponding to the second goal will be called the definite-band ghost-obstacle problem. These two goals define two classes of smart obstacles. In this paper, these problems are modeled as optimal-control problems for the wave equation introducing a control input acting on the boundary of Ω for time
\(t \in \mathbb{R}\). The cost functionals proposed depend on the value of the control input on the boundary of the obstacle and on the value of the scattered acoustic field generated by the obstacle on the boundary in the “furtivity case”, and on the boundary of a suitable set containing Ω and Ω
G
 in the “ghost-obstacle case”. Under some assumptions, the use of the Pontryagin maximum principle allows us to formulate the first-order optimality conditions for the definite-band furtivity problem and for the definite-band ghost-obstacle problem as exterior problems outside the obstacle for a system of two coupled wave equations. Numerical methods to solve these exterior problems are developed by extending previous work. These methods belong to the class of the operator-expansion methods that are highly parallelizable. Numerical experiments proving the validity of the control problems proposed as mathematical models of the definite-band furtivity problem and definite-band ghost obstacle problem are presented. The numerical results obtained with a parallel implementation of the numerical methods developed are discussed and their properties are established. The speed-up factors obtained using parallel computing are really impressive.

2137,Denoising and Harmonic Detection Using Nonorthogonal Wavelet Packets in Industrial Applications,"New industrial applications call for new methods and new ideas in signal analysis. Wavelet packets are new tools in industrial applications and they have just recently appeared in projects and patents. In training neural networks, for the sake of dimensionality and of ratio of time, compact information is needed. This paper deals with simultaneous noise suppression and signal compression of quasi-harmonic signals. A quasi-harmonic signal is a signal with one dominant harmonic and some more sub harmonics in superposition. Such signals often occur in rail vehicle systems, in which noisy signals are present. Typically, they are signals which come from rail overhead power lines and are generated by intermodulation phenomena and radio interferences. An important task is to monitor and recognize them. This paper proposes an algorithm to differentiate discrete signals from their noisy observations using a library of nonorthonormal bases. The algorithm combines the shrinkage technique and techniques in regression analysis using Shannon Entropy function and Cross Entropy function to select the best discernable bases. Cosine and sine wavelet bases in wavelet packets are used. The algorithm is totally general and can be used in many industrial applications. The effectiveness of the proposed method consists of using as few as possible samples of the measured signal and in the meantime highlighting the difference between the noise and the desired signal. The problem is a difficult one, but well posed. In fact, compression reduces the level of the measured noise and undesired signals but introduces the well known compression noise. The goal is to extract a coherent signal from the measured signal which will be “well represented” by suitable waveforms and a noisy signal or incoherent signal which cannot be “compressed well” by the waveforms. Recursive residual iterations with cosine and sine bases allow the extraction of elements of the required signal and the noise. The algorithm that has been developed is utilized as a filter to extract features for training neural networks. It is currently integrated in the inferential modelling platform of the unit for Advanced Control and Simulation Solutions within ABB’s industry division. An application using real measured data from an electrical railway line is presented to illustrate and analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method. Another industrial application in fault detection, in which coherent and incoherent signals are univocally visible, is also shown.",P.

As a corollary we deduce that the usual KPZ relation is not satisfied.

To support this, we introduce a real-time software architecture description language, named Prelude, which is built upon the synchronous languages and which provides a high level of abstraction for describing the functional and the real-time architecture of a multi-periodic control system. A program is translated into a set of real-time tasks that can be executed on a monoprocessor real-time platform with an on-line priority-based scheduler such as Deadline-Monotonic or Earliest-Deadline-First. The compilation is formally proved correct, meaning that the generated code respects the real-time semantics of the original program (respect of periods, deadlines, release dates and precedences) as well as its functional semantics (respect of variable consumption).","Claire Pagetti1,2, Julien Forget3, Frédéric Boniol1, Mikel Cordovilla1 & …David Lesens",Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10626-011-0107-x,"Real-time,Synchronous languages,Preemptive multitasking,Embedded systems"

It will be shown here, through rigorous mathematical reasoning, that these non-singular kernel derivatives suffer from several drawbacks which should forbid their use. They fail to satisfy the fundamental theorem of fractional calculus since they do not admit the existence of a corresponding convolution integral of which the derivative is the left-inverse; and the value of the derivative at the initial time t = 0 is always zero, which imposes an unnatural restriction on the differential equations and models where these derivatives can be used. For the particular cases of the so-called Caputo-Fabrizio and Atangana-Baleanu derivatives, it is shown that when this restriction holds the derivative can be simply expressed in terms of integer derivatives and standard Caputo fractional derivatives, thus demonstrating that these derivatives contain nothing new.","Kai Diethelm1,5, Roberto Garrappa2,6, Andrea Giusti3 & …Martin Stynes",Fractional Calculus and Applied Analysis,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1515/fca-2020-0032,"Primary: 26A33,34A08,Secondary: 35R11"

The kernel of each operator is the autocorrelation function of the signal, which is radiated in the given direction. Spectral representation of the operators gives a fast-converging series representation of the ERI. For the signals, whose Fourier transforms are rational functions of the frequency, spectral analysis of the operators is reduced to finite-dimensional linear systems. Moreover, for such signals we express the ERI as the linear combination of the monochromatic directivity diagrams, evaluated in the complex poles of the signal’s Fourier transform. For the isotropic array elements and the most important amplitude distributions the ERI is obtained explicitly. We consider in detail a signal given by a truncated decaying exponent.

Consequently, techniques from linear feedback control theory do not apply. We concentrate on the question of finding real valued gains so that the A matrix of the state space model has a prescribed characteristic polynomial. We find that three of the coefficients can be arbitrarily picked, but that the remaining are constrained by these and the other system parameters. Our techniques use methods from constructive algebraic geometry.","Billye Cheek1, Mieczyslaw Dabkowski1, Amr El Nagdi2, Louis R. Hunt2, T. P. LaFave Jr2, Ke Liu2, Duncan L.

There are three control parameters and three different nonlinear terms in the governed equations. The new chaotic system has six equilibrium points. Basic dynamic properties of the new system are investigated via theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. The nonlinear characteristic of the new chaotic system are demonstrated in terms of equilibria, Jacobian matrices, Lyapunov exponents, a dissipative system, Poincaré maps and bifurcations. Then, an adaptive control law is derived to make the states of two identical chaotic systems asymptotically synchronized based on the Lyapunov stability theory.

The model involves the concentrations of uninfected cells, infected cells, free virus, CTL response cells, and antibody antibody response cells. There are three delays in the model: the intracellular delay, virus replication delay and the antibody delay. The basic reproductive number of viral infection, the antibody immune reproductive number, the CTL immune reproductive number, the CTL immune competitive reproductive number and the antibody immune competitive reproductive number are derived. By means of Lyapunov functionals and LaSalle’s invariance principle, sufficient conditions for the stability of each equilibrium is established. The results show that the intracellular delay and virus replication delay do not impact upon the stability of each equilibrium, but when the antibody delay is positive, Hopf bifurcation at the antibody response and the interior equilibrium will exist by using the antibody delay as a bifurcation parameter. Numerical simulations are carried out to justify the analytical results.","Junxian Yang

2171,Logical analysis of numerical data,"“Logical analysis of data” (LAD) is a methodology developed since the late eighties, aimed at discovering hidden structural information in data sets. LAD was originally developed for analyzing binary data by using the theory of partially defined Boolean functions. An extension of LAD for the analysis of numerical data sets is achieved through the process of “binarization” consisting in the replacement of each numerical variable by binary “indicator” variables, each showing whether the value of the original variable is above or below a certain level. Binarization was successfully applied to the analysis of a variety of real life data sets. This paper develops the theoretical foundations of the binarization process studying the combinatorial optimization problems related to the minimization of the number of binary variables. To provide an algorithmic framework for the practical solution of such problems, we construct compact linear integer programming formulations of them. We develop polynomial time algorithms for some of these minimization problems, and prove NP-hardness of others.","Endre Boros1, Peter L.

We prove that minimal metrics (if any) are unique up to isometry and scaling, they develop soliton solutions for the ‘invariant Ricci’ flow and are characterized as the critical points of a natural variational problem. The uniqueness allows us to distinguish two geometric structures with Riemannian data, giving rise to a great deal of invariants.Our approach proposes to vary Lie brackets rather than inner products; our tool is the moment map for the action of a reductive Lie group on the algebraic variety of all Lie algebras, which we show to coincide in this setting with the Ricci operator.

2187, Elimination of Skolem functions for monotone formulas in analysis," In this paper a new method, elimination of Skolem functions for monotone formulas, is developed which makes it possible to determine precisely the arithmetical strength of instances of various non-constructive function existence principles. This is achieved by reducing the use of such instances in a given proof to instances of certain arithmetical principles. Our framework are systems \({\cal T}^{\omega} :={\rm G}_n{\rm A}^{\omega} +{\rm AC}\)-qf \(+\Delta\), where (G\(_n\)A\(^{\omega})_{n \in {\Bbb N}}\) is a hierarchy of (weak) subsystems of arithmetic in all finite types (introduced in [14]), AC-qf is the schema of quantifier-free choice in all types and \(\Delta\) is a set of certain analytical principles which e.g. includes the binary König's lemma. We apply this method to show that the arithmetical closures of single instances of \(\Pi^0_1\)-comprehension and -choice contribute to the growth of extractable bounds from proofs relative to \({\cal T}^\omega\) only by a primitive recursive functional in the sense of Kleene. In subsequent papers these results are widely generalized and the method is used to determine the arithmetical content of single sequences of instances of the Bolzano-Weierstraß principle for bounded sequences in \({\Bbb R}^d\), the Ascoli-lemma and others.

2190,A mixture of fuzzy filters applied to the analysis of heartbeat intervals,"This study provides a stochastic modeling of the heartbeat intervals using a mixture of Takagi–Sugeno type fuzzy filters. The model parameters are inferred under variational Bayes (VB) framework. The model of the heartbeat intervals is in the form of a history-dependent probability density. The parameters, characterizing the heartbeat intervals probability density, include the estimated parameters of different fuzzy filters and may serve as the features of the heartbeat interval series. The features of the heartbeat intervals provide a description of the physiological state of an individual. A novelty of our analysis method is that the physiological state is predicted as a part of the features extraction procedure. This is done via deriving, using VB paradigm, an analytical expression for the posterior distribution that the observed heartbeat intervals have been generated by the stochastic model of the physiological state. The method is illustrated with the data of 40 healthy subjects studied in a tilt-table experiment.","Mohit Kumar1, Matthias Weippert2, Norbert Stoll3 & …Regina Stoll",Fuzzy Optimization and Decision Making,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10700-010-9089-7,"Fuzzy filtering,R–R interval,Heart rate variability,Variational Bayes,Probability distribution"
2191,Path Capacity Dimensioning in a Multiprotocol Label Switched Network: Analysis of Optimal and Suboptimal Solutions,"In recent years, the problem of capacity allocation for a label switched patch (LSP) in a multiprotocol label switched (MPLS) network has received great attention due to its relevance in the context of traffic control. In this paper, the problem of capacity allocation is formulated as an optimal control problem and its solution is obtained by assuming the knowledge of the bandwidth requests on the entire control interval. A suboptimal solution is also given which has the advantage of requiring limited information about future bandwidth requests. The analysis of the suboptimal solution is explored both analytically and numerically by using simulated and real data. This study demonstrates that the suboptimal solution, also with limited knowledge of the future, yields a good approximation of the optimal one and requires little additional cost.","C. Bruni1, C.

2193,Car-following model with explicit reaction-time delay: linear stability analysis of a uniform solution on a ring,"A microscopic car-following model with an explicit reaction-time delay is considered. The acceleration of every vehicle depends on its actual speed, the predecessor speed, and the distance between them. The acceleration function explicitly includes the driver’s reaction-time delay. On the one hand, this is an undoubted advantage of the model, and on the other hand, it significantly complicates the mathematical analysis. The subject of the study is the stability analysis of the uniform solutions on a ring. Using the linear stability analysis, we obtained the conditions on the model parameters including the driver’s reaction time, for which perturbations around the uniform solution decay. The calculations show that there are values for the model parameters, which satisfy the obtained conditions and at the same time provide a realistic dynamic of the vehicles. An important result is the fact that this model is able to reproduce such phenomenon as propagation of stop-and-go waves, which are widely known in traffic flow theory and are observed in practice. The latter is another advantage of the proposed car-following model.",V. V. Kurtc1 & I. E.

Such systems can be viewed, in particular, as solution sets to problems of generalized semi-infinite programming with polynomial data. Exploiting the imposed polynomial structure together with powerful tools of variational analysis and semialgebraic geometry, we establish a far-going extension of the Łojasiewicz gradient inequality to the general nonsmooth class of supremum marginal functions as well as higher-order (Hölder type) local error bounds results with explicitly calculated exponents. The obtained results are applied to higher-order quantitative stability analysis for various classes of optimization problems including generalized semi-infinite programming with polynomial data, optimization of real polynomials under polynomial matrix inequality constraints, and polynomial second-order cone programming. Other applications provide explicit convergence rate estimates for the cyclic projection algorithm to find common points of convex sets described by matrix polynomial inequalities and for the asymptotic convergence of trajectories of subgradient dynamical systems in semialgebraic settings.","G.

Such models interpolate between spatially implicit resource selection analysis (RSA) and advection-diffusion models, possessing these two models as limiting cases. We find a closed-form solution for the steady-state (equilibrium) probability distribution u* using a factorization of the redistribution operator into symmetric and diagonal parts. How space use is controlled by the habitat preference function w depends on the characteristic width of the animals’ redistribution kernel: when the redistribution kernel is wide relative to variation in w, u* ∝ w, whereas when it is narrow relative to variation in w, u* ∝ w
2. In addition, we analyze the behavior at discontinuities in w which occur at habitat type boundaries, and simulate the dynamics of space use given two-dimensional prey-availability data, exploring the effect of the redistribution kernel width. Our factorization allows such numerical simulations to be done extremely fast; we expect this to aid the computationally intensive task of model parameter fitting and inverse modeling.",Alex H.

This first paper is a review on super-differential calculus for the concrete model of the superspace (invented by Vladimirov and Volovich). In the next review we plan to present the integral supercalculus. The main distinguishing feature of functional superanalysis is that this is a real super-extension of analysis of Newton and Leibniz, opposite to algebraic models of Martin and Berezin. Here functions of commuting and anticommuting variables are no simply algebraic elements belonging to Grassmann algebras, but point-wise maps, from superspace into superspace.

2213,Predicting effective control parameters for differential evolution using cluster analysis of objective function features,"A methodology is introduced which uses three simple objective function features to predict effective control parameters for differential evolution. This is achieved using cluster analysis techniques to classify objective functions using these features. Information on prior performance of various control parameters for each classification is then used to determine which control parameters to use in future optimisations. Our approach is compared to state-of-the-art adaptive and non-adaptive techniques. Two accepted bench mark suites are used to compare performance and in all cases we show that the improvement resulting from our approach is statistically significant. The majority of the computational effort of this methodology is performed off-line, however even when taking into account the additional on-line cost our approach outperforms other adaptive techniques. We also investigate the key tuning parameters of our methodology, such as number of clusters, which further support the finding that the simple features selected are predictors of effective control parameters. The findings presented in this paper are significant because they show that simple to calculate features of objective functions can help to select control parameters for optimisation algorithms. This can have an immediate positive impact on the application of these optimisation algorithms on real world problems, where it is often difficult to select effective control parameters.","Sean P.

2215,Rimming flows within a rotating horizontal cylinder: asymptotic analysis of the thin-film lubrication equations and stability of their solutions,"It is well-known that a standard lubrication analysis of the equations of motion in thin liquid films coating the inside surface of a rotating horizontal cylinder leads, under creeping-flow conditions, to a cubic equation for the film thickness profile which, depending on the fluid properties of the liquid, the speed of rotation and the fill fraction F, has either (a) a continuous, symmetric (homogeneous) solution; (b) a solution containing a shock; or (c) no solution below a certain speed. By means of an asymptotic analysis of the recently proposed “modified lubrication equation” (MLE) [M. Tirumkudulu and A. Acrivos, Phys. Fluid 13 (2000) 14–19], it is shown that the solutions of the cubic equation referred to above correctly describe the film-thickness profiles although, when shocks are involved, under exceedingly restrictive conditions, typically F~ 10−3 or less. In addition, using the MLE, the linear stability of these film profiles is investigated and it is shown that: the “homogeneous” profiles are neutrally stable if surface-tension effects are neglected but, if the latter are retained, the films are asymptotically stable to two-dimensional disturbances and unstable to axial disturbances; on the other hand, the non-homogeneous profiles are always asymptotically stable, thus confirming results given earlier [T.B.

2220,Minimization approach to membership evaluation in fuzzy sets and error analysis,"Evaluation of the degree of membership in fuzzy sets is a fundamental topic in fuzzy set theory. Saaty (Ref. 1) proposes a method for solving this problem that has been widely accepted. In this paper, we examine the problem from an error minimization point of view that attempts to reflect the real intentions of the decision maker. When this approach is used, the findings reveal that fuzzy sets of different cardinalities have dramatically different requirements in the consistency level of the input data as far as the error minimization criterion is concerned.","E.

2221,Analysis of phase transformation from austenite to martensite in NiTi alloy strips under uniaxial tension,"Phase transformation from austenite to martensite in NiTi alloy strips under the uniaxial tension has been observed in experiments and numerically simulated as a localized deformation. This work presents an analysis using the theory of phase transformation. The jump of deformation gradient across the interface between two phases and the Maxwell relation are considered. Governing equations for the phase transformation are derived. The analysis is reduced to finding the minimum value of the loading at which the governing equations have a unique, real and physically acceptable solution. The equations are solved numerically and it is verified that the unique solution exists definitely. The Maxwell stress, the stresses and strains inside both austenite and martensite phases, and the transformation-front orientation angle are determined to be in reasonably good agreement with experimental observations.","Xie Yu-xin

2222,Numerical Analysis of Spatial Hydrodynamic Stability of Shear Flows in Ducts of Constant Cross Section,"A technique for analyzing the spatial stability of viscous incompressible shear flows in ducts of constant cross section, i.e., a technique for the numerical analysis of the stability of such flows with respect to small time-harmonic disturbances propagating downstream is described and justified. According to this technique, the linearized equations for the disturbance amplitudes are approximated in space in the plane of the duct cross section and are reduced to a system of first-order ordinary differential equations in the streamwise variable in a way independent of the approximation method. This system is further reduced to a lower dimension one satisfied only by physically significant solutions of the original system. Most of the computations are based on standard matrix algorithms. This technique makes it possible to efficiently compute various characteristics of spatial stability, including finding optimal disturbances that play a crucial role in the subcritical laminar–turbulent transition scenario. The performance of the technique is illustrated as applied to the Poiseuille flow in a duct of square cross section.","A. V. Boiko1, K. V. Demyanko2,3 & Yu. M.

These equations represent an abstract form of the Gurtin–Pipkin integrodifferential equation describing the process of heat conduction in media with memory and the process of sound conduction in viscoelastic media and arise in averaging problems in perforated media (the Darcy law).The correct solvability of initial-boundary problems for the specified equations is established in weighted Sobolev spaces on a positive semiaxis.Spectral problems for operator-functions are analyzed.

We also use a way of analyzing the oxygen uptake kinetics using a plot of
\(\ddot{V}O_{2}(t)\)
vs
\(\dot{V}O_{2}(t)\)
which allows one to observe both the fixed point solutions and also the presence of speeded oxygen kinetics following training. A method of plotting the eigenvalue versus oxygen demand is also used which allows one to observe where the maximum amplitude of the so-called slow component will be and also how training has changed the oxygen uptake kinetics by changing the strength of the attracting fixed point for a particular demand.","J.

2225,Valuative analysis of planar plurisubharmonic functions,"We show that valuations on the ring R of holomorphic germs in dimension 2 may be naturally evaluated on plurisubharmonic functions, giving rise to generalized Lelong numbers in the sense of Demailly. Any plurisubharmonic function thus defines a real-valued function on the set \(\mathcal{V}\) of valuations on R and – by way of a natural Laplace operator defined in terms of the tree structure on \(\mathcal{V}\) – a positive measure on \(\mathcal{V}\). This measure contains a great deal of information on the singularity at the origin. Under mild regularity assumptions, it yields an exact formula for the mixed Monge-Ampère mass of two plurisubharmonic functions. As a consequence, any generalized Lelong number can be interpreted as an average of valuations. Using our machinery we also show that the singularity of any positive closed (1,1) current T can be attenuated in the following sense: there exists a finite composition of blowups such that the pull-back of T decomposes into two parts, the first associated to a divisor with normal crossing support, the second having small Lelong numbers.

2227,Analysis of dynamic instability of interfacial slip waves based on the surface impedance tensor,"A new method relying on the Stroh formulism and the theory of the surface impedance tensor was developed to investigate the dynamic instability of interfacial slip waves. The concept of the surface impedance tensor was extended to the case where the wave speed is of a complex value, and the boundary conditions at the frictionally contacting interface were expressed by the surface impedance tensor. Then the boundary value problem was transformed to searching for zeroes of a complex polynomial in the unit circle. As an example, the steady frictional sliding of an elastic half-space in contact with a rigid flat surface was considered in details. A quartic complex characteristic equation was derived and its solution behavior in the unit circle was discussed. An explicit expression for the instability condition of the interfacial slip waves was presented.","Li Nan Doctor1, Wang Yue-sheng1 & Yu Gui-lan",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2004,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02438351,"frictional contact,slip wave,instability,Stroh formalism,surface impedance tensor"
2228,A mathematical model for breath gas analysis of volatile organic compounds with special emphasis on acetone,"Recommended standardized procedures for determining exhaled lower respiratory nitric oxide and nasal nitric oxide (NO) have been developed by task forces of the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society. These recommendations have paved the way for the measurement of nitric oxide to become a diagnostic tool for specific clinical applications. It would be desirable to develop similar guidelines for the sampling of other trace gases in exhaled breath, especially volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which may reflect ongoing metabolism. The concentrations of water-soluble, blood-borne substances in exhaled breath are influenced by: (i) breathing patterns affecting gas exchange in the conducting airways, (ii) the concentrations in the tracheo-bronchial lining fluid, (iii) the alveolar and systemic concentrations of the compound. The classical Farhi equation takes only the alveolar concentrations into account. Real-time measurements of acetone in end-tidal breath under an ergometer challenge show characteristics which cannot be explained within the Farhi setting. Here we develop a compartment model that reliably captures these profiles and is capable of relating breath to the systemic concentrations of acetone. By comparison with experimental data it is inferred that the major part of variability in breath acetone concentrations (e.g., in response to moderate exercise or altered breathing patterns) can be attributed to airway gas exchange, with minimal changes of the underlying blood and tissue concentrations. Moreover, the model illuminates the discrepancies between observed and theoretically predicted blood-breath ratios of acetone during resting conditions, i.e., in steady state. Particularly, the current formulation includes the classical Farhi and the Scheid series inhomogeneity model as special limiting cases and thus is expected to have general relevance for a wider range of blood-borne inert gases. The chief intention of the present modeling study is to provide mechanistic relationships for further investigating the exhalation kinetics of acetone and other water-soluble species. This quantitative approach is a first step towards new guidelines for breath gas analyses of volatile organic compounds, similar to those for nitric oxide.","Julian King1, Karl Unterkofler1,2, Gerald Teschl3, Susanne Teschl4, Helin Koc2, Hartmann Hinterhuber5 & …Anton Amann1,",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-010-0398-9,"Breath gas analysis,Volatile organic compounds,Acetone,Modeling"

The new sampling strategy enables the definition of efficient hierarchical sample reuse algorithms that reduce significantly the computational complexity and make it independent of the dimension of the uncertainty space. Moreover, the authors show that there exists a one to one correspondence between the new and the existing robustness measures and provide a computationally simple algorithm to derive one from the other.","Xinjia Chen1, Kemin Zhou2 & Jorge Aravena",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-009-9144-z,"Computational complexity,randomized algorithms,risk analysis,robustness analysis,uncertain system"

2232,Network analysis of internal migration in Croatia,"Migration, and urbanization as its consequence, is among the most intricate political and scientific topics, predicted to have huge effects on human lives in the near future. Thus being said, previous works have mainly focused on international migration, and the research on internal migration outside of the US is scarce, and in the case of Europe—the ubiquitous center of migration affairs—only in its infancy. Observing migration between settlements, especially using network analysis indicators and models, can help to explain and predict migration, as well as urbanization originating from internal migration. We therefore conducted a network analysis of internal migration in Croatia, providing insights into the size of internal migration in population, and relative sizes between intra-settlement migration, inter-settlement migration and population. Through centrality analysis, we provide insights into hierarchy of importance, especially, in terms of the overall flow and overall attractiveness of particular settlements in the network. The analysis of the network structure reveals high presence of reciprocity and thus the importance of internal migration to urbanization, as well as the systematic abandonment of large cities in the east of the country. The application of three different community detection algorithms provides insights for the policy domain in terms of the compatibility of the current country administrative subdivision schemes and the subdivision implied by migration patterns. For network scholars, the analysis at hand reveals the status quo in applied network analysis to migration, the works published, the measures used, and potential metrics outside those applied which may be used to better explain and predict the intricate phenomenon of human migration.","Dino Pitoski

The high dimensionality, structural complexity, the nonlinearity, and entanglements of biomolecular data, ranging from DNA knots, RNA secondary structures, protein folding configurations, chromosomes, DNA origami, molecular assembly, to others at the macromolecular level, pose a severe challenge in their analysis and characterization. In the past few decades, mathematical concepts, models, algorithms, and tools from algebraic topology, combinatorial topology, computational topology, and topological data analysis, have demonstrated great power and begun to play an essential role in tackling the biomolecular data challenge. In this work, we introduce biomolecular topology, which concerns the topological problems and models originated from the biomolecular systems. More specifically, the biomolecular topology encompasses topological structures, properties and relations that are emerged from biomolecular structures, dynamics, interactions, and functions. We discuss the various types of biomolecular topology from structures (of proteins, DNAs, and RNAs), protein folding, and protein assembly. A brief discussion of databanks (and databases), theoretical models, and computational algorithms, is presented.

2238,A comparative analysis of probabilistic linguistic preference relations and distributed preference relations for decision making,"When a decision-maker prefers to compare different alternatives in pairs to handle real situations, there are many different expression styles that can be used. Two representative expression styles are the probabilistic linguistic preference relation (PLPR), which originates from the fuzzy linguistic approach and the distributed preference relation (DPR), which originates from the evidential reasoning approach. Although these two expression styles look quite similar, their meanings, operations, and relevant decision making processes are significantly different. This presents the decision-maker with the challenge of selecting either PLPRs or DPRs in different real cases. To address this issue, this paper provides a detailed analysis of the similarities and differences between PLPRs and DPRs. The analysis is conducted from five perspectives, including modeling of decision making problems, handling of uncertainty, consistency between preference relations, information aggregation, and elicitation process. An engineer selection problem for an automobile manufacturing enterprise is investigated to demonstrate how to appropriately select PLPRs or DPRs to model and analyze decision making problems in real situations with consideration for the preferences of decision-makers.","Min Xue1,2,3, Chao Fu

The conditions of the junction between the spherical and the cylindrical shell segments are given by the continuity of deformation and the equilibrium relations near the junction point. The mathematical model of problem is reduced to as an eigenvalue problem for a system of ordinary differential equations in two separate domains corresponding to the spherical and the cylindrical shell segments.

2243,A complete asymptotic analysis of an oscillation free nonlinear equation of Bessel type with a pole in the dependent variable,"We characterize the set of solutions of a nonlinear perturbation of Bessel’s equation of order zero on a half line, where the nonlinearity is analytic in the independent variable, algebraic in the dependent variable, and, indeed, admits a pole in this variable. We show that the equation fails the Painlevé test and that there are no points in [0, ∞), where the blow-up occurs. Although we cannot find even one closed-form solution, it is shown that there are only four families of solutions: asymptotically linear and increasing, asymptotically linear and decreasing, a set of asymptotically constant solutions, and a final set of solutions that admit singularities at finite points on [0, ∞). As a consequence, we show that every solution with or without singularities on [0, ∞) is nonoscillatory and, in fact, has at most two zeros. We also show that the plane Π of real initial conditions (y(0), y′(0)) can be decomposed into a union of connected regions in each of which the solutions are exactly of one of the types mentioned above. Furthermore, we conclude that the set of initial conditions leading to asymptotically constant solutions is a piecewise differentiable curve in Π that can be estimated theoretically to a high degree of precision. In addition, the asymptotic behavior of solutions near a finite singularity is obtained. Estimates relating the growth of solutions to their initial conditions are also described and numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theory. Finally, we observe that every solution of our equation has finite singularities when considered as a solution on the whole line.","A. B. Mingarelli1, J. M. Pacheco-Castelao2 & S.

2247,The singularly perturbed Hodgkin-Huxley equations as a tool for the analysis of repetitive nerve activity,"A qualitative analysis of the Hodgkin-Huxley model (Hodgkin and Huxley 1952), which closely mimics the ionic processes at a real nerve membrane, is performed by means of a singular perturbation theory. This was achieved by introducing a perturbation parameter that, if decreased, “speeds up” the fast variables of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations (membrane potential and sodium activation), whereas it does not affect the slow variables (sodium inactivation and potassium activation). In the most extreme case, if the perturbation parameter is set to zero, the original four-dimensional system “degenerates” to a system with only two differential equations. This degenerate system is easier to analyze and much more intuitive than the original Hodgkin-Huxley equations. It shows, like the original model, an infinite train of action potentials if stimulated by an input current in a suitable range. Additionally, explanations for the increased sensitivity to depolarizing current steps that precedes an action potential can be found by analysis of the degenerate system. Using the theory of Mishchenko and Rozov (1980) it is shown that the degenerate system does not only represent a simplification of the original Hodgkin-Huxley equations but also gives a valid approximation of the original model at least for stimulating currents that are constant within a suitable range.","F.

2248,Formal analysis of resonance entrainment by central pattern generator,"The neuronal circuit controlling the rhythmic movements in animal locomotion is called the central pattern generator (CPG). The biological control mechanism appears to exploit mechanical resonance to achieve efficient locomotion. The objective of this paper is to reveal the fundamental mechanism underlying entrainment of CPGs to resonance through sensory feedback. To uncover the essential principle, we consider the simplest setting where a pendulum is driven by the reciprocal inhibition oscillator. Existence and properties of stable oscillations are examined by the harmonic balance method, which enables approximate but insightful analysis. In particular, analytical conditions are obtained under which harmonic balance predicts existence of an oscillation at a frequency near the resonance frequency. Our result reveals that the resonance entrainment can be maintained robustly against parameter perturbations through two distinct mechanisms: negative integral feedback and positive rate feedback.",Y.

2249,"Dispersion Analysis of Discontinuous Galerkin Schemes Applied to Poincaré, Kelvin and Rossby Waves","
A technique for analyzing dispersion properties of numerical schemes is proposed. The method is able to deal with both non dispersive or dispersive waves, i.e. waves for which the phase speed varies with wavenumber. It can be applied to unstructured grids and to finite domains with or without periodic boundary conditions.

We consider the discrete version L of a linear differential operator ℒ. An eigenvalue analysis of L gives eigenfunctions and eigenvalues (l

i
,λ

i
). The spatially resolved modes are found out using a standard a posteriori error estimation procedure applied to eigenmodes. Resolved eigenfunctions l

i
’s are used to determine numerical wavenumbers k

i
’s. Eigenvalues’ imaginary parts are the wave frequencies ω

i
 and a discrete dispersion relation ω

i
=f(k

i
) is constructed and compared with the exact dispersion relation of the continuous operator ℒ. Real parts of eigenvalues λ

i
’s allow to compute dissipation errors of the scheme for each given class of wave.

The method is applied to the discontinuous Galerkin discretization of shallow water equations in a rotating framework with a variable Coriolis force. Such a model exhibits three families of dispersive waves, including the slow Rossby waves that are usually difficult to analyze. In this paper, we present dissipation and dispersion errors for Rossby, Poincaré and Kelvin waves. We exhibit the strong superconvergence of numerical wave numbers issued of discontinuous Galerkin discretizations for all families of waves. In particular, the theoretical superconvergent rates, demonstrated for a one dimensional linear transport equation, for dissipation and dispersion errors are obtained in this two dimensional model with a variable Coriolis parameter for the Kelvin and Poincaré waves.

2250,Electric admittance analysis of quartz crystal resonator in thickness-shear mode induced by array of surface viscoelastic micro-beams,"The electric admittance of a compound system composed of a thicknessshear mode (TSM) quartz crystal resonator (QCR) and an array of surface viscoelastic micro-beams (MBs) is studied. The governing equations of the MBs are derived from the Timoshenko-beam theory in consideration of shear deformation. The electrical admittance is described directly in terms of the physical properties of the surface epoxy resin (SU-8) MBs from an electrically forced vibration analysis. It is found that both the inertia effect and the constraint effect of the MBs produce competitive influence on the resonant frequency and admittance of the compound QCR system. By further comparing the numerical results calculated from the Timoshenko-beam model with those from the Euler-beam model, the shear deformation is found to lead to some deviation of an admittance spectrum. The deviations are revealed to be evident around the admittance peak(s) and reach the maximum when a natural frequency of the MBs is identical to the fundamental frequency of the QCR. Besides, a higher order vibration mode of the MBs corresponds to a larger deviation at the resonance.",Jiemin Xie1 & Yuantai Hu,Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-017-2154-6,"quartz crystal resonator (QCR),thickness-shear mode (TSM),electrical admittance,shear deformation"

The argument centers around the fact that the only way to judge the reliability of a system is by comparison to a specification of the requirements. This paper also points to methods for documenting the requirements. In particular, a requirements template is proposed for specifying engineering computation software. To make the mathematical specification easily understandable by all stakeholders, the requirements documentation employs the technique of using tabular expressions. To clarify the presentation, this paper includes a case study of the documentation for a system for analyzing statically determinant beams.","Spencer Smith1, Lei Lai1 & Ridha Khedri",Reliable Computing,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11155-006-9020-7,"Requirement Analysis,Requirement Engineer,Software Requirement,Requirement Elicitation,Requirement Document"

Assuming that two random bases can form a hydrogen bond with probability p we prove asymptotic equivalents for the averaged number of hairpins and bulges, the averaged loop length, the expected order, the expected number of secondary structures of size n and order k and further parameters all depending on p. In this way we get an insight into the change of shape of a random structure during the process \(1\mathop \to \limits^p 0\). Afterwards we compare the computed parameters for random structures in the Bernoulli model to the corresponding quantities for real existing secondary structures of large subunit rRNA molecules found in the database of Wuyts et al. That is how it becomes possible to identify those parameters which behave (almost) randomly and those which do not and thus should be considered as interesting, e.g., with respect to the biological functions or the algorithmic prediction of RNA secondary structures.",Markus E.

Considering a special urban network and the rescuers’ communication, this paper focuses on the real-time rescue routing problem from a source node to an emergency spot. There are some uncertain edge blockages, which cannot be observed in advance. Our goal is to make all the rescuers arrive at the emergency spot as quickly as possible. We study the problem in two scenarios: (1) without communication \((S_1)\), the rescuers can not communicate with the others; (2) with complete communication \((S_2)\), the rescuers can share their information about the tracks and the detected edge blockages instantaneously. These two scenarios are both analyzed on the grid network and the general network, respectively. The results of worst case analysis indicate that the consideration of both the grid network and the rescuers’ communication can significantly improve the rescue efficiency.","Yinfeng Xu1,2 & Huili Zhang1,",Journal of Combinatorial Optimization,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10878-013-9681-1,"Routing,Shortest path,Rescuers’ communication ,Grid network,Worst-case analysis"

The model leads to a nonlinear Volterra integral equation of convolution type. We are interested in the bifurcation of periodic solutions from a constant solution (the endemic state) as a certain parameter (the population size) is varied. Thus we are led to study a characteristic equation. Our main result gives a fairly detailed description (in terms of Fourier coefficients of the kernel) of the traffic of roots across the imaginary axis. As a corollary we obtain the following: if the period of immunity is longer than the preceding period of incubation and infectivity, then the endemic state is unstable for large population sizes and at least one periodic solution will originate.",O.

It is shown that even in such a simple model there exist certain regions of parameters for which fast variables oscillate.

As an elementary consequence of this theorem, we derive a version of the rate-conservation law under conditions more general than previously given in the literature. We then focus on relations between continuous-time state frequencies and frequencies at the points of an imbedded point process, giving necessary and sufficient conditions for theASTA (Arrivals See Time Averages), conditionalASTA, and reversedASTA properties. In addition, we provide a unified approach for proving various relations involving forward and backward recurrence times.

The trade crisis corresponding to the US subprime crisis spreads faster than before, which has struck worldwide foreign trade. In order to get the main factors affecting trade crisis, the authors construct composite indices which are proxies of economic growth and price levels of internal and external regions. The results of logistic and linear panel models show that economic growth affects more to trade cycle than price level. The results of panel models with dummy variable of trade crisis show that the outside economic growth do bad to the recovery of internal foreign trade during trade crisis corresponding to Mexican peso crisis, the Asian financial crisis and the Russian debt crisis, while the opposite is true during the internet bubble burst and the US subprime crisis.","Lili Zhang1, Xun Zhang1 & Ke Cheng",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-015-3270-6,"Business cycle,foreign trade crisis,foreign trade cycle,MS-VAR model,panel model"

The multiplicity of this map is a biholomorphic invariant that is precisely the Moser invariant of the image, when it is a Bishop surface with vanishing Bishop invariant. In higher dimensions, we study Levi-flat CR singular images and we prove that the set of CR singular points must be large, and in the case of codimension 2, necessarily Levi-flat or complex. We also show that there exist real-analytic CR functions on such images that satisfy the tangential CR conditions at the singular points, yet fail to extend to holomorphic functions in a neighborhood.

2277,Stochastic stable population growth in integral projection models: theory and application,"Stochastic matrix projection models are widely used to model age- or stage-structured populations with vital rates that fluctuate randomly over time. Practical applications of these models rest on qualitative properties such as the existence of a long term population growth rate, asymptotic log-normality of total population size, and weak ergodicity of population structure. We show here that these properties are shared by a general stochastic integral projection model, by using results in (Eveson in D. Phil. Thesis, University of Sussex, 1991, Eveson in Proc. Lond.

Integral projection models allow individuals to be cross-classified by multiple attributes, either discrete or continuous, and allow the classification to change during the life cycle. These features are present in plant populations with size and age as important predictors of individual fate, populations with a persistent bank of dormant seeds or eggs, and animal species with complex life cycles. We also present a case-study based on a 6-year field study of the Illyrian thistle, Onopordum illyricum, to demonstrate how easily a stochastic integral model can be parameterized from field data and then applied using familiar matrix software and methods. Thistle demography is affected by multiple traits (size, age and a latent “quality” variable), which would be difficult to accomodate in a classical matrix model. We use the model to explore the evolution of size- and age-dependent flowering using an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) approach. We find close agreement between the observed flowering behavior and the predicted ESS from the stochastic model, whereas the ESS predicted from a deterministic version of the model is very different from observed flowering behavior. These results strongly suggest that the flowering strategy in O. illyricum is an adaptation to random between-year variation in vital rates.",Stephen P.

2278,Analyzing Security Protocols Using Time-Bounded Task-PIOAs,"This paper presents the time-bounded task-PIOA modeling framework, an extension of the probabilistic input/output automata (PIOA) framework that can be used for modeling and verifying security protocols. Time-bounded task-PIOAs can describe probabilistic and nondeterministic behavior, as well as time-bounded computation. Together, these features support modeling of important aspects of security protocols, including secrecy requirements and limitations on the computational power of adversarial parties. They also support security protocol verification using methods that are compatible with less formal approaches used in the computational cryptography research community. We illustrate the use of our framework by outlining a proof of functional correctness and security properties for a well-known oblivious transfer protocol.","Ran Canetti1,2, Ling Cheung2, Dilsun Kaynar3, Moses Liskov4, Nancy Lynch2, Olivier Pereira5 & …Roberto Segala",Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10626-007-0032-1,"Security protocols,Time-bounded task-PIOAs,Probabilistic input/output automata,Oblivious transfer"

This system was solved globally using an interval method by Ratschek and Rokne (1993) in the box [0, 10]9. Their algorithm had enormous costs (i.e., over 14 months using a network of 30 Sun Sparc-1 workstations) but they state that ‘at this time, we know no other method which has been applied to this circuit design problem and which has led to the same guaranteed result of locating exactly one solution in this huge domain, completed with a reliable error estimate’. The present paper gives a novel branch-and-prune algorithm that obtains a unique safe box for the above system within reasonable computation times.

Through weakly nonlinear analysis and direct numerical simulation of an averaged model, it is shown that this bifurcation is subcritical for typical parameter values, leading to hysteresis in the transition to the oscillatory state: there may thus be undesirable large-amplitude oscillations in the output voltages, even when q is below the linear stability threshold value q

These include \(L_p\)-norms and additively weighted Euclidean distances. Our data structure supports general (convex, pairwise disjoint) sites that have constant description complexity (e.g., points, line segments, disks, etc.). Our structure uses \(O(n \log ^3 n)\) storage, and requires polylogarithmic update and query time, improving an earlier data structure of Agarwal, Efrat, and Sharir which required \(O(n^{\varepsilon })\) time for an update and \(O(\log n)\) time for a query [SICOMP 1999]. Our data structure has numerous applications. In all of them, it gives faster algorithms, typically reducing an \(O(n^{\varepsilon })\) factor in the previous bounds to polylogarithmic. In addition, we give here two new applications: an efficient construction of a spanner in a disk intersection graph, and a data structure for efficient connectivity queries in a dynamic disk graph. To obtain this data structure, we combine and extend various techniques from the literature. Along the way, we obtain several side results that are of independent interest. Our data structure depends on the existence and an efficient construction of “vertical” shallow cuttings in arrangements of bivariate algebraic functions. We prove that an appropriate level in an arrangement of a random sample of a suitable size provides such a cutting. To compute it efficiently, we develop a randomized incremental construction algorithm for computing the lowest k levels in an arrangement of bivariate algebraic functions (we mostly consider here collections of functions whose lower envelope has linear complexity, as is the case in the dynamic nearest-neighbor context, under both types of norm). To analyze this algorithm, we also improve a longstanding bound on the combinatorial complexity of the vertical decomposition of these levels. Finally, to obtain our structure, we combine our vertical shallow cutting construction with Chan’s algorithm for efficiently maintaining the lower envelope of a dynamic set of planes in \({{\mathbb {R}}}^3\). Along the way, we also revisit Chan’s technique and present a variant that uses a single binary counter, with a simpler analysis and improved amortized deletion time (by a logarithmic factor; the insertion and query costs remain asymptotically the same).","Haim Kaplan1, Wolfgang Mulzer

","
In Arakelov theory a completion of an arithmetic surface is
achieved by enlarging the group of divisors by formal linear
combinations of the “closed fibers at infinity”. Manin described
the dual graph of any such closed fiber in terms of an infinite
tangle of bounded geodesics in a hyperbolic handlebody endowed
with a Schottky uniformization. In this paper we consider
arithmetic surfaces over the ring of integers in a number field,
with fibers of genus 
g ≥ 2. 
We use Connes’ theory of spectral
triples to relate the hyperbolic geometry of the handlebody to
Deninger’s archimedean  cohomology and the cohomology of the cone
of the local monodromy 
N at arithmetic infinity as introduced by
the first author of this paper. First, we consider derived (cohomological)
spectral data 
\(A, H^{\cdot}(X^*), \Phi\),
where the algebra
is obtained from the SL
(2, ℝ) action on the cohomology of the cone, induced by the
presence of a polarized Lefschetz module structure, and its
restriction to the group ring of a Fuchsian Schottky group. In this
setting we recover the alternating product of the archimedean
factors from a zeta function of a spectral triple. Then, we
introduce a different construction, which is related to Manin’s
description of the dual graph of the fiber at infinity. We provide a
geometric model for the dual graph as the mapping torus of a dynamical
system T on a Cantor set. 
We consider a noncommutative space which
describes the action of the Schottky group on its limit set and
parameterizes the ‘‘components of the closed fiber at infinity’’.
This can be identified with a Cuntz-Krieger algebra 
\({\mathcal O}_A\)
associated to a subshift of finite type. We construct a spectral
triple for this noncommutative space, via a representation on the
cochains of a ‘‘dynamical cohomology’’, defined in terms
of the tangle of bounded geodesics in the handlebody. In both
constructions presented in the paper, the Dirac operator agrees with
the grading operator Φ that represents the ‘‘logarithm of a
Frobenius-type operator’’ on the archimedean  cohomology. In fact,
the archimedean  cohomology embeds in the dynamical
cohomology, compatibly with the action of a real Frobenius 
\(\bar F_\infty,\)
so that the local factor can again be recovered from these
data. The duality isomorphism on the cohomology of the cone of 
N
corresponds to the pairing of dynamical homology and cohomology. 
This suggests the existence of a duality between the monodromy 
N and the
dynamical map 1-T. 
Moreover, the ‘‘reduction mod infinity’’ is
described in terms of the homotopy quotient associated to the
noncommutative space 
\({\mathcal O}_A\)
 and the μ-map of
Baum-Connes. The geometric model of the dual graph can also be
described as a homotopy quotient.

Those systems possess the property that their input-output product time-integral, which is a measure of the total enerty, is nonnegative. Such a property can be also formulated in the discrete context. It is shown that a discrete positive real transfer function is obtained from a positive real continuous one of relative order zero being strictly stable poles via discretization by a sampler and zero-order hold device provided that the direct input-output transmission gain is sufficiently large. It is also proved that a discrete positive real transfer function may be obtained from a stable continuous one of relative order zero and high direct input-output gain which posses simple complex conjugate critically stable poles even in the case that this one is not positive real. For that purpose, the use of an appropriate phase-lag or phase lead compensating network for the continuous transfer function may be required to ensure positive realness of the discrete transfer function.",M.

Owing to this ordering relation being a partial ordering, the solution concepts proposed in this paper will follow from the similar solution concept, called Pareto optimal solution, in the conventional multiobjective programming problems.

These have been applied in two ways mainly: through the construction of a unique metamodel that is used as the objective function inside the optimization algorithm; or through the sequential metamodel, construction used to assist the domain exploration and exploitation during the optimization process. The multiquadric and Gaussian radial basis functions contain a shape parameter, which affects the metamodel accuracy and the convergence of the metamodels based optimization algorithms. The use of a simple and efficient algorithm to automatically adjust the shape parameter inside these algorithms is proposed in the present article to increase the robustness of sequential metamodel assisted optimization algorithms. The technique is applied in the context of a specific algorithm of such kind for which the shape parameter adjustment was not apparently investigated yet. Comparative numerical results for benchmark functions and a real engineering problem about blade cascade design optimization are presented and discussed. The results attest that the proposed technique can produce optimization process accelerations comparable to those obtained using fixed shape parameters previously optimized.","Nelson José Diaz Gautier1,2, Edna Raimunda da Silva1, Nelson Manzanares-Filho1 & …Ramiro Gustavo Ramírez Camacho",Optimization and Engineering,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-021-09692-2,"Sequential metamodeling,Optimization,Shape parameter,Radial basis function,Blade cascade"
2296,Formal foundations for the origins of human consciousness,"In the framework of p-adic analysis (the simplest version of analysis on trees in which hierarchic structures are presented through ultrametric distance) applied to formalize psychic phenomena, we would like to propose some possible first hypotheses about the origins of human consciousness centered on the basic notion of time symmetry breaking as meant according to quantum field theory of infinite systems. Starting with Freud’s psychophysical (hydraulic) model of unconscious and conscious flows of psychic energy based on the three-orders mental representation, the emotional order, the thing representation order, and the word representation order, we use the p-adic (treelike) mental spaces to model transition from unconsciousness to preconsciousness and then to consciousness. Here we explore theory of hysteresis dynamics: conscious states are generated as the result of integrating of unconscious memories. One of the main mathematical consequences of our model is that trees representing unconscious and consciousmental states have to have different structures of branching and distinct procedures of clustering. The psychophysical model of Freud in combination with the p-adic mathematical representation gives us a possibility to apply (for a moment just formally) the theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking of infinite dimensional field theory, to mental processes and, in particular, to make the first step towards modeling of interrelation between the physical time (at the level of the emotional order) and psychic time at the levels of the thing and word representations. Finally, we also discuss some related topological aspects of the human unconscious, following Jacques Lacan’s psychoanalytic concepts.","G. Iurato1, A. Khrennikov2 & F.

2300,A new model for calculating the maximum trust in Online Social Networks and solving by Artificial Bee Colony algorithm,"The social networks are widely used by millions of people worldwide. The trust concept is one of the most important issues in Social Network Analysis (SNA) which highly affects the quantity and quality of the inter-connections, decisions, and interactions among the users in e-commerce or recommendation systems. Many normative algorithms are developed to calculate the trust which most of them are complicated, depend on the network structure, and need lots of critical information that makes them hard to use. The aim of this paper is proposing a descriptive, simple and effective method for calculating the maximal trust and the trust route between any two users of an Online Social Network (OSN). For this purpose, four new models for estimating the trust mechanism of the users are proposed and analyzed using Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Anderson–Darling statistical hypothesis tests to identify and validate the best-fitted model based on 20,613 empirical results gathered from 4552 social network volunteers. Due to the time–complexity of the problem, a meta-heuristic algorithm based on the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization method is also developed for solving the best-fitted model. The proposed algorithm is simulated in Matlab® over six larger test cases adopted from the Facebook dataset. In order to evaluate the performance of the developed algorithm, the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) based meta-heuristics are also simulated on the same test cases.

The results are classified in several groups according to the technique dealt with. The used techniques include both Lyapunov's matrix inequalities and equalities and Gerschgorin's circle theorem. The Lyapunov's inequalities are guaranteed if a set of matrices, built from the matrices of undelayed and delayed dynamics, are stability matrices.

2306,Adaptive Precision Floating-Point Arithmetic and Fast Robust Geometric Predicates ," Exact computer arithmetic has a variety of uses, including the robust implementation of geometric algorithms. This article has three purposes. The first is to offer fast software-level algorithms for exact addition and multiplication of arbitrary precision floating-point values. The second is to propose a technique for adaptive precision arithmetic that can often speed these algorithms when they are used to perform multiprecision calculations that do not always require exact arithmetic, but must satisfy some error bound. The third is to use these techniques to develop implementations of several common geometric calculations whose required degree of accuracy depends on their inputs. These robust geometric predicates are adaptive; their running time depends on the degree of uncertainty of the result, and is usually small. These algorithms work on computers whose floating-point arithmetic uses radix two and exact rounding, including machines complying with the IEEE 754 standard. The inputs to the predicates may be arbitrary single or double precision floating-point numbers. C code is publicly available for the two-dimensional and three-dimensional orientation and incircle tests, and robust Delaunay triangulation using these tests. Timings of the implementations demonstrate their effectiveness.",Jonathan Richard Shewchuk,Discrete & Computational Geometry,1997,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00009321,"Delaunay Triangulation,Exact Computer,Double Precision,Geometric Calculation,Computer Arithmetic"
2307,On the unique continuation problem for CR mappings into nonminimal hypersurfaces,"We prove the following results on the unique continuation problem for CR mappings between real smooth hypersurfaces in ℂn. If the CR mappingH extends holomorphically to one side of the source manifoldM near the pointp
0 εM, the target manifoldM′ contains a holomorphic hypersurface σ′ throughp′0 =H(p
0 (i.e.,M′ is nonminimal atp′
0), andH(M) ⊄ Σ′ (forcingM to be nonminimal atp
0), then the transversal component ofH is not flat atp
0. Furthermore, we show that the assumption thatH extends holomorphically to one side ofM cannot be removed in general. Indeed, we give an example of a smooth CR mappingH, withM, M′ ⊂ ℂ2, real analytic and of infinite type atp
0 andp′0 respectively (without being Levi flat), such thatH(M) ⊄ Σ′ but the transversal component ofH is flat atp
0 (in particular,H is not real analytic!). However, we show that ifM andM′ are assumed to be real analytic, and if the sourceM is “sufficiently far from being Levi flat” in a certain sense (so as to exclude the above mentioned counterexample) then the assumption thatH extends holomorphically to one side ofM can be dropped. Also, in the general case, we prove that the rate of vanishing of the transversal component cannot be too rapid (unlessH(M) ⊂ Σ′), and we relate the possible rate of vanishing to the order of vanishing of the Levi form on a certain holomorphic submanifold ofM.",Peter Ebenfelt1 nAff,The Journal of Geometric Analysis,1996,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02921657,"32C16,32H02,58C10"

2310,Pseudo expected improvement criterion for parallel EGO algorithm,"The efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm is famous for its high efficiency in solving computationally expensive optimization problems. However, the expected improvement (EI) criterion used for picking up candidate points in the EGO process produces only one design point per optimization cycle, which is time-wasting when parallel computing can be used. In this work, a new criterion called pseudo expected improvement (PEI) is proposed for developing parallel EGO algorithms. In each cycle, the first updating point is selected by the initial EI function. After that, the PEI function is built to approximate the real updated EI function by multiplying the initial EI function by an influence function of the updating point. The influence function is designed to simulate the impact that the updating point will have on the EI function, and is only corresponding to the position of the updating point (not the function value of the updating point). Therefore, the next updating point can be identified by maximizing the PEI function without evaluating the first updating point. As the sequential process goes on, a desired number of updating points can be selected by the PEI criterion within one optimization cycle. The efficiency of the proposed PEI criterion is validated by six benchmarks with dimension from 2 to 6. The results show that the proposed PEI algorithm performs significantly better than the standard EGO algorithm, and gains significant improvements over five of the six test problems compared against a state-of-the-art parallel EGO algorithm. Furthermore, additional experiments show that it affects the convergence of the proposed algorithm significantly when the global maximum of the PEI function is not found. It is recommended to use as much evaluations as one can afford to find the global maximum of the PEI function.","Dawei Zhan1, Jiachang Qian1 & Yuansheng Cheng",Journal of Global Optimization,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-016-0484-7,"Efficient global optimization,Expected improvement,Parallel computing,Pseudo expected improvement,Influence function"

The algebraic approach is proved almost always to give inclusion-maximal inner interval estimates of the solutionsets considered.

2314,A stochastic analysis of first-order reaction networks,"A stochastic model for a general system of first-order reactions in which each reaction may be either a conversion reaction or a catalytic reaction is derived. The governing master equation is formulated in a manner that explicitly separates the effects of network topology from other aspects, and the evolution equations for the first two moments are derived. We find the surprising, and apparently unknown, result that the time evolution of the second moments can be represented explicitly in terms of the eigenvalues and projections of the matrix that governs the evolution of the means. The model is used to analyze the effects of network topology and the reaction type on the moments of the probability distribution. In particular, it is shown that for an open system of first-order conversion reactions, the distribution of all the system components is a Poisson distribution at steady state. Two different measures of the noise have been used previously, and it is shown that different qualitative and quantitative conclusions can result, depending on which measure is used. The effect of catalytic reactions on the variance of the system components is also analyzed, and the master equation for a coupled system of first-order reactions and diffusion is derived.","Chetan Gadgil1, Chang Hyeong Lee1 & Hans G.

The numerical solution is obtained by using at any step an approximation of the matrix exponential, e.g. a polynomial or a rational approximation. We study the long-time behavior of \(\gamma _n\) by comparing it to the relative error \(\gamma _n^{\mathrm{long}}\) in the numerical integration of the long-time solution, i.e. the projection of the solution on the eigenspace of the rightmost eigenvalues. The error \( \gamma _n^{\mathrm{long}}\) grows linearly in time, it is small and it remains small in the long-time. We give a condition under which \(\gamma _n\approx \gamma _n^{\mathrm{long}}\), i.e. \(\frac{\gamma _n}{\gamma _n^{\mathrm{long}}}\approx 1\), in the long-time. When this condition does not hold, the ratio \(\frac{\gamma _n}{\gamma _n^{\mathrm{long}}}\) is large for all time. These results describe the long-time behavior of the relative error \(\gamma _n\) in the stiff situation.",S.

2321,Homogeneous spaces with inner metric and with integrable invariant distributions,"This paper is a survey of results (partly obtained by the authors) on homogeneous spaces of Lie groups \(G\) with a compact stabilizer subgroup \(H\), on which every \(G\)-invariant distribution is integrable. It is proved that the condition of integrability is necessary and sufficient for every invariant inner metric to be (holonomic) Finsler on such a space. As a corollary of the obtained results, we assert that the class of homogeneous spaces with invariant non-holonomic Riemannian metrics (in other terms, sub-Riemannian or Carnot–Carathéodory metrics), which were actively studied last 3 decades after Gromov’s work, is rather broad. On the other hand, the class of homogeneous spaces with integrable invariant distributions includes Cartan’s symmetric spaces as well as isotropy irreducible, in particular, strictly isotropy irreducible, homogeneous spaces, which have been classified in simply connected case in the papers by Wang and Ziller (respectively, by Manturov, Wolf and Krämer). Special attention is paid to the case, when the Lie groups \(G\) and \(H\) are connected. Then the integrability condition of the invariant distributions is equivalent to a purely algebraic condition, that for the Lie algebra \(h\) of the subgroup \(H\), any \(ad(h)\)-invariant vector subspace in the Lie algebra \(g\) of the Lie group \(G\) is a Lie subalgebra; such Lie subalgebra \(h\subset g\) is called a strong subalgebra. The first author proved that a simply connected and compact space \(G/H\) with this condition is isomorphic to a direct product of strictly isotropy irreducible homogeneous spaces. In line with this, the second author recently found several non-compact simply connected homogeneous spaces with this condition, which are not isomorphic to such direct products. These results are naturally related to the structure questions of a class of general homogeneous locally compact spaces with an inner metric. This class is exactly the closure in the Gromov–Hausdorff sense of the class of homogeneous manifolds with an inner metric. Any such manifold is isometric to some homogeneous manifold \(G/H\) with \(G\)-invariant (may be, non-holonomic) Finsler metric. The authors give fairly detailed survey of the existing methods of the search of geodesics, i.e., locally shortest arcs, on such manifolds (particularly, with invariant non-holonomic Riemannian metrics), non-holonomic metric geometry and its relations with the geometric group theory, \(CR\)-manifolds, thermodynamics, etc. Some unsolved problems are suggested.",V.

2322,The Impact of Population Aging on Housing Demand in China Based on System Dynamics,"In recent years, the proportion of China’s elderly population is gradually increasing, and the real estate market is changing dramatically. Consequently the impact of population aging on housing demand has become increasingly prominent. On the theoretical basis of the relationship between population aging, family structure and housing demand, this paper firstly constructs a system dynamics model of the impact of population aging and family structure on housing demand in China. Then, the model is simulated, and several scenarios of population, family structure, and real estate policies are set up. The main conclusions of this paper are as follows: China’s population will rise at first and then decrease, reaching a peak of 1.401 billion by 2023. As the proportion of elderly population increases, the degree of population aging is becoming increasingly serious. The size of the family will gradually shrink to 2.39 people per household in 2050. The housing demand will increase first and then decrease. Through the results of scenario simulation, this paper puts forward the following suggestion to effectively balance the housing demand in China: Completely relaxing family planning policies, imposing a real estate tax, canceling the pre-sale policy, and raising the loan rate.","Xindi Mou1, Xiuting Li2 & Jichang Dong",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-020-9114-z,"Family structure,housing demand,population aging,system dynamics"

We investigate inverse iteration, Rayleigh quotient iteration, residual inverse iteration, and the single-vector Jacobi–Davidson method, analyzing the impact of the tolerances chosen for the approximate solution of the linear systems arising in these algorithms on the order of the local convergence rates. We show that the inexact algorithms can achieve the same order of convergence as the exact methods if appropriate sequences of tolerances are applied to the inner solves. We discuss the connections and emphasize the differences between the standard inexact Newton’s method and these inexact algorithms.

2325,"Spectrum of the Koopman Operator, Spectral Expansions in Functional Spaces, and State-Space Geometry","We examine spectral operator-theoretic properties of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems with globally stable attractors. Using the Kato decomposition, we develop a spectral expansion for general linear autonomous dynamical systems with analytic observables and define the notion of generalized eigenfunctions of the associated Koopman operator. We interpret stable, unstable and center subspaces in terms of zero-level sets of generalized eigenfunctions. We then utilize conjugacy properties of Koopman eigenfunctions and the new notion of open eigenfunctions—defined on subsets of state space—to extend these results to nonlinear dynamical systems with an equilibrium. We provide a characterization of (global) center manifolds, center-stable, and center-unstable manifolds in terms of joint zero-level sets of families of Koopman operator eigenfunctions associated with the nonlinear system. After defining a new class of Hilbert spaces, that capture the on- and off-attractor properties of dissipative dynamics, and introducing the concept of modulated Fock spaces, we develop spectral expansions for a class of dynamical systems possessing globally stable limit cycles and limit tori, with observables that are square-integrable in on-attractor variables and analytic in off-attractor variables. We discuss definitions of stable, unstable, and global center manifolds in such nonlinear systems with (quasi)-periodic attractors in terms of zero-level sets of Koopman operator eigenfunctions. We define the notion of isostables for a general class of nonlinear systems. In contrast with the systems that have discrete Koopman operator spectrum, we provide a simple example of a measure-preserving system that is not chaotic but has continuous spectrum, and discuss experimental observations of spectrum on such systems. We also provide a brief characterization of the data types corresponding to the obtained theoretical results and define the coherent principal dimension for a class of datasets based on the lattice-type principal spectrum of the associated Koopman operator.","Igor Mezić

These pulses are known to be nonlinearly stable with respect to the underlying PDE. Recently, the existence of fast pulses with oscillatory tails was proved for the FitzHugh–Nagumo equations. In this paper, we prove that the fast pulses with oscillatory tails are also nonlinearly stable. Similar to the case of monotone tails, stability is decided by the location of a nontrivial eigenvalue near the origin of the PDE linearization about the traveling pulse. We prove that this real eigenvalue is always negative. However, the expression that governs the sign of this eigenvalue for oscillatory pulses differs from that for monotone pulses, and we show indeed that the nontrivial eigenvalue in the monotone case scales with \(\varepsilon \), while the relevant scaling in the oscillatory case is \(\varepsilon ^{2/3}\).","Paul Carter1, Björn de Rijk2 & Björn Sandstede",Journal of Nonlinear Science,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00332-016-9308-7,"FitzHugh-Nagumo system,traveling pulses,spectral stability,geometric singular perturbation theory,Lin’s method"

These methods clearly demonstrate that details of complex function theory which are normally employed in handling such integral equations for their solutions can be avoided altogether. Also, some approximate methods of solution of such integral equations are developed.ResultsThe solutions of real singular integral equations over different intervals such as (−1,1); (a, b); (0, a) ∪ (b, c); (−1, k) ∪ (k, 1); (−∞, b); (a, + ∞); (−∞, + ∞); infinite intervals with a gap are obtained by using the proposed methods.ConclusionThe proposed methods are new and each has its own structure.",Aloknath Chakrabarti1 & Subash Chandra Martha,Mathematical Sciences,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2251-7456-6-15,"Real singular integral equations,Cauchy-type kernels,Real variable method,MSC,45E05"

These difficulties may concern the exponential execution time, the effectiveness of the mutation and recombination operators or finding the tradeoff between diversity and convergence. In this paper, the issue of 3D redeploying in indoor the connected objects (or nodes) in the Internet of Things collection networks (formerly known as wireless sensor nodes) is investigated. The aim is to determine the ideal locations of the objects to be added to enhance an initial deployment while satisfying antagonist objectives and constraints. In this regard, a first proposed contribution aim to introduce an hybrid model that includes many-objective optimization algorithms relying on decomposition (MOEA/D, MOEA/DD) and reference points (Two_Arch2, NSGA-III) while using two strategies for introducing the preferences (PI-EMO-PC) and the dimensionality reduction (MVU-PCA). This hybridization aims to combine the algorithms advantages for resolving the many-objective issues. The second contribution concerns prototyping and deploying real connected objects which allows assessing the performance of the proposed hybrid scheme on a real world environment. The obtained experimental and numerical results show the efficiency of the suggested hybridization scheme against the original algorithms.","Sami Mnasri

2339,Numerical solving of equations in the work of José Mariano Vallejo,"The progress of Mathematics during the nineteenth century was characterised both by an enormous acquisition of new knowledge and by the attempts to introduce rigour in reasoning patterns and mathematical writing. Cauchy’s presentation of Mathematical Analysis was not immediately accepted, and many writers, though aware of that new style, did not use it in their own mathematical production. This paper is devoted to an episode of this sort that took place in Spain during the first half of the century: It deals with the presentation of a method for numerically solving algebraic equations by José Mariano Vallejo, a late Spanish follower of the Enlightenment ideas, politician, writer, and mathematician who published it in the fourth (1840) edition of his book Compendio de Matemáticas Puras y Mistas, claiming to have discovered it on his own. Vallejo’s main achievement was to write down the whole procedure in a very careful way taking into account the different types of roots, although he paid little attention to questions such as convergence checks and the fulfilment of the hypotheses of Rolle’s Theorem. For sure this lack of mathematical care prevented Vallejo to occupy a place among the forerunners of Computational Algebra.","José-Miguel Pacheco Castelao1, F.

We establish global existence of solutions and study their qualitative behaviour. We study the effect of telomere restoration on cancer cell dynamics. Our results indicate that without telomere restoration, the cell population extinguishes. With telomere restoration, exponential growth occurs in the linear model. We further characterise the specific growth behaviour of the cell population for special cases. We also study the effects of crowding induced mortality on the qualitative behaviour, and the existence and stability of steady states of a nonlinear model incorporating crowding effect.

2343,FFTs on the Rotation Group,"We discuss an implementation of an efficient algorithm for the numerical computation of Fourier transforms of bandlimited functions defined on the rotation group SO(3). The implementation is freely available on the web. The algorithm described herein uses O(B

3)) spherical harmonics of degree at most B. This compares very favorably with the direct O(B
6) algorithm derived from a basic quadrature rule on O(B

Deterministic and stochastic approaches as well as hybridizations between these two search techniques are considered. More precisely, we consider two-stage strategies where the optimum localization is performed by a genetic algorithm, while a gradient-based method is used to terminate the optimization process. Also, another type of hybridization strategy is investigated where a partially converged gradient-based method is incorporated in the genetic algorithm as a new operator. A detailed discussion is made and various different solutions are critically compared.The proposed methodology is consistent and capable of giving fundamental information to the designer for further investigating towards the directions identified by the procedure.A basic example is described, and the use of the methodology to establish the effects of different geometrical and technological parameters is discussed.","Giovanni Lombardi1, Giovanni Mengali1 & Francois Beux",Optimization and Engineering,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-006-6837-1,"Aircraft optimization,Hybrid algorithms,Genetic algorithms"

Previously known results are extended so that one can treat the local invasion of an equilibrium of cooperating species by a new species or mutant. It is found that, in general, the resulting change in the equilibrium density of each species spreads at its own asymptotic speed, with the speed of the invader the slowest of the speeds. Conditions on $Q$ are given which insure that all species spread at the same asymptotic speed, and that this speed agrees with the more easily calculated speed of a linearized problem for the invader alone. If this is true we say that the recursion has a single speed and is linearly determinate. The conditions are such that they can be verified for a class of reaction-diffusion models.","Hans F.

2355,Randomized continuous frames in time-frequency analysis,"Recently, a Monte Carlo approach was proposed for processing highly redundant continuous frames. In this paper, we present and analyze applications of this new theory. The computational complexity of the Monte Carlo method relies on the continuous frame being so-called linear volume discretizable (LVD). The LVD property means that the number of samples in the coefficient space required by the Monte Carlo method is proportional to the resolution of the discrete signal. We show in this paper that the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and the localizing time-frequency transform (LTFT) are LVD. The LTFT is a time-frequency representation based on a 3D time-frequency space with a richer class of time-frequency atoms than classical time-frequency transforms like the short time Fourier transform (STFT) and the CWT. Our analysis proves that performing signal processing with the LTFT has the same asymptotic complexity as signal processing with the STFT and CWT (based on FFT), even though the coefficient space of the LTFT is higher dimensional.","Ron Levie

2357,Nonlinear dynamic analysis of moving bilayer plates resting on elastic foundations,"The aim of this study is to investigate the dynamic response of axially moving two-layer laminated plates on the Winkler and Pasternak foundations. The upper and lower layers are formed from a bidirectional functionally graded (FG) layer and a graphene platelet (GPL) reinforced porous layer, respectively. Henceforth, the combined layers will be referred to as a two-dimensional (2D) FG/GPL plate. Two types of porosity and three graphene dispersion patterns, each of which is distributed through the plate thickness, are investigated. The mechanical properties of the closed-cell layers are used to define the variation of Poisson’s ratio and the relationship between the porosity coefficients and the mass density. For the GPL reinforced layer, the effective Young’s modulus is derived with the Halpin-Tsai micro-system model, and the rule of mixtures is used to calculate the effective mass density and Poisson’s ratio. The material of the upper 2D-FG layer is graded in two directions, and its effective mechanical properties are also derived with the rule of mixtures. The dynamic governing equations are derived with a first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and the von Kármán nonlinear theory. A combination of the dynamic relaxation (DR) and Newmark’s direct integration methods is used to solve the governing equations in both time and space. A parametric study is carried out to explore the effects of the porosity coefficients, porosity and GPL distributions, material gradients, damping ratios, boundary conditions, and elastic foundation stiffnesses on the plate response. It is shown that both the distributions of the porosity and graphene nanofillers significantly affect the dynamic behaviors of the plates. It is also shown that the reduction in the dynamic deflection of the bilayer composite plates is maximized when the porosity and GPL distributions are symmetric.","M. Esmaeilzadeh1, M.

2358,A Theoretical Analysis of Temporal Difference Learning in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma Game,"Direct reciprocity is a chief mechanism of mutual cooperation in social dilemma. Agents cooperate if future interactions with the same opponents are highly likely. Direct reciprocity has been explored mostly by evolutionary game theory based on natural selection. Our daily experience tells, however, that real social agents including humans learn to cooperate based on experience. In this paper, we analyze a reinforcement learning model called temporal difference learning and study its performance in the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game. Temporal difference learning is unique among a variety of learning models in that it inherently aims at increasing future payoffs, not immediate ones. It also has a neural basis. We analytically and numerically show that learners with only two internal states properly learn to cooperate with retaliatory players and to defect against unconditional cooperators and defectors. Four-state learners are more capable of achieving a high payoff against various opponents. Moreover, we numerically show that four-state learners can learn to establish mutual cooperation for sufficiently small learning rates.",Naoki Masuda1 & Hisashi Ohtsuki,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-009-9424-8,"Cooperation,Direct reciprocity,Prisoner’s dilemma,Reinforcement learning"

We know the distances between these points. We later encounter a similar object B and want to know if it is A. We have a sensor that sends and receives electronic signals, and so we measure the distances \(t_i\) from the sensor to the distinguished points on B. We first consider the two-dimensional case. Assume there are three distinct points on A. We have our measured distances \(t_1, t_2, t_3\) and previously known distances between the points on A, \(d_1, d_2, d_3\). We derive a polynomial system relating these quantities and show that it is easy to solve yielding a resultant that is the “signature” for A. Its use will eliminate B if B is not A. The generalization to three dimensions is immediate. We need a fourth point. The polynomial system contains many parameters, but we solve it symbolically. We then discuss generalizations involving flexibility. In those cases we need five points and the systems are much more complex. In section five we consider the same question of recognition but using a different type of sensor, one that can only receive. We compare a Gröbner basis approach with the Dixon resultant method. We compare solutions on Magma, Maple, and Fermat computer algebra systems.",Robert H.

2360,Analysis of volume regulation in an epithelial cell model,"An epithelial cell is modeled as a single compartment, bounded by apical and basolateral cell membranes, and containing two nonelectrolyte solute species, nominally NaCl and KCl. Membrane transport of these species may be metabolically driven, or it may follow the transmembrane concentration gradients, either singly (a channel) or jointly (a cotransporter). To represent the effect of stretch-activated channels or shrinkage-activated cotransporters, the membrane permeabilities and cotransport coefficients are permitted to be functions of cell volume. When this epithelium is considered as a dynamical system, conditions are indicated which guarantee the uniqueness and stability of equilibria. Experimentally, many epithelial cells can regulate their volume, and such volume regulatory capability is defined for this model. It is clearly distinct from dynamical stability of the equilibrium and requires more stringent conditions on the volume-dependent permeabilities and cotransporters. For a previously developed model of the toad urinary bladder (Strieteret al., 1990,J. gen. Physiol.
96, 319–344) the uniqueness and stability of its equilibria are indicated. The analysis also demonstrates that under some conditions a second stable equilibrium may appear, along with a saddle-node bifurcation.

New features are proposed to orientation of bifurcations and properties stability of bifurcation solutions for problems on basic scenarios of bifurcations. We also propose new algorithms for constructing central manifolds of the corresponding problems, allowing to obtain new bifurcation formulas, in particular, formulas to calculate Lyapunov quantities.

2369,Robust stabilizing compensators for flexible structures with collocated controls,"For flexible structures with collocated rate and attitude sensors/actuators, we characterize compensator transfer functions which guarantee modal stability even when stiffness/inertia parameters are uncertain. While the compensators are finite-dimensional, the structure models are allowed to be infinite-dimensional (continuum models), with attendant complexity of the notion of stability; thus exponential stability is not possible and the best we can obtain is strong stability. Robustness is interpreted essentially as maintaining stability in the worst case. The conditions require that the compensator transfer functions be positive real and use is made of the Kalman-Yakubovic lemma to characterize them further. The concept of positive realness is shown to be equivalent to dissipativity in infinite dimensions. In particular we show that for a subclass of compensators it is possible to make the system strongly stable as well as dissipative in an appropriate energy norm.",A. V.

In this paper, I collect some new and noteworthy insights and developments that have evolved around those problems in the last decade or so. In the course of my tales, I will touch mathematical topics as diverse as divergent series, Ramanujan summation, low-rank approximations of functions, hybrid numeric-symbolic computation, singular moduli, self-avoiding random walks, the Riemann prime counting function, and winding numbers of planar Brownian motion. As was already the intention of the book, I hope to encourage the reader to take a broad view of mathematics, since one lasting moral of Trefethen’s contest is that overspecialization will provide too narrow a view for one with a serious interest in computation.",Folkmar Bornemann,Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s13291-016-0137-2,"Divergent series,Numeric-symbolic methods,Low-rank approximation,Singular moduli,Self-avoiding random walk,Riemann \(R\) function"

The fixed-point set of the involution on the manifold is a Lagrangian submanifold. We investigate its image under the moment map and conclude that the intersection with the Weyl chamber is an easily described subpolytope of the Kirwan polytope. Of special interest is the integral Kähler case, where much stronger results hold. In particular, we obtain convexity theorems for closures of orbits of the noncompact dual group (in the sense of the theory of symmetric pairs).

We study certain one parameter deformations of this metric on the complement of an arrangement (= finite union of hyperplanes) whose Levi-Civita connection is of Dunkl type. Interesting examples are obtained from the arrangements defined by finite complex reflection groups. We determine a parameter interval for which the metric is locally of Fubini-Study type, flat, or complex-hyperbolic. We find a finite subset of this interval for which we get a complete orbifold or at least a Zariski open subset thereof, and we analyze these cases in some detail (e.g., we determine their orbifold fundamental group).In this set-up, the principal results of Deligne-Mostow on the Lauricella hypergeometric differential equation and work of Barthel-Hirzebruch-Höfer on arrangements in a projective plane appear as special cases. Along the way we produce in a geometric manner all the pairs of complex reflection groups with isomorphic discriminants, thus providing a uniform approach to work of Orlik-Solomon.

The U(1) symmetry implies the existence of a continuity equation for the particle density ρ≡|ψ|2 where the current j

ψ
 has, in general, a nonlinear structure. We introduce a nonlinear gauge transformation on the dependent variables ρ and j

ψ
 which changes the evolution equation in another one containing only a real nonlinearity and transforms the particle current j

 in the standard bilinear form. We extend the method to U(1)-invariant coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations where the most general nonlinearity is taken into account through the sum of an Hermitian matrix and an anti-Hermitian matrix. By means of the nonlinear gauge transformation we change the nonlinear system in another one containing only a purely Hermitian nonlinearity. Finally, we consider nonlinear Schrödinger equations minimally coupled with an Abelian gauge field whose dynamics is governed, in the most general fashion, through the Maxwell-Chern-Simons equation. It is shown that the nonlinear transformation we are introducing can be applied, in this case, separately to the gauge field or to the matter field with the same final result. In conclusion, some relevant examples are presented to show the applicability of the method.",Antonio M.

2375,Analysis of periodic linear systems over finite fields with and without Floquet Transform,"This paper develops the analysis of discrete-time periodically time-varying linear systems over finite fields. It is shown that the conditions for the existence of Floquet Transform for periodic linear systems over reals (or complex) do not carry forward for this case over finite fields. The existence of Floquet Transform is shown to be equivalent to the existence of an Nth root of the monodromy matrix for the class of non-singular periodic linear systems. As the verification of existence and computation of the Nth root is a computationally hard problem, an independent analysis of the solutions of such systems is carried without the use of Floquet Transform. It is proved that all initial conditions of such systems lie either in a periodic orbit or a chain leading to a periodic orbit. A subspace of the state space is also identified, containing all initial conditions lying on a periodic orbit. Further, whenever the Floquet Transform exists, more concrete results on the orbit lengths are established depending on the coprimeness of the orbit length with the system period.","Ramachandran Anantharaman1 & Virendra Sule

2376,Overcompensatory recruitment and generation delay in discrete age-structured population models," The effect of overcompensatory recruitment and the combined effect of overcompensatory recruitment and generation delay in discrete nonlinear age-structured population models is studied. Considering overcompensatory recruitment alone, we present formal proofs of the supercritical nature of bifurcations (both flip and Hopf) as well as an extensive analysis of dynamics in unstable parameter regions. One important finding here is that in case of small and moderate year to year survival probabilities there are large regions in parameter space where the qualitative behaviour found in a general n+1 dimensional model is retained already in a one-dimensional model. Another result is that the dynamics at or near the boundary of parameter space may be very complicated. Generally, generation delay is found to act as a destabilizing effect but its effect on dynamics is by no means unique. The most profound effect occurs in the n-generation delay cases. In these cases there is no stable equilibrium X
* at all, but whenever X
* small, a stable cycle of period n+1 where the periodic points in the cycle are on a very special form.

2380,Nonresonant bilinear forms for partially dissipative hyperbolic systems violating the Shizuta–Kawashima condition,"In the context of hyperbolic systems of balance laws, the Shizuta–Kawashima coupling condition guarantees that all the variables of the system are dissipative even though the system is not totally dissipative. Hence it plays a crucial role in terms of sufficient conditions for the global in time existence of classical solutions. However, it is easy to find physically based models that do not satisfy this condition, especially in several space dimensions. In this paper, we consider two simple examples of partially dissipative hyperbolic systems violating the Shizuta–Kawashima condition (SK) in 3D, such that some eigendirections do not exhibit dissipation at all. We prove that if the source term is nonresonant (in a suitable sense) in the direction where dissipation does not play any role, then the formation of singularities is prevented, despite the lack of dissipation, and the smooth solutions exist globally in time. The main idea of the proof is to couple Green function estimates for weakly dissipative hyperbolic systems with the space–time resonance analysis for dispersive equations introduced by Germain, Masmoudi and Shatah. More precisely, the partially dissipative hyperbolic systems violating (SK) are endowed, in the nondissipative directions, with a special structure of the nonlinearity, the so-called nonresonant bilinear form for the wave equation (see Pusateri and Shatah, CPAM 2013).","Roberta Bianchini

2383,Calculating Characteristic Roots of Multi-Delayed Systems with Accumulation Points via a Definite Integral Method,"Multi-delayed systems, especially the neutral ones, have infinitely many and complex distributed characteristic roots that are crucial for system dynamics. The definite integral method, which determines the system stability by using only a definite integral, is extended in this paper for calculating all the characteristic roots in an arbitrarily given area on the complex plane of both retarded and neutral multi-delayed systems with constant discrete delays. Two simple algorithms are proposed for implementing the proposed method, by first calculating the distribution of the real parts of all the characteristic roots, then the imaginary parts by using an iteration method. The real part distribution can be used for the quick estimation of key characteristic roots such as the rightmost ones or the corresponding accumulation point(s), thus allowing adjusting the upper limit of the integral to further simplify the calculation procedure. Examples are given to show the feasibility and the efficiency of the proposed method through numerical analyses.","Qi Xu1,2, Zaihua Wang3 & Li Cheng

The theorems generalize five theorems by Nagaev (Litov Mat Sb 8:553–579, 1968) on stretched exponential laws \(p(k) = c\exp ( -k^\alpha )\) and apply to logarithmic hazard functions \(c\exp ( - (\log k)^\beta )\), \(\beta >2\); they cover the big-jump domain as well as the small steps domain. The analytic proof is complemented by clear probabilistic heuristics. Critical sequences are determined with a non-convex variational problem.","Nicholas M. Ercolani1, Sabine Jansen

2388,"An applied mathematical excursion through Lyapunov inequalities, classical analysis and Differential Equations","Several different problems make the study of the so called Lyapunov type inequalities of great interest, both in pure and applied mathematics. Although the original historical motivation was the study of the stability properties of the Hill equation (which applies to many problems in physics and engineering), other questions that arise in systems at resonance, crystallography, isoperimetric problems, Rayleigh type quotients, etc. lead to the study of L
p Lyapunov inequalities (1 ≤ p ≤ Ω) for differential equations. In this work we review some recent results on these kinds of questions which can be formulated as optimal control problems. In the case of Ordinary Differential Equations, we consider periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions at higher eigenvalues. Then, we establish Lyapunov inequalities for systems of equations. For Partial Differential Equations on a domain Ω ⊂ ℝN, we consider the Laplace equation with Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions. It is proved that the relation between the quantities p and N/2 plays a crucial role in order to obtain nontrivial L
p Lyapunov type inequalities (which are called Sobolev inequalities by many authors). One of the main applications of Lyapunov inequalities is its use in the study of nonlinear resonant problems. To this respect, combining the linear results with Schauder fixed point theorem, we show some new results about the existence and uniqueness of solutions for resonant nonlinear problems for ODE or PDE, both in the scalar case and in the case of systems of equations.",Antonio Cañada1 & Salvador Villegas,SeMA Journal,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03322601,"Lyapunov inequalities,boundary value problems,resonance,stability,ordinary differential equations,partial differential equations"
2389,On Using the Shell Theory in Stability Analysis of Fluid Flows in Compliant Pipes,"AbstractThe linear stability of the Poiseuille flow in a compliant pipe of circular cross-section is numerically analyzed using two different wall models based on the theory of thin shells. Small vibrations of the pipe wall are described by general Love’s equations in one model and by simplified Love’s equations derived using the well-known Donnell–Mushtari–Vlasov approximation in the other model. It is shown that the replacement of the general equations by the simplified ones does not qualitatively change the dependence of the basic flow stability characteristics on the wall stiffness and damping. Nevertheless, for some parameter values of the problem under consideration, this replacement can lead to the emergence of weakly growing disturbances, which are not observed in the case of general Love’s equations and are suppressed significantly by increasing wall the stiffness or damping.",K.

By using our own approaches we investigate such properties as uniform convergence of the eigenfunction expansions, the Parseval equality, the Rayleigh-Ritz formula, the minimax principle, and the monotonicity of eigenvalues for the considered boundary value-transmission problem (BVTP).","Kadriye Aydemir1 & Oktay S Mukhtarov2,",Boundary Value Problems,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13661-016-0589-4,"Sturm-Liouville problems,boundary-transmission conditions,eigenvalues,Fourier series of eigenfunctions,minimax principle"
2391,Stability and bifurcation analysis in a viral infection model with delays,"In this paper, a class of virus infection models with CTLs response is considered. We incorporate an immune delay and two intracellular delays into the virus infection model. It is found that only incorporating two intracellular delays almost does not change the dynamics of the system, but incorporating an immune delay changes the dynamics of the system very greatly, namely, a Hopf bifurcation and oscillations can appear. Those results show immune delay dominates intracellular delays in some viral infection models, which indicates the human immune system has a special effect in virus infection models with CTLs response, and the human immune system itself is very complicated. In fact, people are aware of the complexity of the human immune system in medical science, which coincides with our investigating. We also investigate the global Hopf bifurcation of the system with the immune delay as a bifurcation parameter.","Xinguo Sun1,2 & Junjie Wei",Advances in Difference Equations,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13662-015-0664-7,"virus infection model,CTLs response,time delay,Lyapunov functionals,global stability,Hopf bifurcation,global Hopf branch"

2394,Time-continuous and time-discrete SIR models revisited: theory and applications,"Since Kermack and McKendrick have introduced their famous epidemiological SIR model in 1927, mathematical epidemiology has grown as an interdisciplinary research discipline including knowledge from biology, computer science, or mathematics. Due to current threatening epidemics such as COVID-19, this interest is continuously rising. As our main goal, we establish an implicit time-discrete SIR (susceptible people–infectious people–recovered people) model. For this purpose, we first introduce its continuous variant with time-varying transmission and recovery rates and, as our first contribution, discuss thoroughly its properties. With respect to these results, we develop different possible time-discrete SIR models, we derive our implicit time-discrete SIR model in contrast to many other works which mainly investigate explicit time-discrete schemes and, as our main contribution, show unique solvability and further desirable properties compared to its continuous version. We thoroughly show that many of the desired properties of the time-continuous case are still valid in the time-discrete implicit case. Especially, we prove an upper error bound for our time-discrete implicit numerical scheme. Finally, we apply our proposed time-discrete SIR model to currently available data regarding the spread of COVID-19 in Germany and Iran.","Benjamin Wacker

The focus is the analysis of the energy transfer between the two equations, particularly when the first one stands in the supercritical regime, and exhibits an antidissipative character. The principal actor becomes then the coupling constant \(\eta \), ruling the competition between the Fourier damping and the MGT antidamping. Indeed, we will show that a sufficiently large \(\eta \) is always able to stabilize the system exponentially fast. One of the features of this model is the presence of the bilaplacian in the first equation. With respect to the analogous model with the Laplacian, this introduces some differences in the mathematical approach. From the one side, the energy estimate method does not seem to apply in a direct way, from the other side, there is a gain of regularity allowing to rely on analytic semigroup techniques.

2396,Equilibrium Analysis of Channel Structure Strategies in Uncertain Environment,"In this paper, we consider a pricing decision problem with two competing supply chains which distribute differentiated but competing products in the same market. Each chain can be vertically integrated or decentralized based on the choice of the manufacturer. The manufacturing costs, sales costs and consumer demands are characterized as uncertain variables, whose distributions are estimated by experienced experts. Meanwhile, uncertainty theory and game theory are employed to formulate the pricing decision problems. The equilibrium behaviors (how the supply chain members make their own pricing decisions on wholesale prices and retailer markups) at operational level under three possible scenarios are derived. Numerical experiments are also given to explore the impacts of the parameters’ uncertain degrees on supply chain members’ pricing decisions. The results demonstrate that the supply chain uncertain factors have great influences on equilibrium prices. In addition, we also evaluate the effects of competing intensity (substitutability) of the two products on the strategy behaviors, vertically integrated channel strategy versus decentralized strategy, of the manufacturers. It is found that the manufacturers are better off to distribute their products through a decentralized channel rather than an integrated one when the substitutability is greater than some value. Besides, the uncertain factors in the supply chain might reduce the value contrast to the one in deterministic case. Some other interesting managerial highlights are also provided in this paper.","Hu Huang1, Hua Ke1 & Yangyang Che",Journal of Uncertainty Analysis and Applications,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40467-016-0052-1,"Pricing,Two-echelon supply chain,Game theory,Channel structure,Uncertain variable"

Stenzel, we obtain the polarization associated to the adapted complex structure by applying the “imaginary-time geodesic flow” to the vertical polarization.

The main initial-boundary value problem for a third-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation on the entire real axis approximately describes self-similar flow regimes of a viscous incompressible fluid in a mixing layer (a special case is the problem for a flat semi-jet). An associated singular nonlinear boundary value problem on a non-positive real semiaxis is of independent mathematical interest, and its particular solutions admit a well-known physical interpretation (problems for submerged jet, wall jet, etc.). For a substantiated mathematical formulation of these problems and their detailed analysis and numerical solution, the results on singular nonlinear Cauchy problems, smooth stable initial manifolds of solutions, and parametric exponential Lyapunov series, as well as methods of asymptotic analysis, are used.

In this article, the authors introduce five martingale Musielak–Orlicz–Lorentz Hardy spaces and prove that these new spaces have some important features such as atomic characterizations, the boundedness of \(\sigma \)-sublinear operators, and martingale inequalities. This new scale of martingale Hardy spaces requires the introduction of the Musielak–Orlicz–Lorentz space \(L^{\varphi ,q}(\Omega )\). In particular, the authors show that this Lorentz type space has some fundamental properties including the completeness, the convergence, real interpolations, and the Fefferman–Stein vector-valued inequality for the Doob maximal operator. As applications, the authors prove that the maximal Fejér operator is bounded from the martingale Musielak–Orlicz–Lorentz Hardy space \(H_{\varphi ,q}[0,1)\) to \(L^{\varphi ,q}[0,1)\), which further implies some convergence results of the Fejér means. Moreover, all the above results are new even for Musielak–Orlicz functions with particular structure such as weight, weight Orlicz, and double-phase growth. The main approach used in this article can be viewed as a combination of the stopping time argument in probability theory and the real-variable technique of function spaces in harmonic analysis.","Yong Jiao1, Ferenc Weisz2, Guangheng Xie

As the new results, we derive and analyse the adjoint operator, determine the geometric and algebraic multiplicities of the eigenvalues, write down formulae for the eigenfunctions together with the generalised eigenfunctions and study their basis properties.

2409,Convergence rate analysis for the higher order power method in best rank one approximations of tensors,"A popular and classical method for finding the best rank one approximation of a real tensor is the higher order power method (HOPM). It is known in the literature that the iterative sequence generated by HOPM converges globally, while the convergence rate can be superlinear, linear or sublinear. In this paper, we examine the convergence rate of HOPM in solving the best rank one approximation problem of real tensors. We first show that the iterative sequence of HOPM always converges globally and provide an explicit eventual sublinear convergence rate. The sublinear convergence rate estimate is in terms of the dimension and the order of the underlying tensor space. Then, we examine the concept of nondegenerate singular vector tuples and show that, if the sequence of HOPM converges to a nondegenerate singular vector tuple, then the global convergence rate is R-linear. We show that, for almost all tensors (in the sense of Lebesgue measure), all the singular vector tuples are nondegenerate, and so, the HOPM “typically” exhibits global R-linear convergence rate. Moreover, without any regularity assumption, we establish that the sequence generated by HOPM always converges globally and R-linearly for orthogonally decomposable tensors with order at least 3. We achieved this by showing that each nonzero singular vector tuple of an orthogonally decomposable tensor with order at least 3 is nondegenerate.",Shenglong Hu1 & Guoyin Li,Numerische Mathematik,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-018-0981-3,"15A18,15A69,65F18"

For simplicity of presentation, the attention is focused on a group of continuous-time first-order dynamic agents with a time-invariant communication topology in the presence of communication errors. In order to evaluate the robustness of leader-follower consensus, two robustness measures are proposed: the L
2 gain of the error vector to the state of the network and the worst case L
2 gain at a node. Although the L
2 gain of the error vector to the state of the network is widely used in robust control design and analysis, the worst case L
2 gain at a node is less conservative with respect to the number of nodes in the network. It is thus suggested that the worst case L
2 gain at a node is used when the robustness of consensus is considered. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that these two measures are sensitive to the communication topology. In general, the “optimal” communication topology that can achieve most robust performance with respect to either of the proposed robustness measures is difficult to characterize and/or obtain. When the in-degree of each follower is one, it is shown that both measures reach a minimum when the leader can communicate to each node in the network.","Jinzhi Wang1, Ying Tan2 & Iven Mareels",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-009-9156-8,"Communication errors,leader-follower consensus,robustness"

It is our purpose in this paper to show that this new hybrid iterative process converges faster than all of Picard, Krasnoselskii, Mann, Ishikawa, Noor, Picard–Mann and Picard–Krasnoselskii iterative processes in the sense of Berinde (Iterative Approximation of Fixed Points. Efemeride, Baia Mare, 2002). We establish data dependence and stability results for our newly developed iterative process. Moreover, we apply our newly developed iterative process in finding the solution of delay differential equations.","Godwin Amechi Okeke

2413,Analysis of boundary bubbles for almost minimal cylinders,"We analyse the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of the Teichmüller harmonic map flow from cylinders, and more generally of ‘almost minimal cylinders’, in situations where the maps satisfy a Plateau-boundary condition for which the three-point condition degenerates. We prove that such a degenerating boundary condition forces the domain to stretch out as a boundary bubble forms. Our main result then establishes that for prescribed boundary curves that satisfy a separation condition, these boundary bubbles will not only be harmonic but will themselves be branched minimal immersions. Together with earlier work, this in particular completes the proof that the Teichmüller harmonic map flow changes every initial surface in \({{\mathbb {R}}}^n\) spanning such boundary curves into a solution of the corresponding Douglas-Plateau problem.",Melanie Rupflin1 & Matthew R.

2414,Convergence analysis of a new implicit iteration process for asymptotically nonexpansive mappings in the intermediate sense in Banach spaces,"We propose a new implicit iteration process for finding a common element of the sets of solutions of a finite family of non-Lipschitzian asymptotically nonexpansive mapping in the intermediate sense in Banach spaces. Furthermore, we modified Picard-Ishikawa hybrid scheme recently introduced by Okeke (Afr Math 30:817–835, 2019) to its new implicit iterative scheme. Then we used the new implicit iterative scheme to prove the strong convergence theorems, the data dependence and the stability results for asymptotically nonexpansive mappings in the intermediate sense in Banach spaces. Also, we apply the new implicit iterative process in finding the solution of delay differential equation. Moreover, we establish some numerical examples to illustrate our claims. The results presented in this paper extend and improve the result of Okeke (Afr Math 30:817–835, 2019), Saluja (Kragujevac J Math 2:237–249, 2012) and others in the literature.","Godwin Amechi Okeke

2415,Modeling and Dynamics Analysis of Zika Transmission with Limited Medical Resources,"Zika virus, a reemerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, posed a global public health emergency in 2016. Brazil is the most seriously affected country. Some measures have been implemented to control the Zika transmission, such as spraying mosquitoes, developing vaccines and drugs. However, because of the limited medical resources (LMRs) in the country, not every infected patient can be treated in time when infected with Zika virus. We aim to build a deterministic Zika model by introducing a piecewise smooth treatment recovery rate to research the effect of LMRs on the transmission and control of Zika. For the model without treatment, we analyze the global stability of equilibria. For the model with treatment, the model exhibits complex dynamics. We prove that the model with treatment undergoes backward bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation and Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation of codimension 2. It means that the model with LMRs is sensitive to parameters and initial conditions, which has important significance for control of Zika. We also apply the model to estimate the basic and control reproduction numbers for the Zika transmission by using the data on weekly reported accumulated Zika cases from March 25, 2016, to April 14, 2018, in Brazil.

The equation, defined on a semi-infinite interval 0 < r < ∞, possesses a regular singular point as r→ 0 and an irregular one as r→ ∞. We give the restrictions to the parameters for a correct mathematical statement of the limit boundary conditions in singular points and their accurate transfer into the neighborhoods of these points using certain results for singular Cauchy problems and stable initial manifolds. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of bubble-type (droplet-type) solutions are discussed (in the form of additional restrictions to the parameters) and some estimates are obtained. A priori detailed analysis of a singular nonlinear BVP leads to efficient shooting methods for solving it approximately. Some results of the numerical experiments are displayed and their physical interpretation is discussed.","N. B. Konyukhova1, P. M. Lima2, M. L. Morgado3 & …M. B.

2421,Post-Pareto Analysis and a New Algorithm for the Optimal Parameter Tuning of the Elastic Net,"The paper deals with the optimal parameter tuning for the elastic net problem. This process is formulated as an optimization problem over a Pareto set. The Pareto set is associated with a convex multi-objective optimization problem, and, based on the scalarization theorem, we give a parametrical representation of it. Thus, the problem becomes a bilevel optimization with a unique response of the follower (strong Stackelberg game). Then, we apply this strategy to the parameter tuning for the elastic net problem. We propose a new algorithm called Ensalg to compute the optimal regularization path of the elastic net w.r.t. the sparsity-inducing term in the objective. In contrast to existing algorithms, our method can also deal with the so-called “many-at-a-time” case, where more than one variable becomes zero at the same time and/or changes from zero. In examples involving real-world data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.","Henri Bonnel

2422,Solving sparse principal component analysis with global support,"Sparse principal component analysis with global support (SPCAgs), is the problem of finding the top-r leading principal components such that all these principal components are linear combinations of a common subset of at most k variables. SPCAgs is a popular dimension reduction tool in statistics that enhances interpretability compared to regular principal component analysis (PCA). Methods for solving SPCAgs in the literature are either greedy heuristics (in the special case of \(r = 1\)) with guarantees under restrictive statistical models or algorithms with stationary point convergence for some regularized reformulation of SPCAgs. Crucially, none of the existing computational methods can efficiently guarantee the quality of the solutions obtained by comparing them against dual bounds. In this work, we first propose a convex relaxation based on operator norms that provably approximates the feasible region of SPCAgs within a \(c_1 + c_2 \sqrt{\log r} = O(\sqrt{\log r})\) factor for some constants \(c_1, c_2\). To prove this result, we use a novel random sparsification procedure that uses the Pietsch-Grothendieck factorization theorem and may be of independent interest. We also propose a simpler relaxation that is second-order cone representable and gives a \((2\sqrt{r})\)-approximation for the feasible region. Using these relaxations, we then propose a convex integer program that provides a dual bound for the optimal value of SPCAgs. Moreover, it also has worst-case guarantees: it is within a multiplicative/additive factor of the original optimal value, and the multiplicative factor is \(O(\log r)\) or O(r) depending on the relaxation used. Finally, we conduct computational experiments that show that our convex integer program provides, within a reasonable time, good upper bounds that are typically significantly better than the natural baselines.

This allows us to recover in this setting a number of properties of the zeroes of holomorphic functions.

2430,New approach for stability and bifurcation analysis on predator–prey harvesting model for interval biological parameters with time delays,"This paper presents a prey–predator harvesting model with time delay for bifurcation analysis. We consider the parameters of the proposed model with imprecise data as form of interval in nature, due to the lack of precise numerical information of the biological parameters such as prey population growth rate and predator population decay rate. The interaction between prey and predator is assumed to be governed by a Holling type II functional response and discrete type gestation delay of the predator for consumption of the prey under impreciseness of the biological parameters. Parametric functional form of interval number with two parameters is introduced. This study reveals that not only delay and harvesting effort play a significant role on the stability on the system but also interval parameters play a crucial role on the stability of the system. Computer simulations of numerical examples are given to explain our proposed imprecise model. We also address critically the biological implications of our analytical findings with proper numerical example.","D. Pal1, G. S. Mahapatra2 & G. P.

2431,Andronov-Hopf bifurcation and sensitivity analysis of a time-delay HIV model with logistic growth and antiretroviral treatment,"A mathematical model of the infection of CD4+ T-cells by HIV that includes the effects of treatment by a reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) and a protease inhibitor (PI) is studied. The model includes three populations of CD4+ T-cells (healthy cells, latently-infected cells which cannot produce virus, and productively-infected cells which can produce virus) and two populations of free virus in the blood (infectious virus and non-infectious virus). The model includes a time delay between a T-cell becoming latently infected and productively infected. The model has a virus-free and a chronic infection equilibrium. It is shown that the model has Andronov-Hopf bifurcations leading to limit cycle behavior in the chronic infection region at critical values of the time delays. For three data sets obtained from the work of previous authors, numerical simulations have given critical delay values ranging from approximately 15 days to more than 200 days. This range includes the period of approximately 50 days for intermittent viral blips reported by Rong and Perelson (Plos Comp. Biol. 5(10), 1-18 (2009)). Simple formulas are derived for the sensitivity indices of the equilibrium populations and the basic reproductive number with respect to all parameters in the model. Numerical simulations are carried out to support the analytical results. The numerical results suggest that the most effective methods of reducing both the basic reproductive number and the chronic infection CD4+ T-cell and virus populations are the following: (1) to increase the efficacy of the antiretroviral treatments and (2) to increase virus clearance rate, decrease infection rate, or decrease viral reproduction rate.","Rachadawan Darlai

We consider two explicit time-delays: one in the incidence rate of new infection to measuring the impact of the latent period, and another in the treatment rate of infectives to analyzing the effect of late treatment availability. The stability behavior of the model is analyzed for two equilibria: the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and the endemic equilibrium (EE). We derive the threshold quantity, the basic reproduction number \(R_0\), which determines the eradication or persistence of infectious diseases in the host population. Using the basic reproduction number, we show that the DFE is locally asymptotically stable when \(R_0< 1\), linearly neutrally stable when \(R_0= 1\), and unstable when \(R_0> 1\) for the time-delayed system. We analyze the system without a latent period, revealing the forward bifurcation at \(R_0= 1\), which implies that keeping \(R_0\) below unity can diminish the disease. Further, the stability behavior for the EE is investigated, demonstrating the occurrence of oscillatory and periodic solutions through Hopf bifurcation concerning every possible grouping of two time-delays as the bifurcation parameter. To conclude, the numerical simulations in support of the theoretical findings are carried out.

2437,Results on passivity analysis of delayed fractional-order neural networks subject to periodic impulses via refined integral inequalities,"This manuscript is concerned with analysing the passiveness of fractional-order neural networks with parameter uncertainties, delays, and periodic impulses. This work mainly focuses on the issue of the lack of suitable Lyapunov functionals for delay-dependent stability/passivity analysis of fractional-order systems (FOSs). First, a fractional-order free-matrix-based integral inequality is derived to estimate the fractional derivative of constructed Lyapunov function. Second, by introducing a fractional parameter, a refined looped functional is structured so that the resulting linear matrix inequality (LMI) includes all the information of delays in states, inter-impulse time, and impulse gain matrix. Then by fractional-order Lyapunov direct method, certain new delay-dependent passivity and stability criteria for the considered FONNs with and without delays are established in the form of LMIs. Numerical examples with simulations are given to pledge the correctness of the proposed theoretical results. Finally, a practical application of developed results is given.","N. Padmaja1 & P.

2438,Worst-case analysis of clique MIPs,"The usual integer programming formulation for the maximum clique problem has several undesirable properties, including a weak LP relaxation, a quadratic number of constraints and nonzeros when applied to sparse graphs, and poor guarantees on the number of branch-and-bound nodes needed to solve it. With this as motivation, we propose new mixed integer programs (MIPs) for the clique problem that have more desirable worst-case properties, especially for sparse graphs. The smallest MIP that we propose has just \(O(n+m)\) nonzeros for graphs with n vertices and m edges. Nevertheless, it ensures a root LP bound of at most \(d+1\), where d denotes the graph’s degeneracy (a measure of density), and is solved in \(O(2^d n)\) branch-and-bound nodes. Meanwhile, the strongest MIP that we propose visits fewer nodes, \(O(1.62^d n)\). Further, when a best-bound node selection strategy is used, \(O(2^g n)\) nodes are visited, where \(g=(d+1)-\omega \) is the clique-core gap. Often, g is so small that it can be treated as a constant in which case O(n) nodes are visited. Experiments are conducted to understand their performance in practice.","Mohammad Javad Naderi

2439,The Analysis of Impact of Brexit on the Post-Brexit EU Using Intervented Multivariate Time Series,"The UK is the most important partner of the EU in terms of economic and other fields due to the geographical proximity. It was one of the largest economies in the EU and its per capita income is higher than the EU average, so it is a net contributor to the EU. With UKs membership of the EU ended on 31 January 2019, there are concerns that the Brexit may have a significant impact on the EU, resulting in social, economic, political, and institutional changes, etc. in EU. While the impact of Brexit on the UK has always been the subject of considerable scholarly interest in recent years, there is relatively little literature on the impact of Brexit on the EU. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the impact of Brexit on the EU economy and other relevant aspects along three dimensions: GDP, PPP, Quarterly GDP growth. Employing powerful quantitative analysis technology that includes vector autoregression model, multivariate time series model with intervention variables, and autoregression integrated moving average, this paper obtains the important and novel evidence about the potential impact of Brexit on the EU economy, pointing out that Brexit is of far-reaching significance to the EU. This analysis uses several statistical models to screen out several key influencing factors, which can be used to predict the total GDP of EU in the next five years. The results show that EU economy will react negatively to “no-deal” Brexit, and its growth rate of economy will slow down significantly in next 5 years. Finally, we put forward relevant policy suggestions on how to deal with the negative impact of Brexit on EU.","Yu Tian1, Shao-pei Ma2, Rong-xiang Rui2, Zhen Yu2 & …Mao-zai Tian2,3,4,","Acta Mathematicae Applicatae Sinica, English Series",2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10255-021-1022-z,"intervention multivariate time series model,Brexit,economy,gaping Brexit hole,no-deal Brexit,post-Brexit EU"
2440,STEPWISE SQUARE INTEGRABLE REPRESENTATIONS FOR LOCALLY NILPOTENT LIE GROUPS,"In a recent paper we found conditions for a nilpotent Lie group N to have a filtration by normal subgroups whose successive quotients have square integrable representations, and such that these square integrable representations fit together nicely to give an explicit construction of Plancherel for almost all representations of N. The prototype for this sort of group is the group of upper triangular real matrices with 1’s down the diagonal. More generally, this class of groups contains the nilradicals of minimal parabolic subgroups of all (finite-dimensional) reductive real or complex Lie groups, in other words, all groups N in Iwasawa decompositions of reductive real or complex Lie groups.The construction of stepwise square integrable representations resulted in explicit character formulae, Plancherel formulae and multiplicity formulae. Here we extend those results to direct limits of stepwise square integrable nilpotent Lie groups. There are two keys to this extension. The first is to set up the corresponding direct system so that it respects the construction at every finite level. In the case of simple (or more generally reductive) groups this means that the restricted root Dynkin diagrams increase in a particular manner. The second is to follow Schwartz space theory through the direct limit process, develop a Schwartz space theory for certain direct limit nilpotent groups, and use it to study stepwise square integrability for coefficients of direct limits of stepwise square integrable nilpotent Lie groups. This leads to the main result, an explicit Fourier inversion formula for that class of infinite-dimensional Lie groups. One important consequence is the Fourier inversion formula for nilradicals of classical minimal parabolic subgroups of finitary real reductive Lie groups such as GL(∞; ℝ), Sp(∞; ℂ) and SO(∞, ∞).",JOSEPH A.

2441,Algebraic analysis of offsets to hypersurfaces," In this paper, we present a complete algebraic analysis of degeneration and existence of simple and special components of generalized offsets to irreducible hypersurfaces over algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero. More precisely, we analyze the degeneration situations when offseting, and we state that there exist, at most, a finite set of distances for which the offset of a hypersurface may degenerate. As a consequence of this analysis, an algorithmic method to determine such distances is derived. Furthermore, as an application of these results, a complete degeneration analysis of the generalized offset to the sphere is developed. In addition, we study the existence of simple and special components of the offset. In this context we prove that, in the case of classical offsets, there always exists at least one simple component and, in the case of generalized offsets, we prove that for almost every distance and for almost every isometry, all components of the offset are simple.",J.

2442,A Complete Spectral Analysis of Generalized Gribov–Intissar’s Operator in Bargmann Space,"In the Bargmann representation, we study mathematically rigorously some interesting spectral properties of generalized Gribov–Intissar’s operator: \(\displaystyle { \mathbb {H}_{\lambda ', \mu , \lambda } = \lambda ' a^{*^{p+1}} a^{p+1}} {+ \mu a^{*^{p}}a^{p} + i\lambda a^{*^{p}}(a + a^{*})a^{p}\, (p = 0, 1, 2\ldots )}\) where \(a^{*}\) and a are the creation and annihilation operators; \([a, a^{*} ] = \mathbb {I }\). \((\lambda ', \mu , \lambda ) \in \mathbb {R}^{3}\) are respectively the four coupling, the intercept and the triple coupling of Pomeron and \(i^{2} = - 1\). Firstly, the domain of the operator is defined precisely and it is shown that the minimal and the maximal version of the operator are identical; here as well as in many subsequent stages of the analysis we use extensively the representation of the operators in the Bargmann space of analytic functions. Then it is proved that \(\displaystyle { \mathbb {H}_{\lambda ', \mu , \lambda }}\) has compact resolvent and thus its spectrum consists of complex eigenvalues. Furthermore, \(\displaystyle { \mathbb {H}_{\lambda ', \mu , \lambda }}\) generates a strongly continuous semigroup such that for all \(t \ge 0\) and a constant \(c > 0\) the estimate \(\displaystyle {\mid \mid e^{-t\mathbb {H}_{\lambda ', \mu , \lambda }}\mid \mid \le e^{ct}}\) holds, and the operator \(\displaystyle { e^{-t(\mathbb {H}_{\lambda ', \mu , \lambda } + c)}}\) is compact for all \(t > 0\). Moreover, the solutions of the Cauchy problem \(\displaystyle {\frac{du}{dt} + \mathbb {H}_{\lambda ', \mu , \lambda }u = 0}\) can be expanded as a series in the eigenvectors of \(\displaystyle { \mathbb {H}_{\lambda ', \mu , \lambda }}\). Similar results concerning the associated semigroups are established for the operator \(\displaystyle { \mathbb {H}_{\lambda ', \mu , \lambda }}\) for \(\lambda ' = 0\). If \(p = 0\), \(\lambda ' = 0\) and \(\lambda \in i\mathbb {R}\) then \(\displaystyle { \mathbb {H}_{\lambda ', \mu , \lambda }}\) is the displaced harmonic oscillator. Secondly If \(p = 1\), the Reggeon field theory (Boreskov et al. in Phys Atomic Nucl 69(10):1765–1780, 2006; Gribov in Sov. Phys. JETP 26(2):414–423, 1968) is governed by \(\displaystyle { \mathbb {H}_{\lambda ', \mu ,\lambda }}\). In this case for \(\lambda '> 0 ,\mu > 0\), let \(\sigma (\lambda ',\mu , \lambda ) \ne 0\) be the smallest eigenvalue of \(H_{\lambda ',\mu ,\lambda }\), we show in this paper that \(\sigma (\lambda ',\mu , \lambda )\) is positive, increasing and analytic function on the whole real line with respect to \(\mu \) and that the spectral radius of \(H_{\lambda ',\mu ,\lambda }^{-1}\) converges to that of \(H_{0,\mu ,\lambda }^{-1}\) as \(\lambda '\) goes to zero. Hence we can exploit the structure of \(H_{\lambda ',\mu ,\lambda }^{-1}\) as \(\lambda '\) goes to zero to deduce the main results of Ando–Zerner established (Ando and Zerner in Commun Math Phys 93:123–139, 1984) on the function \(\sigma (0,\mu , \lambda )\). Thirdly, If \( \lambda ' = \mu = 0\), we consider the generalized operator \(\displaystyle {H^{p,m} = a^{*^{p}} (a^{m} + a^{*^{m}})a^{p}}\); \((p, m=1, 2,\ldots )\) of \(\displaystyle {-\frac{i}{\lambda }\mathbb {H}_{0, 0, \lambda }}\) acting on Bargmann space. For this operator, we find some conditions on the parameters p and m for that \(\displaystyle { H^{p,m}}\) to be completely indeterminate. It follows from these conditions that \(\displaystyle { H^{p,m}}\) is entire of the type minimal. And by applying the main result of the authors (Intissar and Intissar in Complex Anal Oper Theory 11(3):491–505, 2017), we show that \(\displaystyle { H^{p,m}}\) and \(\displaystyle { H^{p,m}+ H^{*^{p,m}}}\) are connected at the chaotic operators (where \(H^{*^{p,m}}\) is the adjoint of the \(H^{p,m}\)).","Abdelkader Intissar1,4 & Jean-Karim Intissar2,3,",Complex Analysis and Operator Theory,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11785-019-00895-1,"Spectral theory,Gribov–Intissar’s operators,Semigroups,Unbounded chaotic operators,Entire operators,Bargmann space,Reggeon field theory"

2444,"Heat–Viscoelastic Plate Interaction via Bending Moment and Shear Forces Operators: Analyticity, Spectral Analysis, Exponential Decay","We consider a heat–plate interaction model where the 2-dimensional plate is subject to viscoelastic (strong) damping. Coupling occurs at the interface between the two media, where each component evolves through differential operators. In this paper, we apply “high” boundary interface conditions, which involve the two classical boundary operators of a physical plate: the bending moment operator \(B_1\) and the shear forces operator \(B_2\). We prove three main results: analyticity of the corresponding contraction semigroup on the natural energy space; sharp location of the spectrum of its generator, which does not have compact resolvent, and has the point \(\lambda =-\,1\) in its continuous spectrum; exponential decay of the semigroup with sharp decay rate.

2445,Analysis of an Epidemic System with Two Response Delays in Media Impact Function,"A functional differential model of SEIS-M type with two time delays, representing the response time for mass media to cover the current infection and for individuals’ behavior changes to media coverage, was proposed to examine the delayed media impact on the transmission dynamics of emergent infectious diseases. The threshold dynamics were established in terms of the basic reproduction number \({\mathcal {R}}_{0}\). When there are no time delays, we showed that if the media impact is low, the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for \({\mathcal {R}}_{0}>1\), while the endemic equilibrium may become unstable and Hopf bifurcation occurs for some appropriate conditions by taking the level of media impact as bifurcation parameter. With two time delays, we comprehensively investigated the local and global bifurcation by considering the summation of delays as a bifurcation parameter, and theoretically and numerically examined the onset and termination of Hopf bifurcations from the endemic equilibrium. Main results show that either the media described feedback cycle, from infection to the level of mass media and back to disease incidence, or time delays can induce Hopf bifurcation and result in periodic oscillations. The findings indicate that the delayed media impact leads to a richer dynamics that may significantly affect the disease infections.",Pengfei Song1 & Yanni Xiao,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-019-00586-0,"Media impact,Functional differential model,Time delays,Global Hopf bifurcation"

Noting that stationary solutions of our neural field equation are equivalent to homoclinic orbits in a related fourth order ordinary differential equation, we apply normal form theory for a reversible Hopf bifurcation to prove the existence of localized solutions; further, we present results concerning their stability. Numerical continuation is used to compute branches of localized solution that exhibit snaking-type behaviour. We describe in terms of three parameters the exact regions for which localized solutions persist.","Grégory Faye1, James Rankin1 & Pascal Chossat",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-012-0532-y,"Localized state,Neural field equation,Reversible Hopf-bifurcation,Normal form,Orbital stability,Numerical continuation"

Such a configurations can be characterized as critical point of the Hamiltonian function restricted on the constant angular impulse hyper-surface in the phase space (topologically a pseudo-sphere whose coefficients are the circulation strengths of the vortices). Relative equilibria are generated by the circle action on the so-called shape pseudo-sphere (which generalize the standard shape sphere appearing in the study of the N-body problem). Inspired by the planar N-body problem, and after a geometrical and dynamical discussion of the problem, we investigate the relation intertwining the stability of relative equilibria and the inertia indices of the central configurations generating such equilibria. In the last section we applied our main results to some symmetric three and four vortices relative equilibria.","Xijun Hu1, Alessandro Portaluri

2451,Multiscale analysis of slow-fast neuronal learning models with noise,"This paper deals with the application of temporal averaging methods to recurrent networks of noisy neurons undergoing a slow and unsupervised modification of their connectivity matrix called learning. Three time-scales arise for these models: (i) the fast neuronal dynamics, (ii) the intermediate external input to the system, and (iii) the slow learning mechanisms. Based on this time-scale separation, we apply an extension of the mathematical theory of stochastic averaging with periodic forcing in order to derive a reduced deterministic model for the connectivity dynamics. We focus on a class of models where the activity is linear to understand the specificity of several learning rules (Hebbian, trace or anti-symmetric learning). In a weakly connected regime, we study the equilibrium connectivity which gathers the entire ‘knowledge’ of the network about the inputs. We develop an asymptotic method to approximate this equilibrium. We show that the symmetric part of the connectivity post-learning encodes the correlation structure of the inputs, whereas the anti-symmetric part corresponds to the cross correlation between the inputs and their time derivative. Moreover, the time-scales ratio appears as an important parameter revealing temporal correlations.","Mathieu Galtier1,2 & Gilles Wainrib",The Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2190-8567-2-13,"slow-fast systems,stochastic differential equations,inhomogeneous Markov process,averaging,model reduction,recurrent networks,unsupervised learning,Hebbian learning,STDP"

This paradigm incorporates the assumption that real-valued coordinates provide a rich enough class of functions to represent the data faithfully and efficiently. On the other hand, there are simple structures which challenge this assumption: the circle, for example, is one-dimensional, but its faithful representation requires two real coordinates. In this work, we present a strategy for constructing circle-valued functions on a statistical data set. We develop a machinery of persistent cohomology to identify candidates for significant circle-structures in the data, and we use harmonic smoothing and integration to obtain the circle-valued coordinate functions themselves. We suggest that this enriched class of coordinate functions permits a precise NLDR analysis of a broader range of realistic data sets.","Vin de Silva1, Dmitriy Morozov2 & Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson",Discrete & Computational Geometry,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-011-9344-x,"Dimensionality reduction,Computational topology,Persistent homology,Persistent cohomology"

This hybrid method begins with a limited number of steps of the Arnoldi method to obtain some information on the location of the spectrum ofA, and then switches to a Richardson iterative method based on Faber polynomials. For a polygonal domain, the Faber polynomials can be constructed recursively from the parameters in the Schwarz-Christoffel mapping function. In four specific numerical examples of non-normal matrices, we show that this hybrid algorithm converges quite well and is approximately as fast or faster than the hybrid GMRES or restarted versions of the GMRES algorithm.

Next, an imaginary structure which is composed of two identically overlapping sectors is constructed, and that the complex constraints mentioned above can be equivalently replaced by a set of real constraints on this imaginary struture is proved. Therefore, the stress analysis of a cyclically symmetric structure can be solved conveniently by most of finite element programs.","Tang Guoan Professor1, Ding Jun1 & Xu Xiaofeng",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2000,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02458544,"cyclically symmetric structure,finite element method,stress analysis"

We study the uniqueness and stability of the reconstruction. In the case where the wavelets are Cauchy wavelets, we prove that the modulus of the wavelet transform uniquely determines the function up to a global phase. We show that the reconstruction operator is continuous but not uniformly continuous. We describe how to construct pairs of functions which are far away in \(L^2\)-norm but whose wavelet transforms are very close, in modulus. The principle is to modulate the wavelet transform of a fixed initial function by a phase which varies slowly in both time and frequency. This construction seems to cover all the instabilities that we observe in practice; we give a partial formal justification to this fact. Finally, we describe an exact reconstruction algorithm and use it to numerically confirm our analysis of the stability question.",Stéphane Mallat1 & Irène Waldspurger,Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00041-015-9403-4,"Phase retrieval,Wavelet transform,Cauchy wavelets"

φ admits a decomposition that reveals it to bestrictly positive-definite. In this latter case we characterize those operators that aresectorial.

The aim of this work is to define and develop a White Noise Theory-based anticipative stochastic calculus with respect to all Gaussian processes that have an integral representation over a real (maybe infinite) interval. Very rich, this class of Gaussian processes contains, among many others, Volterra processes (and thus fractional Brownian motion) as well as processes the regularity of which varies along the time (such as multifractional Brownian motion). A systematic comparison of the stochastic calculus (including Itô formula) we provide here, to the ones given by Malliavin calculus in Aloś (Ann. Probab. 29(2), 766–801 2001), Mocioalca and Viens (J.

2482,Comparison of Sub-Gramian Analysis with Eigenvalue Analysis for Stability Estimation of Large Dynamical Systems,"In earlier works, solutions of Lyapunov equations were represented as sums of Hermitian matrices corresponding to individual eigenvalues of the system or their pairwise combinations. Each eigen-term in these expansions are called a sub-Gramian. In this paper, we derive spectral decompositions of the solutions of algebraic Lyapunov equations in a more general formulation using the residues of the resolvent of the dynamics matrix. The qualitative differences and advantages of the sub-Gramian approach are described in comparison with the traditional analysis of eigenvalues when estimating the proximity of a dynamical system to its stability boundary. These differences are illustrated by the example of a system with a multiple root and a system of two resonating oscillators. The proposed approach can be efficiently used to evaluate resonant interactions in large dynamical systems.","I. B. Yadykin1,2 & A. B.

2483,Conservative State-Space Realizations of Dissipative System Behaviors,"It is well known that a Schur-class function S (contractive operator-valued function on the unit disk) can be realized as the transfer function S(z) = D + zC(I − zA)−1
B of a conservative discrete-time linear system (x(n + 1) = Ax(n) + Bu(n), y(n) = Cx(n) + Du(n) with
\( U = \left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}l} A & B\\ C & D\end{array}} \right]\) unitary). One method of proof of this result (the “lurking isometry” method) identifies a solution U of the problem as a unitary extension of a partially defined isometry V determined by the problem data. Reformulated in terms of the graphs of V and U, solutions are identified with embeddings of an isotropic subspace of a certain Krein space
\(\mathcal{K}\) constructed from the problem data into a Lagrangian subspace (maximal isotropic subspace of
\(\mathcal{K}\)). The contribution here is the observation that this reformulation applies to other types of realization problems as well, e.g., realization of positive-real or J-contractive operator-valued functions over the unit disk (respectively over the right half plane) as the transfer function of a discrete-time (respectively, continuous-time) conservative system, i.e., an input-state-output system for which there is a quadratic storage function on the state space for which all system trajectories satisfy an energy-balance equation with respect to the appropriate supply rate on input-output pairs. The approach allows for unbounded state dynamics, unbounded input/output operators and descriptor-type state-space representations where needed in a systematic way.

Local search methods play a major role in many of these metaheuristic procedures. In this paper, we adapt a recent and popular indicator-based selection method proposed by Zitzler and Künzli in 2004, in order to define a population-based multi-objective local search. The proposed algorithm is designed in order to be easily adaptable, parameter independent and to have a high convergence rate. In order to evaluate the capacity of our algorithm to reach these goals, a large part of the paper is dedicated to experiments. Three combinatorial optimisation problems are tested: a flow shop problem, a ring star problem and a nurse scheduling problem. The experiments show that our algorithm can be applied with success to different types of multi-objective optimisation problems and that it outperforms some classical metaheuristics. Furthermore, the parameter sensitivity analysis enables us to provide some useful guidelines about how to set the parameters.","M. Basseur1,2, A. Liefooghe3, K. Le1 & …E. K.

2499,Tree-based methods: a useful tool for life insurance,Life insurance faces a number of new challenges. This paper identifies some difficulties with techniques that are widely used to cope with these challenges. As an interesting alternative tree-based methods are suggested and discussed. In particular a “hybrid” approach (using regression trees for a classification situation) is proposed. The main advantage of this approach is its ease of interpretability and its inherent transparency. The method appears to be particularly suitable for the identification of the risk factors in complex situations like disability insurance.,Walter Olbricht,European Actuarial Journal,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13385-012-0045-5,"Tree-based methods,Life insurance,Risk factors,Multivariate statistical techniques"

2503,First Order Perturbation and Local Stability of Parametrized Systems,"A problem frequently encountered in geometric constraint solving and related settings is to ascertain sensitivity of solutions arising from a well constrained input configuration. This is important for tolerancing and motion planning, for example. An example would be determining lines simultaneously tangent to four given spheres (which originates as a line-of-sight problem); how much does a perturbation of the input affect the positioning of these lines. Once translated to an algebraic setting one has a system of polynomial equations with some coefficients parametrized, and wants to determine the solutions and a good approximation of their sensitivity to changes in the parameters. We will compute this sensitivity from first order changes in an appropriate Gröbner basis. We demonstrate the applicability on several examples. We also discuss a more global form of stability, wherein one wants to know about perturbations that might change the character of the solution space e.g. by having fewer than the generic number of solutions.",Daniel Lichtblau,Mathematics in Computer Science,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11786-016-0249-1,"Constraint geometry,Parametric polynomial system solving,Sensitivity to perturbations"
2504,Haar expectations of ratios of random characteristic polynomials,"We compute Haar ensemble averages of ratios of random characteristic polynomials for the classical Lie groups \(K = \mathrm {O}_N\,\), \(\mathrm {SO}_N\,\), and \(\mathrm {USp}_N\,\). To that end, we start from the Clifford–Weyl algebra in its canonical realization on the complex \(\fancyscript {A}_V\) of holomorphic differential forms for a \(\mathbb {C} \)-vector space \(V_0\,\). From it we construct the Fock representation of an orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra \(\mathfrak {osp}\) associated to \(V_0\,\). Particular attention is paid to defining Howe’s oscillator semigroup and the representation that partially exponentiates the Lie algebra representation of \(\mathfrak {sp} \subset \mathfrak {osp}\). In the process, by pushing the
 semigroup representation to its boundary and arguing by continuity, we provide a construction of the Shale–Weil–Segal representation of the metaplectic group. To deal with a product of n ratios of characteristic polynomials, we let \(V_0 = \mathbb {C}^n \otimes \mathbb {C}^N\) where \(\mathbb {C}^N\) is equipped with the standard K-representation, and focus on the subspace \(\fancyscript {A}_V^K\) of K-equivariant forms. By Howe duality, this is a highest-weight irreducible representation of the centralizer \(\mathfrak {g}\) of \(\mathrm {Lie}(K)\) in \(\mathfrak {osp}\). We identify the K-Haar expectation of n ratios with the character of this \(\mathfrak {g} \)-representation, which we show to be uniquely determined by analyticity, Weyl-group invariance, certain weight constraints, and a system of differential equations coming from the Laplace-Casimir invariants of \(\mathfrak {g}\,\). We find an explicit solution to the problem posed by all these conditions. In this way, we prove that the said Haar expectations are expressed by a Weyl-type character formula for all integers \(N \ge 1\). This completes earlier work of Conrey, Farmer, and Zirnbauer for the case of \(\mathrm {U}_N\,\).","A. Huckleberry1, A. Püttmann2 & M. R.

2505,Slice Fueter-Regular Functions,"Slice Fueter-regular functions, originally called slice Dirac-regular functions, are generalized holomorphic functions defined over the octonion algebra \({\mathbb {O}}\), recently introduced by M. Jin, G. Ren and I. Sabadini. A function \(f:\Omega _D\subset {\mathbb {O}}\rightarrow {\mathbb {O}}\) is called (quaternionic) slice Fueter-regular if, given any quaternionic subalgebra \({\mathbb {H}}_{\mathbb {I}}\) of \({\mathbb {O}}\) generated by a pair \({\mathbb {I}}=(I,J)\) of orthogonal imaginary units I and J (\({\mathbb {H}}_{\mathbb {I}}\) is a ‘quaternionic slice’ of \({\mathbb {O}}\)), the restriction of f to \({\mathbb {H}}_{\mathbb {I}}\) belongs to the kernel of the corresponding Cauchy–Riemann–Fueter operator \(\frac{\partial }{\partial x_0}+I\frac{\partial }{\partial x_1}+J\frac{\partial }{\partial x_2}+(IJ)\frac{\partial }{\partial x_3}\). The goal of this paper is to show that slice Fueter-regular functions are standard (complex) slice functions, whose stem functions satisfy a Vekua system having exactly the same form of the one characterizing axially monogenic functions of degree zero. The mentioned standard sliceness of slice Fueter-regular functions is able to reveal their ‘holomorphic nature’: slice Fueter-regular functions have Cauchy integral formulas, Taylor and Laurent series expansions, and a version of Maximum Modulus Principle, and each of these properties is global in the sense that it is true on genuine 8-dimesional domains of \({\mathbb {O}}\). Slice Fueter-regular functions are real analytic. Furthermore, we introduce the global concepts of spherical Dirac operator \(\Gamma \) and of slice Fueter operator \({\overline{\vartheta }}_F\) over octonions, which allow to characterize the slice Fueter-regular functions as the \({\mathscr {C}}^2\)-functions in the kernel of \({\overline{\vartheta }}_F\) satisfying a second order differential system associated with \(\Gamma \).","Riccardo Ghiloni

2507,Sufficiency-Type Stability and Stabilization Criteria for Linear Time-Invariant Systems with Constant Point Delays,We derive a set of criteria of asymptotic stability for linear and time-invariant systems with multirate point delays. The criteria are concerned with α-stability local in the delays and ε-stability independent of the delays and are classified in several groups according to the technique dealt with. The techniques used include both Lyapunov's matrix inequalities and equalities and Gerschgorin's circle theorem. Lyapunov's inequalities are guaranteed if a set of matrices built from matrices of undelayed and delayed dynamics are stability matrices. Some extensions to robust stability of the above results are also discussed.,M. de la Sen,Lithuanian Mathematical Journal,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1026137301902,"point delays,stability and stabilization,time-delay systems"

Harmonic analysis and Lie theory are the mathematical prerequisites for its deduction.ResultsThe main result is a linear system of partial differential equations (referred to as the structure equations) that describe the result of signal processing in the cochlea. It is formulated for phase and for the logarithm of the amplitude. The changes of these quantities are the essential physiological observables in the description of signal processing in the auditory pathway.ConclusionsThe structure equations display in a quantitative way the subtle balance for processing information on the basis of phase versus amplitude. From a mathematical point of view, the linear system of equations is classified as an inhomogeneous

In suitable variables the solutions can be represented as the superposition of a particular solution (determined by the system) and a holomorphic function (determined by the incoming signal).

2509,A Refinement of the Robertson–Schrödinger Uncertainty Principle and a Hirschman–Shannon Inequality for Wigner Distributions,"We propose a refinement of the Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty principle (RSUP) using Wigner distributions. This new principle is stronger than the RSUP. In particular, and unlike the RSUP, which can be saturated by many phase space functions, the refined RSUP can be saturated by pure Gaussian Wigner functions only. Moreover, the new principle is technically as simple as the standard RSUP. In addition, it makes a direct connection with modern harmonic analysis, since it involves the Wigner transform and its symplectic Fourier transform, which is the radar ambiguity function. As a by-product of the refined RSUP, we derive inequalities involving the entropy and the covariance matrix of Wigner distributions. These inequalities refine the Shanon and the Hirschman inequalities for the Wigner distribution of a mixed quantum state \(\rho \). We prove sharp estimates which critically depend on the purity of \(\rho \) and which are saturated in the Gaussian case.","Nuno Costa Dias1,2, Maurice A. de Gosson3 & João Nuno Prata1,",Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00041-018-9602-x,"Wigner distribution,Uncertainty principles,Entropic relations"
2510,Linear stability of slowly rotating Kerr black holes,"We prove the linear stability of slowly rotating Kerr black holes as solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations: linearized perturbations of a Kerr metric decay at an inverse polynomial rate to a linearized Kerr metric plus a pure gauge term. We work in a natural wave map/DeTurck gauge and show that the pure gauge term can be taken to lie in a fixed 7-dimensional space with a simple geometric interpretation. Our proof rests on a robust general framework, based on recent advances in microlocal analysis and non-elliptic Fredholm theory, for the analysis of resolvents of operators on asymptotically flat spaces. With the mode stability of the Schwarzschild metric as well as of certain scalar and 1-form wave operators on the Schwarzschild spacetime as an input, we establish the linear stability of slowly rotating Kerr black holes using perturbative arguments; in particular, our proof does not make any use of special algebraic properties of the Kerr metric. The heart of the paper is a detailed description of the resolvent of the linearization of a suitable hyperbolic gauge-fixed Einstein operator at low energies. As in previous work by the second and third authors on the nonlinear stability of cosmological black holes, constraint damping plays an important role. Here, it eliminates certain pathological generalized zero energy states; it also ensures that solutions of our hyperbolic formulation of the linearized Einstein equations have the stated asymptotics and decay for general initial data and forcing terms, which is a useful feature in nonlinear and numerical applications.","Dietrich Häfner1, Peter Hintz2 & András Vasy",Inventiones mathematicae,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-020-01002-4,"Primary 83C05,58J50,Secondary 83C57,35B40,83C35"

This shows that not only the Stein space  but also its normalization is completely determined by the ring  of global analytic functions on X. This result was already proved in 1988 by Hayes–Pourcin when  is an irreducible Stein space, whereas in this paper we afford the general case. We also analyze the real underlying structures  and  of a reduced complex analytic space  and its normalization . We prove that the complexification of  provides the normalization of the complexification of  if and only if  is a coherent real analytic space. Roughly speaking, coherence of the real underlying structure is equivalent to the equality of the following two combined operations: (1) normalization + real underlying structure + complexification, and (2) real underlying structure + complexification + normalization.","Francesca Acquistapace1, Fabrizio Broglia1 & José F.

real-analytic hypersurface M in

p ∈ M 
are uniquelydetermined by their jets of some finite order at 
p if and only if M is
not Levi-flat near p. This seems to be the first necessary and sufficient
result on finite jet determination and the first result of this kind in
the infinite type case.If M is of finite type at p, 
we prove a stronger assertion: the local real-analytic 
CR automorphisms of M fixing p 
are analytically parametrized (and hence uniquely determined) 
by their 2-jets at p.
This result is optimal since the automorphisms of the unit sphere are
not determined by their 1-jets at a point of the sphere. The finite
type condition is necessary since otherwise the needed jet order can
be arbitrarily high [Kow1,2], [Z2]. Moreover, we show, by an example,
that determination by 2-jets fails for finite type hypersurfaces already

2519,Symmetric orthonormal complex wavelets with masks of arbitrarily high linear-phase moments and sum rules,"In this paper, we investigate compactly supported symmetric orthonormal dyadic complex wavelets such that the symmetric orthonormal refinable functions have high linear-phase moments and the antisymmetric wavelets have high vanishing moments. Such wavelets naturally lead to real-valued symmetric tight wavelet frames with some desirable moment properties, and are related to coiflets which are real-valued and are of interest in numerical algorithms. For any positive integer m, employing only the Riesz lemma without solving any nonlinear equations, we obtain a 2π-periodic trigonometric polynomial \(\hat a\) with complex coefficients such that 


(i)
\(\hat a\) is an orthogonal mask: \(|\hat a(\xi)|^2+|\hat a(\xi+\pi)|^2=1\).


(ii)
\(\hat a\) has m + 1 − odd
m
 sum rules: \(\hat a(\xi+\pi)=O(|\xi|^{m+1-odd_m})\) as ξ→0, where \(odd_m:=\frac{1-(-1)^m}{2}\).


(iii)
\(\hat a\) has m + odd
m
 linear-phase moments: \(\hat a(\xi)=e^{{{\mathrm{i}}} c\xi}+O(|\xi|^{m+odd_m})\) as ξ→0 with phase c = − 1/2.


(iv)
\(\hat a\) has symmetry and coefficient support [2 − 2m,2m − 1]: \(\hat a(\xi)=\sum_{k=2-2m}^{2m-1} h_k e^{-{{\mathrm{i}}} k\xi}\) with h1 − k

 vanishing moments, and ϕ is a compactly supported symmetric orthonormal refinable function with the special linear-phase moments: \(\int_{{{\mathbb R}}} \phi(x)dx=1\) and \(\int_{{{\mathbb R}}} (x-1/2)^j \phi(x) dx=0\) for all j = 1,...,m + odd

Both functions ϕ and ψ are supported on [2 − 2m,2m − 1].The mask of a coiflet has real coefficients and satisfies (i), (ii), and (iii), often with a general phase c and the additional condition that the order of the linear-phase moments is equal (or close) to the order of the sum rules. On the one hand, as Daubechies showed in [3, 5] that except the Haar wavelet, any compactly supported dyadic orthonormal real-valued wavelets including coiflets cannot have symmetry. On the other hand, solving nonlinear equations, [4, 12] constructed many interesting real-valued dyadic coiflets without symmetry. But it remains open whether there is a family of real-valued orthonormal wavelets such as coiflets whose masks can have arbitrarily high linear-phase moments. This partially motivates this paper to study the complex wavelet case with symmetry property. Though symmetry can be achieved by considering complex wavelets, the symmetric Daubechies complex orthogonal masks in [11] generally have no more than 2 linear-phase moments. In this paper, we shall study and construct orthonormal dyadic complex wavelets and masks with symmetry, linear-phase moments, and sum rules. Examples and two general construction procedures for symmetric orthogonal masks with high linear-phase moments and sum rules are given to illustrate the results in this paper.

The package processes the set of historical events (affecting whole lines or portions of lines), and assigns a list of dates to each edge of the graph. Then, when a date is given to the system, it computes the right coloring for each edge, and constructs and plots an accurate map of the railway network at that given date according to the geographic coordinates of the nodes of the graph.

A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such representation is introduced. Using an analysis approach that employs the solution to the linear Diophantine equations, further characterization and modeling of the spectral properties of evanescent fields are provided by considering their spectral pseudo-density function, defined in this paper. The geometric properties of the spectral pseudo-density of the evanescent field are investigated.

2528,A hybrid stochastic optimization framework for composite nonconvex optimization,"We introduce a new approach to develop stochastic optimization algorithms for a class of stochastic composite and possibly nonconvex optimization problems. The main idea is to combine a variance-reduced estimator and an unbiased stochastic one to create a new hybrid estimator which trades-off the variance and bias, and possesses useful properties for developing new algorithms. We first introduce our hybrid estimator and investigate its fundamental properties to form a foundational theory for algorithmic development. Next, we apply our new estimator to develop several variants of stochastic gradient method to solve both expectation and finite-sum composite optimization problems. Our first algorithm can be viewed as a variant of proximal stochastic gradient methods with a single loop and single sample, but can achieve the best-known oracle complexity bound as state-of-the-art double-loop algorithms in the literature. Then, we consider two different variants of our method: adaptive step-size and restarting schemes that have similar theoretical guarantees as in our first algorithm. We also study two mini-batch variants of the proposed methods. In all cases, we achieve the best-known complexity bounds under standard assumptions. We test our algorithms on several numerical examples with real datasets and compare them with many existing methods. Our numerical experiments show that the new algorithms are comparable and, in many cases, outperform their competitors.","Quoc Tran-Dinh

The model exhibits two equilibria, namely, the adopter-free and an interior equilibrium. The existence and local stability of the adopter-free and interior equilibria are explored in terms of the effective Basic Influence Number (BIN) RA. It is investigated that the adopter free steady-state is stable if RA < 1. By considering τ (the adoption experience of the adopters) as the bifurcation parameter, we have been able to obtain the critical value of τ responsible for the periodic solutions due to Hopf bifurcation. The direction and stability analysis of bifurcating periodic solutions has been performed by using the arguments of normal form theory and the center manifold theorem. Exhaustive numerical simulations in the support of analytical results have been presented.","Rakesh Kumar1, Anuj Kumar Sharma2 & Govind Prasad Sahu",Acta Mathematica Scientia,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10473-022-0120-1,"intra-specific competition,basic influence number,local stability,Hopf-bifurcation,normal form theory,center manifold theorem"

Let \((q,x)\mapsto ({q_1},{x_1})\) be the classical modular substitution given by the relations \({q_1}=\text {e}^{-2\pi i/\tau }\) and \({x_1}=\text {e}^{2\pi i{z}/{\tau }}\). The main goal of this paper is to give a modular-type representation for the infinite product \((x;q)_\infty \), this means, to compare the function defined by \((x;q)_\infty \) with that given by \(({x_1};{q_1})_\infty \). Inspired by the work (Stieltjes in Collected Papers, Springer, New York, 1993) of Stieltjes on semi-convergent series, we are led to a “closed” analytic formula for the ratio \((x;q)_\infty /({x_1};{q_1})_\infty \) by means of the dilogarithm combined with a Laplace type integral, which admits a divergent series as Taylor expansion at \(\log q=0\). Thus, the function \((x;q)_\infty \) is linked with its modular transform \(({x_1};{q_1})_\infty \) in such an explicit manner that one can directly find the modular formulae known for Dedekind’s Eta function, Jacobi Theta function, and also for certain Lambert series.

2538,Numerical stability of the cyclic Richardson iteration,"The success of the cyclic Richardson iteration depends on the proper ordering of the acceleration parameters. We give a rigorous error analysis to show that, with the proper ordering, the relative error in the iterative method, when properly terminated, is not larger than the error incurred in stable direct methods such as Cholesky factorization. For both the computed approximation\(\tilde u\) tou=L
−1f satisfies\(\left\| {u - \tilde u} \right\|\) ≦ cond (L)‖u‖2−t and this bound is attainable. We also show that the residual norm\(\left\| {f - L\tilde u} \right\|\) is bounded by ‖L‖ cond\((L)\left\| {\tilde u} \right\|2^{ - t} \). This bound is attainable for a small cycle lengthN. Our analysis suggests that for a larger cycle lengthN the residuals are bounded by\(\sqrt {cond(L)} \left\| L \right\|\left\| {\tilde u} \right\|2^{ - t} \). We construct a theoretical example in which this bound is attainable. However we observed in all numerical tests that ultimately the residual norms were of order\(\left\| L \right\|\left\| {\tilde u} \right\|2^{ - t} \). We explain why in practice even the factor\(\sqrt {cond(L)} \) is never encountered. Therefore the residual stopping criterion for the Richardson iteration appears to be very reliable and the method itself appears to be stable.",Adam T.

2539,On the validity of the Ginzburg-Landau equation,"The famous Ginzburg-Landau equation describes nonlinear amplitude modulations of a wave perturbation of a basic pattern when a control parameterR lies in the unstable regionO(ε
2) away from the critical valueR
c for which the system loses stability. Hereε>0 is a small parameter. G-L's equation is found for a general class of nonlinear evolution problems including several classical problems from hydrodynamics and other fields of physics and chemistry. Up to now, the rigorous derivation of G-L's equation for general situations is not yet completed. This was only demonstrated for special types of solutions (steady, time periodic) or for special problems (the Swift-Hohenberg equation). Here a mathematically rigorous proof of the validity of G-L's equation is given for a general situation of one space variable and a quadratic nonlinearity. Validity is meant in the following sense. For each given initial condition in a suitable Banach space there exists a unique bounded solution of the initial value problem for G-L's equation on a finite interval of theO(1/ε2)-long time scale intrinsic to the modulation. For such a finite time interval of the intrinsic modulation time scale on which the initial value problem for G-L's equation has a bounded solution, the initial value problem for the original evolution equation with corresponding initial conditions, has a unique solutionO(ε2) — close to the approximation induced by the solution of G-L's equation. This property guarantees that, for rather general initial conditions on the intrinsic modulation time scale, the behavior of solutions of G-L's equation is really inherited from solutions of the original problem, and the other way around: to a solution of G-L's equation corresponds a nearby exact solution with a relatively small error.",A. van Harten,Journal of Nonlinear Science,1991,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02429847,"nonlinear stability theory,modulation equations,approximation on a long time scale,error estimates"

2541,Understanding Clustering in Type Space Using Field Theoretic Techniques,"
The birth/death process with mutation describes the evolution of a population, and displays rich dynamics including clustering and fluctuations. We discuss an analytical ‘field-theoretical’ approach to the birth/death process, using a simple dimensional analysis argument to describe evolution as a ‘super-Brownian motion’ in the infinite population limit. The field theory technique provides corrections to this for large but finite population, and an exact description at arbitrary population size. This allows a characterisation of the difference between the evolution of a phenotype, for which strong local clustering is observed, and a genotype for which distributions are more dispersed. We describe the approach with sufficient detail for non-specialists.

2542,Some applications of the condensation of the singularities of families of nonnegative functions,"RecentlyPrus-Wiśniowski [14] has proved that the continuous functions of Λ-bounded variation on [0, 1] form a set of the first category in the Banach space C[0, 1] and also in each Banach space CΓBV[0, 1] of continuous functions of Γ-bounded variation on [0, 1] provided that the sequence Γ is adequate. In the present paper these results are extended and completed by using a principle of the condensation of the singularities of a family of nonnegative functions that follows from the theorems given byBreckner [3]. It is shown that Baire category properties similar to those stated in [14] are valid for two very large classes of real-valued functions called functions of bounded λ-variation of orderp and functions of boundedmth variation of orderp, respectively. The benefit of considering these classes is that they comprise several classes of functions of bounded variation type which have occurred so far in Fourier analysis or real analysis; in particular, the functions investigated in [14]. Thus, by specializing the results derived in the present paper, they give at once Baire category information concerning a number of well-known sets of real-valued functions.","Wolfgang W.

2544,Efficient Interval Linear Equality Solving in Constraint Logic Programming,"Existing interval constraint logic programming languages, such as BNR Prolog, work under the framework of interval narrowing and are deficient in solving systems of linear constraints over real numbers, which constitute an important class of problems in engineering and other applications. In this paper, we suggest to separate linear equality constraint solving from inequality and non-linear constraint solving. The implementation of an efficient interval linear constraint solver, which is based on the preconditioned interval Gauss-Seidel method, is proposed. We show how the solver can be adapted to incremental execution and incorporated into a constraint logic programming language already equipped with a non-linear solver based on interval narrowing. The two solvers share common interval variables, interact and cooperate in a round-robin fashion during computation, resulting in an efficient interval constraint arithmetic language CIAL.

Green operators in the sense of Boutet de Monvel (Acta Math 126:11–51, 1971) analogously appear in singular cases, and they are complemented by contributions of Mellin type.

Various models are reviewed and in a formal analysis, their capability of simulating and explaining classical conditioning is investigated.

That study has been a source for modern research in the dynamic of traveling wave solutions of different type and it has been disseminated through publication of scientific articles and/or books. Here, we provide the reader with information about current research in stability theory for nonlinear dispersive equations and possible developments. Also, I hope it inspires future developments in this important and fascinating subject. In this manuscript we consider the following topics: stability theory of solitary waves and the applicability of the concentration–compactness principle, the existence and orbital (in)stability of periodic traveling wave solutions for nonlinear dispersive models, nonlinear Schrödinger and Korteweg–de Vries models on star-shaped metric graphs. The use of tools of the theory of spaces of Hilbert, the spectral theory for unbounded self-adjoint operators, Sturm–Liouville’s theory, variational methods, analytic perturbation theory of operators, and the extension theory of symmetric operators are pieces fundamental in our study.

We investigate conditions that lead to aggregation of microglia and formation of local accumulations of chemicals observed in AD senile plaques. We develop a model for chemotaxis in response to a combination of chemoattractant and chemorepellent signaling chemicals. Linear stability analysis and numerical simulations of the model predict that periodic patterns in cell and chemical distributions can evolve under local attraction, long-ranged repulsion, and other constraints on concentrations and diffusion coefficients of the chemotactic signals. Using biological parameters from the literature, we compare and discuss the applicability of this model to actual processes in AD.","Magdalena Luca1, Alexandra Chavez-Ross2, Leah Edelstein-Keshet2 & …Alex Mogilner",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1016/S0092-8240%2803%2900030-2,"Hopf Bifurcation,Pattern Formation,Senile Plaque,Linear Stability Analysis,Negative Real Part"
2555,Efficiency of the price formation process in presence of high frequency participants: a mean field game analysis,"This paper deals with a stochastic order-driven market model with waiting costs, for orderbooks with heterogenous traders. Offer and demand of liquidity drives price formation and traders anticipate future evolutions of the orderbook. The natural framework we use is mean field game theory, a class of stochastic differential games with a continuum of anonymous players. Several sources of heterogeneity are considered including the mean size of orders. Thus we are able to consider the coexistence of Institutional Investors and high frequency traders (HFT). We provide both analytical solutions and numerical experiments. Implications on classical quantities are explored: orderbook size, prices, and effective bid/ask spread. According to the model, in markets with Institutional Investors only we show the existence of inefficient liquidity imbalances in equilibrium, with two symmetrical situations corresponding to what we call liquidity calls for liquidity. During these situations the transaction price significantly moves away from the fair price. However this macro phenomenon disappears in markets with both Institutional Investors and HFT, although a more precise study shows that the benefits of the new situation go to HFT only, leaving Institutional Investors even with higher trading costs.","Aimé Lachapelle1, Jean-Michel Lasry2, Charles-Albert Lehalle

2556,Randomized Quaternion QLP Decomposition for Low-Rank Approximation,"The low-rank approximation of a quaternion matrix has attracted growing attention in many applications including color image processing and signal processing. In this paper, based on quaternion normal distribution random sampling, we propose a randomized quaternion QLP decomposition algorithm for computing a low-rank approximation to a quaternion data matrix. For the theoretical analysis, we first present convergence results of the quaternion QLP decomposition, which provides slightly tighter upper bounds than the existing ones for the real QLP decomposition. Then, for the randomized quaternion QLP decomposition, the matrix approximation error and the singular value approximation error analyses are also established to show the proposed randomized algorithm can track the singular values of the quaternion data matrix with high probability. Finally, we present some numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness and reliablity of the proposed algorithm.","Huan Ren1, Ru-Ru Ma2, Qiaohua Liu3 & …Zheng-Jian Bai",Journal of Scientific Computing,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-022-01917-5,"Quaternion data matrix,Low-rank approximation,Quaternion QLP decomposition,Randomized algorithm"

Asε → 0+ these maps asymptote to flows which attain a heteroclinic connection. We show that for smallε the heteroclinic connection breaks up and that the splitting between its components scales withε likeε
γexp[-β/ε]. We estimateβ using the singularities of theε → 0+ heteroclinic orbit in the complex plane. We then estimateγ using linearization about orbits in the complex plane. These estimates, as well as the assertions regarding the behavior of the functions in the complex plane, are supported by our numerical calculations.","C. Amick1, E. S. C. Ching1, L. P.

2559,Bifurcation and optimal control analysis of a delayed drinking model,"Alcoholism is a social phenomenon that affects all social classes and is a chronic disorder that causes the person to drink uncontrollably, which can bring a series of social problems. With this motivation, a delayed drinking model including five subclasses is proposed in this paper. By employing the method of characteristic eigenvalue and taking the temporary immunity delay for alcoholics under treatment as a bifurcation parameter, a threshold value of the time delay for the local stability of drinking-present equilibrium and the existence of Hopf bifurcation are found. Then the length of delay has been estimated to preserve stability using the Nyquist criterion. Moreover, optimal strategies to lower down the number of drinkers are proposed. Numerical simulations are presented to examine the correctness of the obtained results and the effects of some parameters on dynamics of the drinking model.","Zizhen Zhang1, Junchen Zou1 & Soumen Kundu",Advances in Difference Equations,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13662-020-02987-1,"92B05,92D40,92D30"

We further describe how regularity or local exponentiality of a Lie group can be used to obtain quite satisfactory answers to some of the fundamental problems.

2565,The selection of Saffman-Taylor fingers by kinetic undercooling,"The selection of Saffman-Taylor fingers by surface tension has been widely studied. Here their selection is analysed by another regularisation widely adopted in studying otherwise ill-posed Stefan problems, namely kinetic undercooling. An asymptotic-beyond-all-orders analysis (which forms the core of the paper) reveals for small kinetic undercooling how a discrete family of fingers is selected; while these are similar to those arising for surface tension, the asymptotic analysis exhibits a number of additional subtleties. In Appendix 1 a description of some general features of the Hele-Shaw problem with kinetic undercooling and an analysis of the converse limit in which kinetic undercooling effects are large are included, while Appendix 2 studies the role of exponentially small terms in a simple linear problem which clarifies the rather curious behaviour at the origin of Stokes lines in the Hele-Shaw problem with kinetic undercooling.",S.J.

2566,Supremizers of inner γ-convex functions,"A real-valued function f defined on a convex subset D of some normed linear space is said to be inner γ-convex w.r.t. some fixed roughness degree γ  >  0 if there is a \(\nu \in]0, 1]\) such that \({\rm sup}_{\lambda\in[2,1+1/\nu]} \left(f((1 - \lambda)x_0 + \lambda x_1) - (1 - \lambda) f (x_0)-\right. \left.\lambda f(x_1)\right) \geq 0\) holds for all \(x_0, x_1 \in D\) satisfying ||x
0 − x
1||  =  νγ and \(-(1/\nu)x_0+(1+1/\nu)x_1\in D\) . This kind of roughly generalized convex functions is introduced in order to get some properties similar to those of convex functions relative to their supremum. In this paper, numerous properties of their supremizers are given, i.e., of such \(x^* \in D\) satisfying lim \({\rm sup}_{x \to x^*}f(x) = {\rm sup}_{x \in D} f(x)\) . For instance, if an upper bounded and inner γ-convex function, which is defined on a convex and bounded subset D of some inner product space, has supremizers, then there exists a supremizer lying on the boundary of D relative to aff D or at a γ-extreme point of D, and if D is open relative to aff D or if dim D  ≤  2 then there is certainly a supremizer at a γ-extreme point of D. Another example is: if D is an affine set and \(f : D \to {\mathbb{R}}\) is inner γ-convex and bounded above, then \({\rm sup}_{x'\in \bar B(x,\gamma/2)\cap D}f(x')= \sup_{x'\in D}f(x')\) for all \(x \in D\) , and if 2 ≤  dim D  <  ∞ then each \(x \in D\) is a supremizer of f.",Hoang Xuan Phu,Mathematical Methods of Operations Research,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00186-007-0187-4,"Generalized convexity,Rough convexity,Inner γ-convex function,Supremizer,

2569,The Role of the Common in Cognitive Prosperity: Our Command of the Unspeakable and Unwriteable,"There are several features of law which rightly draw the interest of philosophers, especially those whose expertise lies in ethics and social and political philosophy. But the law also has features which haven’t stirred much in the way of philosophical investigation. I must say that I find this surprising. For the fact is that a well-run criminal trial is a master-class in logic and epistemology. Below I examine the logical and epistemological properties of greatest operational involvement in a criminal proceedings, concepts such as evidence, proof, argument, inference, relevance, probability, and more. My principal objective is to expose the deep cleavage between establishment norms in epistemology and logic and standard practice in criminal proceedings. This gives us two options to reflect upon. In one, the establishment norms for the correct management of the concepts in question are basically sound. In that case, as I will show, common law criminal practice would be basically unsound; its convictions would be basically false and unjust. Seen from the other perspective, the criminal justice system would be basically sound, and its criminal convictions basically true and just. It turns out to matter that option one meets with widely spread common disbelief and is generally taken as contrary to common knowledge. What is needed here is an epistemology which gives these sentiments some air to breathe. I will argue that on balance it is the logico-epistemic establishment which requires some serious rethinking.",John Woods,Logica Universalis,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11787-021-00289-y,"Causal-response epistemology,Cognitive economics,Commonness,Criminal jurisprudence,Implicity,Information,Phase transitions,Storage,Tacity"

Especially if little information can be got in advance, detection of heteroscedasticity as well as estimation of statistical models could be even more difficult. To this end, this paper proposes a quantile difference method (QDM) that can effectively estimate the heteroscedastic function. This method, being completely free from the estimation of mean regression function, is simple, robust and easy to implement. Moreover, the QDM method enables the detection of heteroscedasticity without any restrictions on error terms, consequently being widely applied. What is worth mentioning is that based on the proposed approach estimators of both mean regression function and heteroscedastic function can be obtained. In the end, the authors conduct some simulations to examine the performance of the proposed methods and use a real data to make an illustration.","Wentao Xia1, Wei Xiong2 & Maozai Tian",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-015-3161-x,"Heteroscedastic function estimation,heteroscedasticity testing,mean regression function,quantile difference"

This includes, as special cases, the sign vector systems that encode complex arrangements according to [BZ], and the complexified oriented matroids, whose complements were considered by Gel'fand and Rybnikov [GeR].Our framework makes it possible to study complex hyperplane arrangements as entirely combinatorial objects. By comparing complex matroids with 2-matroids, which model the more general 2-arrangements introduced by Goresky and MacPherson [GoM], the essential combinatorial meaning of a “complex structure” can be isolated.Our development features a topological representation theorem for 2-matroids and complex matroids, and the computation of the cohomology of the complement of a 2-arrangement, including its multiplicative structure in the complex case. Duality is established in the cases of complexified oriented matroids, and for realizable complex matroids.

These functions naturally emerge in the twistor interpretation of slice regularity introduced in Gentili et al. (J Eur Math Soc 16(11):2323–2353, 2014) and developed in Altavilla (J Geom Phys 123:184–208, 2018). To any slice-polynomial function P we associate its companion\(P^\vee \) and its extension to the real axis \(P_{\mathbb {R}}\), that are quaternionic functions naturally related to P. Then, using the theory of twistor spaces, we are able to show that for any quaternion q the cardinality of simultaneous pre-images of q via P, \(P^\vee \) and \(P_{\mathbb {R}}\) is generically constant, giving a notion of degree. With the brand new tool of slice-polynomial functions, we compute the twistor discriminant locus of a cubic scroll \(\mathcal {C}\) in \(\mathbb {CP}^3\) and we conclude by giving some qualitative results on the complex structures induced by \(\mathcal {C}\) via the twistor projection.",A.

Here we aim to study the rumor spread mechanism and the influential factors using epidemic like model. We have divided the total population into three groups, namely, ignorant, spreader and aware. We have used delay differential equations to describe the dynamics of rumor spread process and studied the stability of the steady-state solutions using the threshold value of influence which is analogous to the basic reproduction number in disease model. Global stability of rumor prevailing state has been proved by using Lyapunov function. An optimal control system is set up using media awareness campaign to minimize the spreader population and the corresponding cost. Hopf bifurcation analyses with respect to time delay and the transmission rate of rumors are discussed here both analytically and numerically.

2584,An exact analysis of the sliding motion in contractile system: A simplified model of muscle system,"A system involving two kinds of sliding filaments is analysed with special attention to the actomyosin system. Rigorous results are obtained about the statistical effect originating from many active sites distributed on both filaments. It is necessary for the occurrence of smooth motion in sliding filament that the spatial periods of active sites on both filaments are relatively incommensurable, and that the number of active sites on each filament is large enough. Sufficient conditions for smooth contraction are derived under the assumption that both filaments are rigid; this is called rigid rod approximation in the present paper. The elastic mode of the filaments, during the sliding process, is analysed by perturbation theory based on the rigid rod approximation.

Using bounds on ranges of intermediate results, represented as weights on the nodes and a suitable mix of forward and backward evaluation, it is possible to give efficient implementations of interval evaluation and automatic differentiation. It is shown how to combine this with constraint propagation techniques to produce narrower interval derivatives and slopes than those provided by using only interval automatic differentiation preceded by constraint propagation. The implementation is based on earlier work by L.V. Kolev, (1997), Reliable Comput., 3, 83–93 on optimal slopes and by C. Bliek, (1992), Computer Methods for Design Automation, PhD Thesis, Department of Ocean Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology on backward slope evaluation. Care is taken to ensure that rounding errors are treated correctly. Interval techniques are presented for computing from the DAG useful redundant constraints, in particular linear underestimators for the objective function, a constraint, or a Lagrangian. The linear underestimators can be found either by slope computations, or by recursive backward underestimation. For sufficiently sparse problems the work is proportional to the number of operations in the calculation of the objective function (resp. the Lagrangian).",Hermann Schichl1 & Arnold Neumaier,Journal of Global Optimization,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-005-0937-x,"automatic differentiation,constraint propagation,directed acyclic graphs,global optimization,interval analysis,slope"

Defined at interpixel level, this set of two trees allows to topologically describe the (black and white) connected component distribution within the image with regards to the relationship “to be surrounded by”. This distribution is condensed into a rooted tree, such that its nodes are connected components determined by some special sub-trees of the previous HSF and the levels of the tree specify the degree of nesting of each connected component. We ask for topological auto-similarity by comparing this topological description of the whole image with a regular rooted tree pattern. Such an analysis can be used to directly quantify some characteristics of biomedical images (e.g. cells samples or clinical images) that are not so noticeable when using geometrical approaches.","S.

2601,Analysis of program logic test strategies,"


1.
The planning of program tests should be based on three principal criteria: structured coverage, the probability of residual error, and the probability of revealing a residual error.


2.
When basing planning on the first criterion one should consider that the complexity of testing structured graphs is independent of the method of coverage selection but entirely depends on the maximum rank (“height”) and cyclomatic number (“width”) of the graph. The reliability of testing nonstructured graphs is higher when more complex methods are applied for test route selection. When testing resources are limited it is desirable to use a method of covering all edges of the graph for which the complexity of testing is proportional to the width of the program graph.


3.
The strategy of ordering test routes by duration is preferable for testing with the purpose of minimizing the probability of the presence of a residual error; for narrow structured graphs this strategy also allows minimization of the probability of revealing a residual error. The strategy of ordering test routes by the probability of execution makes it possible more easily to obtain a program with a specified probability of revealing a residual error. With increasing nonstructurality and graph width the strategy becomes also preferable with respect to the criterion of the probability of a residual error.

The numerical solution is formally interpreted as the exact solution of a perturbed differential equation, given as a formal and usually divergent series in powers of the step size. For a rigorous analysis, this series has to be truncated.
 In this article we study the influence of this truncation to the difference between the numerical solution and the exact solution of the perturbed differential equation. Results on the long-time behaviour of numerical solutions are obtained in this way. We present applications to the numerical phase portrait near hyperbolic equilibrium points, to asymptotically stable periodic orbits and Hopf bifurcation, and to energy conservation and approximation of invariant tori in Hamiltonian systems.

Our preconditioned matrix is constructed by using a trigonometric polynomial θ(x,y) obtained from Fourier/kernel approximations or from the use of a proper interpolation scheme. Both of the above techniques produce a trigonometric polynomial θ(x,y) which approximates the generating function f(x,y), and hence the preconditioned matrix is forced to have clustered spectrum. As θ(x,y) is chosen to be a trigonometric polynomial, the preconditioner is a block band Toeplitz matrix with Toeplitz blocks, and therefore its inversion does not increase the total complexity of the PCG method. Preconditioning by block Toeplitz matrices has been treated in the literature in several papers.

Numerical stability issues typically arise because of different time-stepping strategies applied to the coupled PDE system. In particular, the contributing factors include using large time steps, lack of accurate interface flux, and single-iteration coupling. We investigate the stability of the coupled ocean–atmosphere models for various interface conditions such as the Dirichlet–Neumann condition and the bulk interface condition, which is unique to climate modeling. By analyzing a simplified model, we demonstrate how the parameterization of the bulk condition and other numerical and physical parameters affect the coupling stability and establish stability conditions for different coupling strategies.","Hong Zhang

Starting from the orthogonal Clifford setting, by simply introducing a so-called complex structure J ∈ SO(2n;\({\mathbb{R}}\)), the fundamental elements of the Hermitean setting arise in a quite natural way. Indeed, the corresponding projection operators 1/2 (1 ± iJ) project the initial basis (eα, α = 1, . . . , 2n) onto the Witt basis and moreover give rise to a direct sum decomposition of  into two components, where the SO(2n;\({\mathbb{R}}\))-elements leaving those two subspaces invariant, commute with the complex structure J. They generate a subgroup which is doubly covered by a subgroup of Spin(2n;\({\mathbb{R}}\)), denoted Spin

J
(2n;\({\mathbb{R}}\)), being isomorphic with the unitary group U(n;\({\mathbb{C}}\)). Finally the two Hermitean Dirac operators are shown to originate as generalized gradients when projecting the gradient on the invariant subspaces mentioned, which actually implies their invariance under the action of Spin
J
(2n;\({\mathbb{R}}\)). The eventual goal is to extend the complex structure J to the whole Clifford algebra  , in order to conceptually unravel the true meaning of Hermitean monogenicity and its connections to orthogonal monogenicity.","Fred Brackx1, Jarolím Bureš2, Hennie De Schepper1, David Eelbode1, Frank Sommen1 & …Vladímir Souček",Complex Analysis and Operator Theory,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11785-007-0010-5,Primary 30G35
2617,Analysis of a coupled finite-infinite element method for exterior Helmholtz problems," This analysis of convergence of a coupled FEM-IEM is based on our previous work on the FEM and the IEM for exterior Helmholtz problems. The key idea is to represent both the exact and the numerical solution by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators that they induce on the coupling hypersurface in the exterior of an obstacle. The investigation of convergence can then be related to a spectral analysis of these DtN operators. We give a general outline of our method and then proceed to a detailed investigation of the case that the coupling surface is a sphere. Our main goal is to explore the convergence mechanism. In this context, we show well-posedness of both the continuous and the discrete models. We further show that the discrete inf-sup constants have a positive lower bound that does not depend on the number of DOF of the IEM. The proofs are based on lemmas on the spectra of the continuous and the discrete DtN operators, where the spectral characterization of the discrete DtN operator is given as a conjecture from numerical experiments. In our convergence analysis, we show algebraic (in terms of N) convergence of arbitrary order and generalize this result to exponential convergence.",Leszek Demkowicz1 & Frank Ihlenburg,Numerische Mathematik,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00005440,Mathematics Subject Classification (1991): 65N30

2620,Regional complexity analysis of algorithms for nonconvex smooth optimization,"A strategy is proposed for characterizing the worst-case performance of algorithms for solving nonconvex smooth optimization problems. Contemporary analyses characterize worst-case performance by providing, under certain assumptions on an objective function, an upper bound on the number of iterations (or function or derivative evaluations) required until a pth-order stationarity condition is approximately satisfied. This arguably leads to conservative characterizations based on certain objectives rather than on ones that are typically encountered in practice. By contrast, the strategy proposed in this paper characterizes worst-case performance separately over regions comprising a search space. These regions are defined generically based on properties of derivative values. In this manner, one can analyze the worst-case performance of an algorithm independently from any particular class of objectives. Then, once given a class of objectives, one can obtain a tailored complexity analysis merely by delineating the types of regions that comprise the search spaces for functions in the class. Regions defined by first- and second-order derivatives are discussed in detail and example complexity analyses are provided for a few standard first- and second-order algorithms when employed to minimize convex and nonconvex objectives of interest. It is also explained how the strategy can be generalized to regions defined by higher-order derivatives and for analyzing the behavior of higher-order algorithms.","Frank E. Curtis

2621,Moment analysis for localization in random Schrödinger operators,"We study localization effects of disorder on the spectral and dynamical properties of Schrödinger operators with random potentials. The new results include exponentially decaying bounds on the transition amplitude and related projection kernels, including in the mean. These are derived through the analysis of fractional moments of the resolvent, which are finite due to the resonance-diffusing effects of the disorder. The main difficulty which has up to now prevented an extension of this method to the continuum can be traced to the lack of a uniform bound on the Lifshitz-Krein spectral shift associated with the local potential terms. The difficulty is avoided here through the use of a weak-L

The pair potential is encoded in the virial coefficients of the virial equation of state for a gas.The complete iterative inversion method is a technique employed in an attempt to recover the pair potential from the second virial coefficient. Implicit in the complete iterative inversion method is the requirement that various mathematical expressions are meaningful: improper integrals converge, derivatives exist, etc.We provide a mathematical framework in which all these implicit assumptions are valid.

We have solved the integer program by the canonical branch-and-bound method. In this paper we present a branch-and-cut method, a careful theoretical analysis of our formulation and why our approach is so effective. The result of cutting plane analysis is that two types of well-known cuts for this problem are already implied in the constraint set, which provides us some intuition that our formulation would be very effective. Experimental results show that for about 99 percent of real threading instances, the linear relaxations of their integer programs solve to integral optimal solutions directly. For the rest one percent of real instances, the integral solutions can be obtained with only several branch nodes. Experimental results also show that no special template or sequence features result in more possibilities of fractional solutions. This indicates that extra effort to seek for cutting planes to strengthen the existing formulation is unnecessary.","Jinbo Xu1, Ming Li1 & Ying Xu",Journal of Combinatorial Optimization,2004,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10878-004-4834-x,"protein threading,integer program,branch-and-cut,cutting plane,CAFASP"

The choice of prediction sample affects the relative error and the prediction length which were also under good concern. The results show that the model provided here are practical for the modeling and prediction of time series created by chaotic repellers.

The model of the system produces a non-self-adjoint eigenvalue problem which does not yield a self-orthogonal set of eigenfunctions with respect to the usual inner product. Therefore, these functions cannot be used to calculate the coefficients of expansion in the Fourier series. Furthermore, the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are complex-valued. The eigenfunctions can be utilized if the space of the wave operator is extended and a suitable inner product is defined. It is further demonstrated that the series solution contains the solutions for free–free, fixed–damper, fixed–fixed, and fixed–free bar cases. The presented procedure is applicable in general to other problems of this type. As an illustration of the theoretical discussion, the results from numerical simulations are presented.",Vojin Jovanovic,Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-012-9559-8,"Longitudinal vibrations,Modal decomposition,Non-self-adjoint operator,Vibratory response,Viscous boundary conditions"

In particular, we use spectral techniques for a linear stability analysis to characterise and directly compose patterns emerging from homogeneities. We develop an implementation using surface finite element methods and a numerical eigenanalysis of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on surface meshes. In addition, we describe a technique to explore solutions of the nonlinear RD equations using numerical continuation. Here, we present a multiresolution approach that allows us to trace solution branches of the nonlinear equations efficiently even for large-scale meshes. Finally, we demonstrate the working of our framework for two RD systems with applications in biological pattern formation: a Brusselator model that has been used to model pattern development on growing plant tips, and a chemotactic model for the formation of skin pigmentation patterns. While these models have been used previously on simple geometries, our framework allows us to study the impact of arbitrary geometries on emerging patterns.","Daljit Singh J. Dhillon

The task of the learning controller for each subsystem is to iteratively generate a sequence of upgraded control inputs to take responsibilities of a sequential step functional control signals with distinct scales which are determined by the local decision-making units in the two-layer hierarchical steady-state optimization processing. The objective of the designated strategy is to consecutively improve the transient performance of the system. By means of the generalized Young inequality of convolution integral, the convergence of the learning algorithm is analyzed in the sense of Lebesgue-p norm.

2646,An analysis of approximations for maximizing submodular set functions—I,"LetN be a finite set andz be a real-valued function defined on the set of subsets ofN that satisfies z(S)+z(T)≥z(S⋃T)+z(S⋂T) for allS, T inN. Such a function is called submodular. We consider the problem maxS⊂N{a(S):|S|≤K,z(S) submodular}.Several hard combinatorial optimization problems can be posed in this framework. For example, the problem of finding a maximum weight independent set in a matroid, when the elements of the matroid are colored and the elements of the independent set can have no more thanK colors, is in this class. The uncapacitated location problem is a special case of this matroid optimization problem.We analyze greedy and local improvement heuristics and a linear programming relaxation for this problem. Our results are worst case bounds on the quality of the approximations. For example, whenz(S) is nondecreasing andz(0) = 0, we show that a “greedy” heuristic always produces a solution whose value is at least 1 −[(K − 1)/K]
K times the optimal value. This bound can be achieved for eachK and has a limiting value of (e − 1)/e, where e is the base of the natural logarithm.","G. L. Nemhauser1, L. A. Wolsey1 & M. L.

Consequently, we can extract local information with respect to frequency. We observe the time series in both the time domain and the frequency domain simultaneously.

We present a localization algorithm, which consists in constructing an ensemble of decision trees for the parameters of the dipole sources (which are responsible for the approximation of the potential detected at various time instants) and finding the most probable source regions on the basis of a special voting procedure. It is demonstrated that the approach that employs the decision trees technique allows a stable determination of the parameters of the transient function between the source and the signal detected, which is essential for the construction of the brain-computer interface.

2654,Post factum analysis for robust multiple criteria ranking and sorting,"Providing partial preference information for multiple criteria ranking or sorting problems results in the indetermination of the preference model. Investigating the influence of this indetermination on the suggested recommendation, we may obtain the necessary, possible and extreme results confirmed by, respectively, all, at least one, or the most and least advantageous preference model instances compatible with the input preference information. We propose a framework for answering questions regarding stability of these results. In particular, we are investigating the minimal improvement that warrants feasibility of some currently impossible outcome as well as the maximal deterioration by which some already attainable result still holds. Taking into account the setting of multiple criteria ranking and sorting problems, we consider such questions in view of pairwise preference relations, or attaining some rank, or assignment. The improvement or deterioration of the sort of an alternative is quantified with the change of its performances on particular criteria and/or its comprehensive score. The proposed framework is useful in terms of design, planning, formulating the guidelines, or defining the future performance targets. It is also important for robustness concern because it finds which parts of the recommendation are robust or sensitive with respect to the modification of the alternatives’ performance values or scores. Application of the proposed approach is demonstrated on the problem of assessing environmental impact of main European cities.","Miłosz Kadziński1, Krzysztof Ciomek1, Paweł Rychły1 & …Roman Słowiński1,",Journal of Global Optimization,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-015-0359-3,"Multiple criteria decision aiding,Additive value function,Sensitivity analysis,Linear programming,Distance-based uncertainty analysis,Performance values"

In the networked micro-grid control system, it is observed that transfer of incremental frequency variable (feedback variable—an indication of the in-balance between the generation and the demand) through open communication links to effect closed-loop load frequency control introduces time-delays in the feedback path. The feedback delays are generally time-varying in nature, and invariably, they exert a detrimental effect to the overall performance of the closed-loop system paving way to instability. In this paper, using the classical Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional approach combined with appropriate inequalities, less conservative delay-dependent stability criteria are presented in linear matrix inequality (LMI) framework for networked micro-grid control system with time-varying and time-invariant delays. In the sequel, the presented results are validated on a standard benchmark system.","K. Ramakrishnan

After application of the Mellin transform with respect to radius, the problem is reduced to a system of linear algebraic equations. By use of the residue calculus during the inverse Mellin transform, the stress asymptotics at the wedge apex is obtained.

Here, we present two approaches to modelling this phenomenon. The aim is to discover the basic mechanisms that drive PCP, while keeping the models mathematically tractable. We present a feedback and diffusion model, in which adjacent cell sides of neighbouring cells are coupled by a negative feedback loop and diffusion acts within the cell. This approach can give rise to polarity, but also to period two patterns. Polarisation arises via an instability provided a sufficiently strong feedback and sufficiently weak diffusion. Moreover, we discuss a conservative model in which proteins within a cell are redistributed depending on the amount of proteins in the neighbouring cells, coupled with intracellular diffusion. In this case, polarity can arise from weakly polarised initial conditions or via a wave provided the diffusion is weak enough. Both models can overcome small anomalies in the initial conditions. Furthermore, the range of the effects of groups of cells with different properties than the surrounding cells depends on the strength of the initial global cue and the intracellular diffusion.","S.

2673,Analyzing Multiple Phenotypes Based on Principal Component Analysis,"Joint analysis of multiple phenotypes can have better interpretation of complex diseases and increase statistical power to detect more significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compare to traditional single phenotype analysis in genome-wide association analysis. Principle component analysis (PCA), as a popular dimension reduction method, has been broadly used in the analysis of multiple phenotypes. Since PCA transforms the original phenotypes into principal components (PCs), it is natural to think that by analyzing these PCs, we can combine information across phenotypes. Existing PCA-based methods can be divided into two categories, either selecting one particular PC manually or combining information from all PCs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive principle component test (APCT) which selects and combines the PCs adaptively by using Cauchy combination method. Our proposed method can be seen as a generalization of traditional PCA based method since it contains two existing methods as special situation. Extensive simulation shows that our method is robust and can generate powerful result in various situations. The real data analysis of stock mice data also demonstrate that our proposed APCT can identify significant SNPs that are missed by traditional methods.","De-liang Bu1,2, San-guo Zhang1,2 & Na Li1,","Acta Mathematicae Applicatae Sinica, English Series",2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10255-022-1019-2,"multiple phenotypes,principal component analysis,cauchy combination method"

We examine the steady state solutions of the hormone transport model of Smith et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103(5):1301–1306, 2006) for a one-dimensional row of plant cells. We search for the steady state solutions as a function of three of the model parameters by using numerical continuation methods and bifurcation analysis. These methods are more adequate for solving steady state problems than time step methods. We discuss a trivial solution where the concentrations of hormones are equal in all cells and examine its stability region. We identify two generic bifurcation scenarios through which the trivial solution loses its stability. The trivial solution becomes either a steady state pattern with regular spaced peaks or a pattern where the concentration is periodic in time.","Delphine Draelants1, Jan Broeckhove1, Gerrit T. S.

Carefully honed algorithms yield results that are uniformly superior to those of the stock, deterministic implementations in Spark (the popular platform for distributed computation); in particular, whereas the stock software will without warning return left singular vectors that are far from numerically orthonormal, a significantly burnished randomized implementation generates left singular vectors that are numerically orthonormal to nearly the machine precision.","Huamin Li1, Yuval Kluger2 & Mark Tygert",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-018-9600-1,"Spark,Parallel,Cluster,Orthogonalization"
2680,Some axioms for constructive analysis,"This note explores the common core of constructive, intuitionistic, recursive and classical analysis from an axiomatic standpoint. In addition to clarifying the relation between Kleene’s and Troelstra’s minimal formal theories of numbers and number-theoretic sequences, we propose some modified choice principles and other function existence axioms which may be of use in reverse constructive analysis. Specifically, we consider the function comprehension principles assumed by the two minimal theories EL and M, introduce an axiom schema CFd asserting that every decidable property of numbers has a characteristic function, and use it to describe a precise relationship between the minimal theories. We show that the axiom schema AC00 of countable choice can be decomposed into a monotone choice schema AC
m00
 (which guarantees that every Cauchy sequence has a modulus) and a bounded choice schema BC00. We relate various (classically correct) axiom schemas of continuous choice to versions of the bar and fan theorems, suggest a constructive choice schema AC1/2,0 (which incidentally guarantees that every continuous function has a modulus of continuity), and observe a constructive equivalence between restricted versions of the fan theorem and correspondingly restricted bounding axioms \({AB_{1/2,0}^{2^{\mathbb{N}}}}\). We also introduce a version WKL!! of Weak König’s Lemma with uniqueness which is intermediate in strength between WKL and the decidable fan theorem FTd.",Joan Rand Moschovakis1 & Garyfallia Vafeiadou,Archive for Mathematical Logic,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00153-012-0273-z,"Axioms,Formal,Constructive,Intuitionistic,Analysis"
2681,An Asymptotic Analysis of a 2-D Model of Dynamically Active Compartments Coupled by Bulk Diffusion,"A class of coupled cell–bulk ODE–PDE models is formulated and analyzed in a two-dimensional domain, which is relevant to studying quorum-sensing behavior on thin substrates. In this model, spatially segregated dynamically active signaling cells of a common small radius \(\epsilon \ll 1\) are coupled through a passive bulk diffusion field. For this coupled system, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to construct steady-state solutions and to formulate a spectral problem that characterizes the linear stability properties of the steady-state solutions, with the aim of predicting whether temporal oscillations can be triggered by the cell–bulk coupling. Phase diagrams in parameter space where such collective oscillations can occur, as obtained from our linear stability analysis, are illustrated for two specific choices of the intracellular kinetics. In the limit of very large bulk diffusion, it is shown that solutions to the ODE–PDE cell–bulk system can be approximated by a finite-dimensional dynamical system. This limiting system is studied both analytically, using a linear stability analysis and, globally, using numerical bifurcation software. For one illustrative example of the theory, it is shown that when the number of cells exceeds some critical number, i.e., when a quorum is attained, the passive bulk diffusion field can trigger oscillations through a Hopf bifurcation that would otherwise not occur without the coupling. Moreover, for two specific models for the intracellular dynamics, we show that there are rather wide regions in parameter space where these triggered oscillations are synchronous in nature. Unless the bulk diffusivity is asymptotically large, it is shown that a diffusion-sensing behavior is possible whereby more clustered spatial configurations of cells inside the domain lead to larger regions in parameter space where synchronous collective oscillations between the small cells can occur. Finally, the linear stability analysis for these cell–bulk models is shown to be qualitatively rather similar to the linear stability analysis of localized spot patterns for activator–inhibitor reaction–diffusion systems in the limit of long-range inhibition and short-range activation.",J.

2682,Difference Schemes for a Drain Transfer Equation Based on Analysis in the Space of Undefined Coefficients,"AbstractA family of difference schemes on an explicit five-point stencil for the numerical solution of the linear transfer equation is considered. To construct and study the properties of difference schemes, a generalized approximation condition is used. Difference schemes in the space of undefined coefficients are analyzed. In this case, the problem of constructing the optimal difference scheme is reduced to a linear programming problem. A family of hybrid difference schemes is also considered. For them, the switching parameter will be the locally calculated dimensionless wavenumber. The analysis also shows that when constructing schemes with a higher approximation order, their local properties will be determined by the halved dimensionless wavenumber (in comparison with the scheme of the first approximation order). For the transfer equation with a linear sink, a family of difference schemes is also constructed based on such an analysis. In this case, more solutions to the linear programming problem are possible: schemes of a higher order of approximation on an unexpanded template (compact schemes) are among the optimal ones. The properties of the optimal schemes of a higher order of approximation in the case of an equation with a sink are determined by a dimensionless parameter that depends on both the wavenumber and the sink’s coefficient. Considering that for an equation with a sink, difference schemes have somewhat better computational qualities than for a homogeneous linear equation, when solving systems of the hyperbolic type by the splitting method, it is advisable to select the part with a linear sink and it is for this that a hybrid difference scheme is constructed that has a variable order of approximation on the solution of the differential problem. Numerical examples of the implemented schemes are given for the simplest linear equation.",A. I. Lobanov1 & F. H.

The multiple cavities, embedded in an infinite ground plane, is filled with inhomogeneous media characterized by variable dielectric permittivities and magnetic permeabilities. Corresponding to the transverse electric, the scattering problem can be studied by the Helmholtz equation in frequency domain and wave equation in time-domain respectively. A novel transparent boundary condition in time-domain is developed to reformulate the cavity scattering problem into an initial-boundary value problem in a bounded domain. The well-posedness and stability of the reduced problem are established. Moreover, a priori energy estimates for the electric field is obtained with minimum regularity requirement for the data and an explicit dependence on the time by studying the wave equation directly.","Yang Liu1, Yi-xian Gao1 & Jian Zu","Acta Mathematicae Applicatae Sinica, English Series",2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10255-020-0911-x,"Helmholtz equation,wave equation,multiple cavities,stability,a priori estimates"

The classical thin plate theory is used to derive mechanical energies of the traveling plate. As derivative of transverse displacement with respect to time in the compatibility condition equation exists, an exponential function is introduced to depict the dynamic deformation of the moving plate. It is shown that this exponential function works well with the Rayleigh- Ritz method. A convergence study shows a quick convergence speed for the immersed moving plate. Furthermore, the parametric study is carried out to demonstrate the effect of system parameters including the moving speed, the plate location, the liquid depth, the plate-liquid ratio, and the boundary condition. Results show that the above system parameters have significant influence on the vibration characteristics of the immersed moving plate.

2704,Harmonic analysis on the infinite symmetric group,"The infinite symmetric group S(∞), whose elements are finite permutations of {1,2,3,...}, is a model example of a “big” group. By virtue of an old result of Murray–von Neumann, the one–sided regular representation of S(∞) in the Hilbert space ℓ2(S(∞)) generates a type II1 von Neumann factor while the two–sided regular representation is irreducible. This shows that the conventional scheme of harmonic analysis is not applicable to S(∞): for the former representation, decomposition into irreducibles is highly non–unique, and for the latter representation, there is no need of any decomposition at all. We start with constructing a compactification \(\mathfrak{S}\supset{S(\infty)}\), which we call the space of virtual permutations. Although \(\mathfrak{S}\) is no longer a group, it still admits a natural two–sided action of S(∞). Thus, \(\mathfrak{S}\) is a G–space, where G stands for the product of two copies of S(∞). On \(\mathfrak{S}\), there exists a unique G-invariant probability measure μ1, which has to be viewed as a “true” Haar measure for S(∞). More generally, we include μ1 into a family {μ
t
: t>0} of distinguished G-quasiinvariant probability measures on virtual permutations. By making use of these measures, we construct a family {T
z
: z∈ℂ} of unitary representations of G,
called generalized regular representations (each representation T
z
 with z≠=0 can be realized in the Hilbert space \(L^2(\mathfrak{S}, \mu_t)\), where t=|z|2). As |z|→∞, the generalized regular representations T
z
 approach, in a suitable sense, the “naive” two–sided regular representation of the group G in the space ℓ2(S(∞)). In contrast with the latter representation, the generalized regular representations T
z
 are highly reducible and have a rich structure. We prove that any T
z
 admits a (unique) decomposition into a multiplicity free continuous integral of irreducible representations of G. For any two distinct (and not conjugate) complex numbers z1, z2, the spectral types of the representations \(T_{z_1}\) and \(T_{z_2}\) are shown to be disjoint. In the case z∈ℤ, a complete description of the spectral type is obtained. Further work on the case z∈ℂ∖ℤ reveals a remarkable link with stochastic point processes and random matrix theory.

2706,Analysis of the equilibrium positions of nonlinear dynamical systems in the presence of coarse-graining disturbance in space,"Loosely speaking, a coarse-grained space is a space in which the generic point is not infinitely thin, but rather has a thickness; and here this feature is modelled as a space in which the generic increment is not dx, but rather (dx)α, 0<α<1. The purpose of the article is to analyze the non-linearity so induced by this coarse-graining effect. This approach via (dx)α leads us to the use of fractional analysis which so provides models in the form of nonlinear differential equations of fractional order. The purpose of the paper is to examine how the coarse-graining effect affects the equilibrium position of dynamical systems, and to this end, one uses the linearization technique on the one hand, and the Lyapunov function approach on the other hand in the framework of fractional analysis. It is shown that in some instances, the coarse-graining phenomenon can convert the initial stable system into an unstable system.",Guy Jumarie,Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computing,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12190-009-0254-5,"Coarse-grained space,Fractional analysis,Fractional Taylor’s series,Stability,Linearization,Lyapunov function"
2707,Analysis of quasi-optimal polynomial approximations for parameterized PDEs with deterministic and stochastic coefficients,"In this work, we present a generalized methodology for analyzing the convergence of quasi-optimal Taylor and Legendre approximations, applicable to a wide class of parameterized elliptic PDEs with finite-dimensional deterministic and stochastic inputs. Such methods construct an optimal index set that corresponds to the sharp estimates of the polynomial coefficients. Our analysis, furthermore, represents a novel approach for estimating best M-term approximation errors by means of coefficient bounds, without the use of the standard Stechkin inequality. In particular, the framework we propose for analyzing asymptotic truncation errors is based on an extension of the underlying multi-index set into a continuous domain, and then an approximation of the cardinality (number of integer multi-indices) by its Lebesgue measure. Several types of isotropic and anisotropic (weighted) multi-index sets are explored, and rigorous proofs reveal sharp asymptotic error estimates in which we achieve sub-exponential convergence rates [of the form \(M \text {exp}({-(\kappa M)^{1/N}})\), with \(\kappa \) a constant depending on the shape and size of multi-index sets] with respect to the total number of degrees of freedom. Through several theoretical examples, we explicitly derive the constant \(\kappa \) and use the resulting sharp bounds to illustrate the effectiveness of Legendre over Taylor approximations, as well as compare our rates of convergence with current published results. Computational evidence complements the theory and shows the advantage of our generalized framework compared to previously developed estimates","Hoang Tran1, Clayton G.

Riesz-Fischer theorem. Introduced by W. H. Young (1912), these theorems were considered and extended by F. Hausdorff (1923), F. Riesz (1923), E.C. Titchmarsh (1924), G. H. Hardy and J.E. Littlewood (1926), M. Riesz (1927), and O. Thorin (1939/48). Special emphasis is placed upon the development of the proofs of the two Hausdorff-Young inequalities and their impact upon Fourier analysis as a whole, in particular on the M. Riesz-Thorin convexity theoremand on the interpolation of operators. The golden thread connecting the various extensions and generalizations is the concept of logarithmic convexity, one that goes back to the work of J. Hadamard (1896), A. Liapounoff (1901), J.L.W.V.

2710,B{ä}cklund-Darboux Transformations and Melnikov Analysis for Davey-Stewartson II Equations," The Bäcklund-Darboux transformations are successfully utilized to construct heteroclinic orbits of Davey-Stewartson II equations through an elegant iteration of the transformations. In [17], we successfully built Melnikov vectors with the gradients of Floquet discriminants. Since there is no Floquet discriminant for Davey-Stewartson equations (in contrast to nonlinear Schrödinger equations [17]), the Melnikov vectors here are built with the novel idea of replacing the gradients of Floquet discriminants by quadratic products of Bloch functions. Such Melnikov vectors still maintain the properties of Poisson commuting with the gradient of the Hamiltonian and exponential decay as time approaches positive and negative infinities. This solves the problem of building Melnikov vectors for Davey-Stewartson equations without using the gradients of a Floquet discriminant. Melnikov functions for perturbed Davey-Stewartson II equations evaluated on the above heteroclinic orbits are built. ","Y.

2712,Computation of the maximum likelihood estimator in low-rank factor analysis,"Factor analysis is a classical multivariate dimensionality reduction technique popularly used in statistics, econometrics and data science. Estimation for factor analysis is often carried out via the maximum likelihood principle, which seeks to maximize the Gaussian likelihood under the assumption that the positive definite covariance matrix can be decomposed as the sum of a low-rank positive semidefinite matrix and a diagonal matrix with nonnegative entries. This leads to a challenging rank constrained nonconvex optimization problem, for which very few reliable computational algorithms are available. We reformulate the low-rank maximum likelihood factor analysis task as a nonlinear nonsmooth semidefinite optimization problem, study various structural properties of this reformulation; and propose fast and scalable algorithms based on difference of convex optimization. Our approach has computational guarantees, gracefully scales to large problems, is applicable to situations where the sample covariance matrix is rank deficient and adapts to variants of the maximum likelihood problem with additional constraints on the model parameters. Our numerical experiments validate the usefulness of our approach over existing state-of-the-art approaches for maximum likelihood factor analysis.","Koulik Khamaru1 & Rahul Mazumder

Through rigorous analysis and a numerical scheme of study, circumstances are specified under which the shared pathogen leads to the coexistence of the two-host species in either a persistent or periodic form. This study shows the importance of intrinsic growth rates or the differences between birth rates and death rates of the two host susceptibles in controlling these circumstances. It is also demonstrated that the periodicity may arise when the positive intrinsic growth rates are very small, but the periodicity is very weak which may not be observed in an empirical investigation.",Zhi-Min Chen1 & W.

First, we consider a new mathematical model in the form of fractional-order differential equations. In the proposed model, we apply the Caputo–Fabrizio fractional operator with exponential kernel. Then to solve the related equations, we suggest a quadratic numerical method and prove its stability and convergence. A deep investigation in the framework of time-domain response and phase-portrait shows that both the chaotic and nonchaotic behaviors of the considered system can be identified by the fractional-order mathematical model. Finally, we present a state-feedback controller and a chaos optimal control to overcome the system chaotic oscillations.

2720,A Limitation for Underestimation Via Twin Arithmetic,"Computing an enclosure for the range of a rational function over an interval is one of the main goals of interval analysis. One way to obtain such an enclosure is to use interval arithmetic evaluation of a formula for the function. Often one would like to check how close the overestimation is to the correct range. Kreinovich, Nesterov, and Zheludeva (Reliable Computing
2(2) (1996)) suggested a new kind of twin arithmetic which produces a twin of intervals at the same time: the usual enclosure, i.e., an interval which is an overestimation for the range, and an interval which is contained in the range, i.e. an interval which is an underestimation for the range. We show in this paper that in certain cases the computed inner interval is much smaller than the correct range. For example, if the function has the same value in the two endpoints of the interval then the inner interval is either empty or contains only one point.",Peter Hertling,Reliable Computing,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1011474231995,"Mathematical Modeling,Rational Function,Computational Mathematic,Industrial Mathematic,Interval Analysis"

n →R
m using rational operations and simple tests on real numbers. The topological structure of input point sets inR
n on which the computation follows the same execution path is studied. We also investigate input points, called sensitive, on which rounding errors may change the execution path followed.

The model, which consists of two delay differential equations with two fixed time lags is mainly studied for its dependency on varying connection strength between populations. Equilibria are identified, and using linear stability analysis, all transitions are determined under which both trivial and non-trivial fixed points lose stability.

2724,Analogy and duality of texture analysis by harmonics or indicators,"According to the classic harmonic approach, an orientation density function (odf)f is expanded into its corresponding Fourier orthogonal series with respect to generalized spherical harmonics, and a pole density function (pdf)\(\tilde P_h \) into its corresponding Fourier orthogonal series with respect to spherical harmonics. While pdfs are even (antipodally symmetric) functions, odfs are generally not. Therefore, the part\(\tilde \tilde f\) of the odf which cannot be determined from normal diffraction pdfs can be mathematically represented as the odd portion of its series expansion. If the odff is given, the even part\(\tilde f\) can be mathematically represented explicitly in terms off itself. Thus, it is possible to render maps ofharmonic orientation ghosts, and to evaluatevariants of mathematical standard odfs resulting in identical pdfs independent of pdf data. However, if only normal diffraction pdfs are known, the data-dependentvariation width of feasible odfs remained unaccessible, and within the harmonic approach a measure of confidence in a solution of the pdf-to-odf inversion problem does not exist.According to any discrete approach, an odff defined on some setG of orientations is expanded into its corresponding Fourier orthogonal series with respect to indicator functions of the elements of a partition ofG, and a pdf\(\tilde P_h \) defined on the upper (lower) unit hemisphereS

3+
⊂ℝ3 into its corresponding Fourier orthogonal series with respect to indicator functions of the elements of a partition ofS

3+
. The ambiguity of the pdf-to-odf inversion problem is discussed in terms of column-rank deficiency of the augmented projection matrix. The implication of the harmonic approach to split an odf into auniquely determined and anundetermined part does no longer seem to be reasonable. However, it is possible to numerically determine data-dependent confidence intervals for the Fourier coefficients with respect to the indicator functions which can be immediately interpreted as mean orientation densities within the elements of the partition ofG. Doing so for all Fourier coefficients in the finite series expansion, i.e. for all elements of the partition of the setG, eventually results in the data-dependent variation width of odfs feasible with respect to given pdf data, and to the partitions ofG andS

3+
.Thus it is confirmed that the appearance of orientation ghosts, in particular correlations oftrue andghost orientation components, depends on the representation of an odf. It may be questioned whether in practical applications the implicit assumption of the harmonic method that the even part\(\tilde f\) can be determined uniquely and free of error is generally a reasonable initial condition to develop ghost correction procedures.",H.

We take under consideration that only a susceptible person can be vaccinated and that the vaccine is not 100% efficient. The model is analyzed using stability theory of differential equations and numerical simulation. We have found a threshold condition, in terms of vaccination reproduction number \({\mathcal{R}_V}\) which is, if less than one, the disease dies out provided the vaccine efficacy is high enough, and otherwise the infection is maintained in the population. It is also shown that the spread of an infectious disease increases as the infective rate increases.","Xueyong Zhou1,2 & Zhen Guo",Arabian Journal of Mathematics,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40065-012-0013-6,"92B05,34D05"

Although this semi-discrete scheme is in general stable on cartesian grids, numerical calculations of spectra show that this can sometimes fail for generalizations of the Muscl method to unstructured three-dimensional grids. This motivates our investigation of the influence of the slope reconstruction method and stencil on the eigenvalue stability of the Muscl scheme. A theoretical stability analysis of the first order upwind scheme proves that this method is stable on arbitrary grids. In contrast, a general theoretical result is very difficult to obtain for the Muscl scheme. We are able to identify a local property of the slope reconstruction that is strongly related to the appearance of unstable eigenmodes. This property allows to identify the reconstruction methods that are best suited for stable discretizations. The explicit numerical computation of spectra for a large number of two- and three-dimensional test cases confirms and completes the theoretical results.","F. Haider1, J.-P. Croisille2 & B.

Due to which, some of the researchers tried to develop a three-way fuzzy concept lattice using neutrosophic set for characterization of uncertainty based on its acceptation, rejection, and uncertain parts, independently. In this process, a problem was addressed while processing the neutrosophic context based on user-required subset of attributes.

Nevertheless, it sometimes meets with one problem that the components of a system may have only few or even no samples, so that we cannot estimate their probability distributions via statistics. Then reliability analysis of a system based on uncertainty theory has been proposed. However, in a general system, some components of the system may have enough samples while some others may have no samples, so the reliability of the system cannot be analyzed simply based on probability theory or uncertainty theory. In order to deal with this type systems, this paper proposes a method of reliability analysis based on chance theory which is a generalization of both probability theory and uncertainty theory.

Currently Air traffic control (ATC) systems are heavily dependent upon human intervention at airport causing accidents and delays because of failure of communication. The purpose of this study is to develop, plan, manage and verify aircrafts movement procedures at the airport surface that prevent delays and collisions.MethodsThe airport surface is decomposed into blocks and represented by the graph relation. The state space of the system is described by identifying all the possible components of the system. The ground and local controls monitor queues of the aircrafts moving from taxiway to take-off. It is insured that once an aircraft is inserted into a queue, it is eventually removed from it after the next queue has become available. The take-off procedure is provided using graph theory and Vienna Development Method Specification Language (VDM-SL) and analyzed using VDM-SL toolbox.ResultsFormal specification of graph-based model, taxiways, aircrafts, runways and controllers is provided in static part of the model. The state space analysis describing take-off algorithms is provided by defining optimal paths and possible operations in dynamic model expediting the departure procedure. The model is developed by a series of refinements following the stepwise development approach.ConclusionsThe delays at airport surface require effective safety and guidance protocols to control air traffic at the airport. In static model, the safety criteria are described in terms of invariants over the data types carrying critical information. The safety is insured by defining pre/post conditions in description of operations for changing state space of the system.

Such a method is based on the maximum property of the quadratic form corresponding to a symmetric transformation in a finite dimensional subspace spanned by the firstn functions of a complete orthonormal set.In order to justify some numerical results, we also show that the transport operators are compact as acting both on the spaceC and on the spaceL

Moreover, we investigate some properties of the solution and we prove that the neutron distribution is not increasing as a function of the spatial coordinate.Finally, a series of calculations have been performed for various values of the system-dimensions measured in mean-free-paths and the number of secondaries per conllision to maintain the system critical has been found.","G.

For this a delay model is considered with nonlinear feedback oscillator defined in terms of Liénard oscillator description which can give rise to any one of the periodic orbits stated above. We have characterized the resonance and antiresonance behaviour for arbitrary nonlinear system from their stability and bifurcation analyses in reference to the standard delayed van der Pol system. An approximate analytical solution using Krylov–Bogoliubov (K–B) averaging method is utilised to recognize the sub-harmonic resonance and antiresonance, and average energy consumption per cycle. Direction of Hopf bifurcation and stability of the periodic solution bifurcating from the trivial fixed point are carried out using normal form and center manifold theory. The parametric excitation is also thoroughly investigated via bifurcation analysis to find the role of the control parameters like time delay, damping and nonlinear terms.","Sandip Saha

The paper has two parts: the first part investigates the case of a repeated circular convolution applied to m-dimensional polygons without normalization, and the second part investigates the more difficult case with normalization. We prove that if the normalized convolution is repeated sufficiently many times, then the limiting shape is that of a planar affine-regular polygon, inscribed in an ellipse, embedded in a 2-dimensional subspace of \(\mathbb {R}^m\), spanned by a basis specified by the principal harmonic components of the discrete Fourier transforms of the initial vectors of vertex coordinates. We provide a compact analytical description of the limiting elliptical form, as well as the limiting plane, using the language of circular convolutions and the tools of discrete Fourier analysis.

In theoretical studies, it is revealed that the PLL system fails to achieve the locking condition in the presence of small noise influences. For this reason, it is reasonable to accomplish noise analysis of the PLL system. In this paper, we accomplish the PLL noise analysis in coloured noise framework that is more general as well as confirms the real noise statistics in contrast to the white noise. The extended phase space and stochastic differential rules for the random state vector satisfying vector stochastic differential equation are exploited to accomplish the PLL coloured noise analysis. It is worthwhile to mention that the three concepts, non-linearity, stochasticity, multi-dimensionality, received attentions in applied mathematics literature. However, applications of these three mathematical concepts to engineering problems are relatively very scarce. More precisely, this paper accounts for non-linearity, non-Markovian stochasticity as well as multi-dimensionality in the noise analysis of the PLL dynamics. Since the non-linearity, multi-dimensionality are ubiquitous in real physical systems as well as stochasticity will set future research directions in applied mathematics, systems and control, this paper will have lasting influence on future stochastic problems.",Balaji G.

First, sufficient conditions of exponential stability for a class of uncertain time-delayed systems are established by employing Lyapunov functional methods and algebraic matrix inequality techniques. Furthermore, tracking control problems are investigated in which an uncertain linear time-delayed system is used to track the reference system. Sufficient conditions for solvability of tracking control problems are obtained for the cases that the system state is measurable and non-measurable, respectively. When the state is measurable, we design an impulsive control law to achieve the tracking performance. When the state information is not directly available from measurement, an impulsive control law based on the measured output will be used.

The proposed approach to calculation of the grammians lies in expanding them as the sums of the matrix bilinear or quadratic forms generated with the use of the Faddeev matrices and representing each the solution of the linear matrix algebraic equation corresponding to an individual matrix eigenvalue. A lemma was proved representing explicitly the finite and infinite grammians as the matrix exponents depending on the combined spectrum of the original matrices.

2760,The uniqueness of protein sequences: A Monte Carlo analysis,"Amino acid sequences have already been examined in some detail in order to relate them to structural aspects, homology and gene duplication. This report introduces the concept of internal uniqueness of tripeptides within protein sequences and uses the Monte Carlo method to study this property. Some idea of internal uniqueness may be obtained from such an analysis using only a single sequence if the probability of the random occurrence is about 0.001 or less. This method of analysis is similar to that used in quantitative evaluations of homology. When the probability of the random occurrence is larger than 0.001 a homologous group of sequences is required and the random probabilities may be compared with the real occurrences within the group. From such an examination insulin and cytochrome c are identified as protein sequences with high internal uniqueness.A comparison of data from internal uniqueness and gene duplication analyses shows that these two properties need not be related. Results of the analysis point to internal uniqueness as an additional parameter for inclusion in speculations on why twenty amino acids are coded in protein structure.",H. A. Saroff1 & F. A.

Exactly this dependence leads in practice to a huge gap between real and peak performance indicators, which is typical for all classes of computers from mobile devices to supercomputers of the highest performance range. It is this dependence that leads to a decrease in the quality of work of supercomputer centers and a drop in the efficiency of computer systems below a fraction of a percent. And at the same time, the fundamental nature of the problem itself determines two important facts. First, it is characteristic of all computer systems and centers of the world without exception. Second, practically all scientific groups of the world in all science areas conducting research using high-performance computing systems face this problem.","A. S. Antonov1, D. A. Nikitenko1 & Vl. V.

2764,"Seven pivotal theorems of Fourier analysis, signal analysis, numerical analysis and number theory: their interconnections","The present paper deals mainly with seven fundamental theorems of mathematical analysis, numerical analysis, and number theory, namely the generalized Parseval decomposition formula (GPDF), introduced 15 years ago, the well-known approximate sampling theorem (ASF), the new approximate reproducing kernel theorem, the basic Poisson summation formula, already known to Gauß, a newer version of the GPDF having a structure similar to that of the Poisson summation formula, namely, the Parseval decomposition–Poisson summation formula, the functional equation of Riemann’s zeta function, as well as the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula. It will in fact be shown that these seven theorems are all equivalent to one another, in the sense that each is a corollary of the others. Since these theorems can all be deduced from each other, one of them has to be proven independently in order to verify all. It is convenient to choose the ASF, introduced in 1963. The epilogue treats possible extensions to the more general contexts of reproducing kernel theory and of abstract harmonic analysis, using locally compact abelian groups. This paper is expository in the sense that it treats a number of mathematical theorems, their interconnections, their equivalence to one another. On the other hand, the proofs of the many intricate interconnections among these theorems are new in their essential steps and conclusions.","P. L. Butzer1, M. M. Dodson2, P. J. S. G. Ferreira3, J.

The case of inhomogeneous Pell inequalities it is equivalent to finding the integer lattice points in translated copies of a long and narrow tilted hyperbolic region with a quadratic irrational slope. We prove randomness in these natural lattice point counting problems. We have two main results: a central limit theorem (Theorem 2.1) and a law of the iterated logarithm (Theorem 2.2). The classical Circle Problem (counting lattice points in large circles) is a notoriously difficult open problem. What our results show is that the hyperbolic analog of the Circle Problem is solvable with striking precision.",József Beck,Periodica Mathematica Hungarica,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10998-014-0064-x,"Lattice point counting in specified regions,Discrepancy, Central limit theorem,Law of the iterated logarithm"

2767,Theoretical analyses on hydrodynamic instability in narrow deep river with variable curvature,"Bending river is the most common river type in nature, and it is also a typical example for river evolution. The transform of the flow pattern can affect the development of the riverbed form. In return, the variation in the riverbed form can affect the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow, thereby leading to the continuous evolution of the bending river. Based on this, a theoretical model for the bending river is established. The hydrodynamic instability characteristics of the laminar flow in the channel with a variable curvature, a typical model as the meandering river, are studied, and the variations of some parameters such as the curvature, the wave number, and the wave frequency are also discussed.","Haijue Xu1,2 & Yuchuan Bai1,",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-015-1971-6,"bending river,hydrodynamic stability,self-adaptability,nonlinear river dynamics"

We consider bounded TPN, whose underlying net is not necessarily bounded. We prove that our translation preserves the behavioral semantics of the TPN (the initial TPN and the obtained TA are proved timed-bisimilar). It allows us to check real-time properties on TPN by using the state class TA. This can be done efficiently thanks to a reduction of the number of clocks. We have implemented the method, and give some experimental results illustrating the efficiency of the translation algorithm in terms of number of clocks. Using the state class TA, we also give a framework for expressing and efficiently verifying TCTL properties on the initial TPN.","Didier Lime1,2 & Olivier H.

2771,"Fast, Efficient Equipment Placement Heuristics for Broadband Switched or Internet Router Networks","Planning and designing the next generation of IP router or switched broadband networks seems a daunting challenge considering the many complex, interacting factors affecting the performance and cost of such networks. Generally, this complexity implies that it may not even be clear what constitutes a “good” network design for a particular specification. Different network owners or operators may view the same solution differently, depending on their unique needs and perspectives. Nevertheless, we have observed a core common issue arising in the early stages of network design efforts involving leading-edge broadband switched technologies such as ATM, Frame Relay, and SMDS; or even Internet IP router networks. This core issue can be stated as follows: Given a set of service demands for the various network nodes, where should switching or routing equipment be placed to minimize the Installed First Cost of the network? Note that the specified service demands are usually projections for a future scenario and generally entail significant uncertainty. Despite this uncertainty, we have found that network owners and operators generally feel it is worthwhile to obtain high-level advice on equipment placement with a goal of minimizing Installed First Cost. This paper reports on a heuristic approach we have implemented for this problem that has evolved out of real network design projects. A tool with both a Solution Engine and an intuitive Graphical User Interface has been developed. The approach is highly efficient; for example, the tool can often handle LATA-sized networks in seconds or less on a workstation processor. By using only nodal demands rather than the more complex point-to-point demands usually required in tools of this sort, we have created an approach that is not only highly efficient, but is also a better match to real design projects in which demand data is generally scant and highly uncertain.",Joel W.

2772,"Theory of evidence — A survey of its mathematical foundations, applications and computational aspects","The mathematical theory of evidence has been introduced by Glenn Shafer in 1976 as a new approach to the representation of uncertainty. This theory can be represented under several distinct but more or less equivalent forms. Probabilistic interpretations of evidence theory have their roots in Arthur Dempster's multivalued mappings of probability spaces. This leads to random set and more generally to random filter models of evidence. In this probabilistic view evidence is seen as more or less probable arguments for certain hypotheses and they can be used to support those hypotheses to certain degrees. These degrees of support are in fact the reliabilities with which the hypotheses can be derived from the evidence. Alternatively, the mathematical theory of evidence can be founded axiomatically on the notion of belief functions or on the allocation of belief masses to subsets of a frame of discernment. These approaches aim to present evidence theory as an extension of probability theory. Evidence theory has been used to represent uncertainty in expert systems, especially in the domain of diagnostics. It can be applied to decision analysis and it gives a new perspective for statistical analysis. Among its further applications are image processing, project planning and scheduling and risk analysis. The computational problems of evidence theory are well understood and even though the problem is complex, efficient methods are available.",Jürg Kohlas1 & Paul-André Monney,Zeitschrift für Operations Research,1994,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01440734,"Uncertainty,Evidence,Dempster-Shafer Theory,Belief Functions"
2773,Differentiability of quasiconvex functions on separable Banach spaces,"We investigate the differentiability properties of a real-valued quasiconvex function f defined on a separable Banach space X. Continuity is only assumed to hold at the points of a dense subset. If so, this subset is automatically residual.Sample results that can be quoted without involving any new concept or nomenclature are as follows: (i) If f is usc or strictly quasiconvex, then f is Hadamard differentiable at the points of a dense subset of X. (ii) If f is even, then f is continuous and Gâteaux differentiable at the points of a dense subset of X. In (i) or (ii), the dense subset need not be residual but, if X is also reflexive, it contains the complement of a Haar null set. Furthermore, (ii) remains true without the evenness requirement if the definition of Gâteaux differentiability is generalized in an unusual, but ultimately natural, way.The full results are much more general and substantially stronger. In particular, they incorporate the well known theorem of Crouzeix, to the effect that every real-valued quasiconvex function on ℝN is Fréchet differentiable a.e.",Patrick J.

Next to the mechanical components such as strain and displacements, the model accounts for biological constituents such as the concentration of signaling molecules, the cellular densities of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, and the density of collagen. Here we present stability constraints for the one-dimensional counterpart of this morphoelastic model, for both the continuous and (semi-) discrete problem. We show that the truncation error between these eigenvalues associated with the continuous and semi-discrete problem is of order \({{\mathcal {O}}}(h^2)\). Next we perform numerical validation to these constraints and provide a biological interpretation of the (in)stability. For the mechanical part of the model, the results show the components reach equilibria in a (non) monotonic way, depending on the value of the viscosity. The results show that the parameters of the chemical part of the model need to meet the stability constraint, depending on the decay rate of the signaling molecules, to avoid unrealistic results.","Ginger Egberts

2791,Reducible M-curves for Le-networks in the totally-nonnegative Grassmannian and KP-II multiline solitons,"We associate real and regular algebraic–geometric data to each multi-line soliton solution of Kadomtsev–Petviashvili II (KP) equation. These solutions are known to be parametrized by points of the totally non-negative part of real Grassmannians \(Gr^{\mathrm{TNN}}(k,n)\). In [3] we were able to construct real algebraic–geometric data for soliton data in the main cell \(Gr^{\mathrm{TP}} (k,n)\) only. Here we do not just extend that construction to all points in \(Gr^{\mathrm{TNN}}(k,n)\), but we also considerably simplify it, since both the reducible rational \(\texttt {M}\)-curve \(\Gamma \) and the real regular KP divisor on \(\Gamma \) are directly related to the parametrization of positroid cells in \(Gr^{\mathrm{TNN}}(k,n)\) via the Le-networks introduced in [63]. In particular, the direct relation of our construction to the Le-networks guarantees that the genus of the underlying smooth \(\texttt {M}\)-curve is minimal and it coincides with the dimension of the positroid cell in \(Gr^{\mathrm{TNN}}(k,n)\) to which the soliton data belong to.

 I for R is a discretely ordered subring such that for every \({r \in R}\) , there exists an \({i \in I}\) so that i ≤ r < i + 1. Mourgues and Ressayre (J Symb Logic 58:641–647, 1993) showed that every real closed field has an integer part. The procedure of Mourgues and Ressayre appears to be quite complicated. We would like to know whether there is a simple procedure, yielding an integer part that is \({\Delta^0_2(R)}\) —limit computable relative to R. We show that there is a maximal Z-ring \({I \subseteq R}\) which is \({\Delta^0_2(R)}\) . However, this I may not be an integer part for R. By a result of Wilkie (Logic Colloquium ’77), any Z-ring can be extended to an integer part for some real closed field. Using Wilkie’s ideas, we produce a real closed field R with a Z-ring \({I \subseteq R}\) such that I does not extend to an integer part for R. For a computable real closed field, we do not know whether there must be an integer part in the class \({\Delta^0_2}\) . We know that certain subclasses of \({\Delta^0_2}\) are not sufficient. We show that for each \({n \in \omega}\) , there is a computable real closed field with no n-c.e. integer part. In fact, there is a computable real closed field with no n-c.e. integer part for any n.","Paola D’Aquino2, Julia Knight1 & Karen Lange",Archive for Mathematical Logic,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00153-011-0241-z,"Integer part,Real closed field,

2793,Fourier–Mellin Transforms for Circular Domains,"Generalized Fourier–Mellin transforms for analytic functions defined in simply connected circular domains are derived. Circular domains are taken to be those with boundaries that are a finite union of circular arcs, including straight line edges. The results are an extension to circular domains of the generalized Fourier transforms for convex polygons (having only straight line edges) derived by Fokas and Kapaev (IMA J Appl Math 68:355–408, 2003). First, a new, elementary derivation of the latter result for polygons is given based on Cauchy’s integral formula and a spectral representation of the Cauchy kernel. This rederivation extends in a natural way to the case of circular domains once an adapted spectral representation of the Cauchy kernel is established. Domains with boundaries that are a combination of circular arc and straight line edges can be treated similarly. The newly derived transforms are generalizations of the classical Fourier and Mellin transforms to general circular domains. It is shown by example how they can be used to solve boundary value problems for Laplace’s equation in such domains. The notions of spectral matrix and fundamental contour, which arise naturally in the formulation, are also introduced.",Darren Crowdy,Computational Methods and Function Theory,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40315-015-0139-6,"Transform method,Circular domains,Fourier transform,Mellin transform"
2794,Automatically Discovering Relaxed Lyapunov Functions for Polynomial Dynamical Systems,"The notion of Lyapunov function plays a key role in the design and verification of dynamical systems, as well as hybrid and cyber-physical systems. In this paper, to analyze the asymptotic stability of a dynamical system, we generalize standard Lyapunov functions to relaxed Lyapunov functions (RLFs), by considering higher order Lie derivatives. Furthermore, we present a method for automatically discovering polynomial RLFs for polynomial dynamical systems (PDSs). Our method is relatively complete in the sense that it is able to discover all polynomial RLFs with a given predefined template for any PDS. Therefore it can also generate all polynomial RLFs for the PDS by enumerating all polynomial templates.","Jiang Liu1, Naijun Zhan2 & Hengjun Zhao",Mathematics in Computer Science,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11786-012-0133-6,"Polynomial dynamical system,Asymptotic stability,Lyapunov function,Higher order Lie derivative"

The considered failures are changes on holding times or tokens of the TEG places that can provoke shifts between an observed outcoming timed flow and an expected outcoming timed flow (for a given incoming timed flow). Indicators are built to first detect such shifts relying on the \((\max \limits ,+)\) algebraic framework and the residuation theory. An analysis of the indicators’ values provides information about time or event failure that could have happen. Then, thanks to the knowledge of the behavior of the system through its corresponding TEG, sets of failures that could explain the detected shifts are obtained. It comes from matrices of signatures for each indicator built on each observable output of the system. An example of application is proposed to experiment exhaustively failures of type time and event on each place of the TEG.","Euriell Le Corronc

2797,Fokas Diagonalization of Piecewise Constant Coefficient Linear Differential Operators on Finite Intervals and Networks,"We describe a new form of diagonalization for linear two point constant coefficient differential operators with arbitrary linear boundary conditions. Although the diagonalization is in a weaker sense than that usually employed to solve initial boundary value problems (IBVP), we show that it is sufficient to solve IBVP whose spatial parts are described by such operators. We argue that the method described may be viewed as a reimplementation of the Fokas transform method for linear evolution equations on the finite interval. The results are extended to multipoint and interface operators, including operators defined on networks of finite intervals, in which the coefficients of the differential operator may vary between subintervals, and arbitrary interface and boundary conditions may be imposed; differential operators with piecewise constant coefficients are thus included. Both homogeneous and inhomogeneous problems are solved.","Sultan Aitzhan1, Sambhav Bhandari2 & David A. Smith

2798,The dynamics of density dependent population models,The dynamics of density-dependent population models can be extraordinarily complex as numerous authors have displayed in numerical simulations. Here we commence a theoretical analysis of the mathematical mechanisms underlying this complexity from the viewpoint of modern dynamical systems theory. After discussing the chaotic behavior of one-dimensional difference equations we proceed to illustrate the general theory on a density-dependent Leslie model with two age classes. The pattern of bifurcations away from the equilibrium point is investigated and the existence of a “strange attractor” is demonstrated — i.e. an attracting limit set which is neither an equilibrium nor a limit cycle. Near the strange attractor the system exhibits essentially random behavior. An approach to the statistical analysis of the dynamics in the chaotic regime is suggested. We then generalize our conclusions to higher dimensions and continuous models (e.g. the nonlinear von Foerster equation).," J. Guckenheimer1,  G. Oster2 &  A.

The stylized facts surveyed in this paper shed new light on the market structure that appears composed of heterogeneous  agents. It also poses several challenges such as the definition of price and of the time-scale, the concepts of risk and efficiency, the modeling of the markets and the learning process.

In addition, we note that the stability conceptions of Lyapunov and Levi-Civita are also important in this transition from the appearance of the first qualitative tools in the study of differential equations to the definition of stability in use in dynamical systems theory.

2810,Race to idle or not: balancing the memory sleep time with DVS for energy minimization,"Reducing energy consumption is a critical problem in most of the computing systems today. Among all the computing system components, processor and memory are two significant energy consumers. Dynamic voltage scaling is typically applied to reduce processor energy while sleep mode is usually injected to trim memory’s leakage energy. However, in the memory architecture with multiple cores sharing memory, in order to optimize the system-wide energy, these two classic techniques are difficult to be directly combined due to the complicated interactions. In this work, we explore the coordination of the multiple cores and the memory, and present systematic analysis for minimizing the system-wide energy based on different system models and task models. For tasks with common release time, optimal schemes are presented for the systems both with and without considering the static power of the cores. For agreeable deadline tasks, different dynamic programming-based optimal solutions are proposed for negligible and non-negligible static power of cores. For the general task model, this paper proposes a heuristic online algorithm. Furthermore, the scheme is extended to handle the problem when the transition overhead between the active and sleep modes is considered. The optimality of the proposed schemes for common release time and agreeable deadline tasks are proved. The validity of the proposed heuristic scheme is evaluated through experiments. Experimental results confirm the superiority of the heuristic scheme in terms of the energy saving improvement compared to the most related existing work.","Chenchen Fu1, Vincent Chau1,2, Minming Li1 & …Chun Jason Xue",Journal of Combinatorial Optimization,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10878-017-0229-7,"Schedule algorithm,Multi-core processor,Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS),Energy efficiency,Main memory"

2812,On the eigenvalues of the Robin Laplacian with a complex parameter,"We study the spectrum of the Robin Laplacian with a complex Robin parameter \(\alpha \) on a bounded Lipschitz domain \(\Omega \). We start by establishing a number of properties of the corresponding operator, such as generation properties, analytic dependence of the eigenvalues and eigenspaces on \(\alpha \in {\mathbb {C}}\), and basis properties of the eigenfunctions. Our focus, however, is on bounds and asymptotics for the eigenvalues as functions of \(\alpha \): we start by providing estimates on the numerical range of the associated operator, which lead to new eigenvalue bounds even in the case \(\alpha \in {\mathbb {R}}\). For the asymptotics of the eigenvalues as \(\alpha \rightarrow \infty \) in \({\mathbb {C}}\), in place of the min–max characterisation of the eigenvalues and Dirichlet–Neumann bracketing techniques commonly used in the real case, we exploit the duality between the eigenvalues of the Robin Laplacian and the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. We use this to show that along every analytic curve of eigenvalues, the Robin eigenvalues either diverge absolutely in \({\mathbb {C}}\) or converge to the Dirichlet spectrum, as well as to classify all possible points of accumulation of Robin eigenvalues for large \(\alpha \). We also give a comprehensive treatment of the special cases where \(\Omega \) is an interval, a hyperrectangle or a ball. This leads to the conjecture that on a general smooth domain in dimension \(d\ge 2\) all eigenvalues converge to the Dirichlet spectrum if \({\mathrm{Re}}\,\alpha \) remains bounded from below as \(\alpha \rightarrow \infty \), while if \({\mathrm{Re}}\,\alpha \rightarrow -\infty \), then there is a family of divergent eigenvalue curves, each of which behaves asymptotically like \(-\alpha ^2\).

We prove, in exact arithmetic, that any type of residual norm convergence obtained using BiCG can also be obtained using FOM but on a different system of equations. We consider practical comparisons of these procedures when they are applied to the same matrices. We use a unitary invariance shared by both methods, to construct test matrices where we can vary the nonnormality of the test matrix by variations in simplified eigenvector matrices. We used these test problems in two sets of numerical experiments. The first set of experiments was designed to study effects of increasing nonnormality on the convergence of GMRES and QMR. The second set of experiments was designed to track effects of the eigenvalue distribution on the convergence of QMR. In these tests the GMRES residual norms decreased significantly more rapidly than the QMR residual norms but without corresponding decreases in the error norms. Furthermore, as the nonnormality ofA was increased, the GMRES residual norms decreased more rapidly. This led to premature termination of the GMRES procedure on highly nonnormal problems. On the nonnormal test problems the QMR residual norms exhibited less sensitivity to changes in the nonnormality. The convergence of either type of procedure, as measured by the error norms, was delayed by the presence of large or small outliers and affected by the type of eigenvalues, real or complex, in the eigenvalue distribution ofA. For GMRES this effect can be seen only in the error norm plots.",Jane Cullum,Advances in Computational Mathematics,1996,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02127693,"Numerical Experiment,Iterative Method,Test Problem,Error Norm,Premature Termination"
2818,A survey on direct solvers for Galerkin methods,"In this paper we describe the history, performance, and design concepts of direct solvers for algebraic systems resulting from Galerkin discretizations of partial differential equations. Popular direct solver implementations of Gaussian elimination (also known as LU factorization) are introduced and briefly analyzed. We discuss three of the most relevant aspects influencing the performance of direct solvers on this kind of algebraic systems. First, the ordering of the degrees of freedom of the algebraic system has a significant impact on the solver performance, solution speed and memory requirements. The impact of unknowns ordering for elimination is exemplified and alternative ordering algorithms are described and compared. Second, the effect of round-off error on the simulation results is discussed. We detail this effect for uniform grids where the impact of round-off error on the solution is controlled by the condition number of the matrix in terms of the element size, but is independent of the polynomial order of approximation. Additionally, we discuss the link between unknown ordering and round-off error. Third, we describe the impact of the connectivity pattern (graph) of the basis functions on the performance of direct solvers. Variations in the connectivity structure of the resulting discrete system have severe impact on performance of the solver. That is, the resources needed to factorize the system strongly depend on its connectivity graph. Less connected graphs are cheaper to solve, that is, C0 finite element discretizations are cheaper to solve with direct solvers than Cp−1 discretizations.","David Pardo1,2, Maciej Paszynski3, Nathan Collier4, Julen Alvarez1, Lisandro Dalcin5 & …Victor M.

2820,ParEGO extensions for multi-objective optimization of expensive evaluation functions,"This paper deals with multi-objective optimization in the case of expensive objective functions. Such a problem arises frequently in engineering applications where the main purpose is to find a set of optimal solutions in a limited global processing time. Several algorithms use linearly combined criteria to use directly mono-objective algorithms. Nevertheless, other algorithms, such as multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) and model-based algorithms, propose a strategy based on Pareto dominance to optimize efficiently all criteria. A widely used model-based algorithm for multi-objective optimization is Pareto efficient global optimization (ParEGO). It combines linearly the objective functions with several random weights and maximizes the expected improvement (EI) criterion. However, this algorithm tends to favor parameter values suitable for the reduction of the surrogate model error, rather than finding non-dominated solutions. The contribution of this article is to propose an extension of the ParEGO algorithm for finding the Pareto Front by introducing a double Kriging strategy. Such an innovation allows to calculate a modified EI criterion that jointly accounts for the objective function approximation error and the probability to find Pareto Set solutions.

We establish algebraic criteria for the existence of left invariant metrics g on G such that each eigenspace of \(\Delta _g\), regarded as the real vector space of the corresponding real eigenfunctions, is irreducible under the action of G. We prove that generic left invariant metrics on the Lie groups \(G={ SU}(2)\times \cdots \times { SU}(2)\times T\), where T is a (possibly trivial) torus, have the property just described. The same holds for quotients of such groups G by discrete central subgroups.

This operation, together with the ordinary multiplication of complex numbers, satisfies axioms that generalize the standard field axioms. The algebraic geometry over a complex tropical hyperfield thus defined occupies an intermediate position between the classical complex algebraic geometry and tropical geometry. A deformation similar to the Litvinov-Maslov dequantization of real numbers leads to the degeneration of complex algebraic varieties into complex tropical varieties, whereas the amoeba of a complex tropical variety turns out to be the corresponding tropical variety. Similar tropical modifications with multivalued additions are constructed for other fields as well: for real numbers, p-adic numbers, and quaternions.","O. Ya.

2828,Trade and Resource Sustainability with Asset Markets,"Trade changes incentives to protect an open-access natural resource independently of its effect on the resource price. General equilibrium linkages cause resource policy to affect the price of privately owned assets regardless of whether they are used in the resource sector. In the closed economy, the asset market in our overlapping generations setting creates incentives for currently living agents to protect the natural resource. The interplay of the asset market and general equilibrium effects causes trade to reverse these incentives. Trade liberalization and the establishment of formal property rights are policy complements: the former makes the latter more important.

Cones of directions of decrease, cones of feasible directions and a cone of tangent directions, as well as, a new cone of directions of nonincrease play an important role here. The dual cones to the cones of direction of decrease and to the cones of directions of nonincrease are characterized for convex functionals without differentiability, with the aid of their subdifferential, making the optimality theorems applicable. The theory is applied to vector mathematical programming, giving a generalized Fritz John theorem, and other applications are mentioned.

2836,On classical systems and measurements in quantum mechanics,"The recent rigorous derivation of the Born rule from the dynamical law of quantum mechanics Allahverdyan et al. (Phys Rep 525:1–166. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2012.11.001, 2013) is taken as incentive to reexamine whether quantum mechanics has to be an inherently probabilistic theory. It is shown, as an existence proof, that an alternative perspective on quantum mechanics is possible where the fundamental ontological element, the ket, is not probabilistic in nature and in which the Born rule can also be derived from the dynamics. The probabilistic phenomenology of quantum mechanics follows from a new definition of statistical state in the form of a probability measure on the Hilbert space of kets that is a replacement for the von Neumann statistical operator to address the lack of uniqueness in recovering the pure states included in mixed states, as was pointed out by Schrödinger. From the statistical state of a quantum system, classical variables are defined as collective variables with negligible dispersion. In this framework, classical variables can be chosen to define a derived classical system that obeys, by Ehrenfest’s theorem, the laws of classical mechanics and that describes the macroscopic behavior of the quantum system. The Born rule is derived from the dynamics of the statistical state of the quantum system composed of the observed system interacting with the measurement system and the role of the derived classical system in the process is exhibited. The approach suggests to formulate physical systems in second quantization in terms of local quantum fields to ensure conceptually equivalent treatment of space and time. A real double-slit experiment, as opposed to a thought experiment, is studied in detail to illustrate the measurement process.","Erik Deumens

2839,Exact Minkowski Products of N Complex Disks,"An exact parameterization for the boundary of the Minkowski product of N circular disks in the complex plane is derived. When N > 2, this boundary curve may be regarded as a generalization of the Cartesian oval that bounds the Minkowski product of two disks. The derivation is based on choosing a system of coordinated polar representations for the N operands, identifying sets of corresponding points with matched logarithmic Gauss map that may contribute to the Minkowski product boundary. By means of inversion in the operand circles, a geometrical characterization for their corresponding points is derived, in terms of intersections with the circles of a special coaxal system. The resulting parameterization is expressed as a product of N terms, each involving the radius of one disk, a single square root, and the sine and cosine of a common angular variable ϕ over a prescribed domain. As a special case, the N-th Minkowski power of a single disk is bounded by a higher trochoid. In certain applications, the availability of exact Minkowski products is a useful alternative to the naive bounding approximations that are customarily employed in ""complex circular arithmetic.""",Rida T.

In this paper, we will review some of its various properties and uses.The paper is divided into four parts and, altogether, 12 sections. In the first part, we introduce a standardized scheme for classifying those dissimilarity mappings to which the Farris transform can be applied—a scheme that has evolved over the years, but has apparently not been spelled out before in sufficient detail. In the second part, we will discuss how a straightforward generalization of the Farris transform naturally arises in T-Theory.

2850,Duality for Frames,"The subject of this article is the duality principle, which, well beyond its stand at the heart of Gabor analysis, is a universal principle in frame theory that gives insight into many phenomena. Its fiber matrix formulation for Gabor systems is the driving principle behind seemingly different results. We show how the classical duality identities, operator representations and constructions for dual Gabor frames are in fact aspects of the dual Gramian matrix fiberization and its sole duality principle, giving a unified view to all of them. We show that the same duality principle, via dual Gramian matrix analysis, holds for dual (or bi-) systems in abstract Hilbert spaces. The essence of the duality principle is the unitary equivalence of the frame operator and the Gramian of certain adjoint systems. An immediate consequence is, for example, that, even on this level of generality, dual frames are characterized in terms of biorthogonality relations of adjoint systems. We formulate the duality principle for irregular Gabor systems which have no structure whatsoever to the sampling of the shifts and modulations of the generating window. In case the shifts and modulations are sampled from lattices we show how the abstract matrices can be reduced to the simple structured fiber matrices of shift-invariant systems, thus arriving back in the well understood territory. Moreover, in the arena of multiresolution analysis (MRA)-wavelet frames, the mixed unitary extension principle can be viewed as the duality principle in a sequence space. This perspective leads to a construction scheme for dual wavelet frames which is strikingly simple in the sense that it only needs the completion of an invertible constant matrix. Under minimal conditions on the MRA, our construction guarantees the existence and easy constructability of non-separable multivariate dual MRA-wavelet frames. The wavelets have compact support and we show examples for multivariate interpolatory refinable functions. Finally, we generalize the duality principle to the case of transforms that are no longer defined by discrete systems, but may have discrete adjoint systems.","Zhitao Fan1, Andreas Heinecke1 & Zuowei Shen",Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00041-015-9415-0,"Dual frame,Adjoint system,Duality principle,Wavelets, Gabor frame,Dual Gramian analysis,Filter bank"

This implies the need to integrate the naturally distributed data sources with large simulation engines offering parallel low latency communication and so to integrate parallel and Grid computing paradigms. We start with an overview of these and the evolving service architectures. We illustrate the identified areas of interest for Algorithms and the Grid with the specific example of SERVOGrid that supports earthquake science research.

This is here illustrated on some examples. On this basis, De Giorgi’s notion of Γ-convergence is then applied to the analysis of monotone inclusions, like \({D_tu + \alpha(u)\ni h}\) .

In spite of early interest, in recent years relatively little research using this method has been published, perhaps because the JPG method is rarely explained in its totality and when it is, the descriptions are often inconsistent or unclear. Although it is now embedded in several software programs and its use may be more widespread, it is no better understood and after processing there is a marked lack of consistency in how the results are interpreted. This paper provides a historical background for the development of the JPG and a discussion of its conceptual or theoretical origins, followed by a “worked example” of the mathematics of the JPG. In combination with the results for two further cases, the paper identifies some important interpretative limits in the method and uses the examples to explain its potential use in design analysis. Finally, the paper discusses how the consistent application of this method to sets of related buildings is likely to produce a more valuable, and statistically viable, basis for future work.",Michael J.

2857,On Closures of Preimages of Metric Projection Mappings in Hilbert Spaces,"The closure of preimages (inverse images) of metric projection mappings to a given set in a Hilbert space are investigated. In particular, some properties of fibers over singletons (level sets or preimages of singletons) of the metric projection are provided. One of them, a sufficient condition for the convergence of minimizing sequence for a giving point, ensures the convergence of a subsequence of minimizing points, thus the limit of the subsequence belongs to the image of the metric projection. Several examples preserving this sufficient condition are provided. It is also shown that the set of points for which the sufficient condition can be applied is dense in the boundary of the preimage of each set from a large class of subsets of the Hilbert space. As an application of obtained properties of preimages we show that if the complement of a nonconvex set is a countable union of preimages of convex closed sets then there is a point such that the value of the metric projection mapping is not a singleton. It is also shown that the Klee result, stating that only convex closed sets can be weakly closed Chebyshev sets, can be obtained for locally weakly closed sets.",Dariusz Zagrodny,Set-Valued and Variational Analysis,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11228-015-0350-7,"Inverse mapping of metric projection,Chebyshev sets,Best approximation,Convexity,Differentiability of the distance function,Concavity of the distance function"

2859,"Regularization by Free Additive Convolution, Square and Rectangular Cases","The free convolution \(\boxplus\) is the binary operation on the set of probability measures on the real line which allows to deduce, from the individual spectral distributions, the spectral distribution of a sum of independent unitarily invariant square random matrices or of a sum of free operators in a non commutative probability space. In the same way, the rectangular free convolution \(\boxplus_{\lambda}\) allows to deduce, from the individual singular distributions, the singular distribution of a sum of independent unitarily invariant rectangular random matrices. In this paper, we consider the regularization properties of these free convolutions on the whole real line. More specifically, we try to find continuous semigroups (μ
t
) of probability measures such that μ0 = δ0 and such that for all t > 0 and all probability measure \(\nu, \mu_t\boxplus\nu\) (or, in the rectangular context, \(\mu_t\boxplus_{\lambda}\nu\)) is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, with a positive analytic density on the whole real line. In the square case, for \(\boxplus\), we prove that in semigroups satisfying this property, no measure can have a finite second moment, and we give a sufficient condition on semigroups to satisfy this property, with examples. In the rectangular case, we prove that in most cases, for μ in a \(\boxplus_{\lambda}\)-continuous semigroup, \(\mu\boxplus_{\lambda}\nu\) either has an atom at the origin or doesn’t put any mass in a neighborhood of the origin, and thus the expected property does not hold. However, we give sufficient conditions for analyticity of the density of \(\mu\boxplus_{\lambda}\nu\) except on a negligible set of points, as well as existence and continuity of a density everywhere.","Serban T.

In an influential paper, Lebowitz et al. (J Stat Phys 50(3–4):657–687, 1988) proposed a critical mass threshold given by the mass of the ground state on the real line. We provide a proof for the optimality of this critical mass threshold. The proof also applies to the two-dimensional radial problem posed on the unit disc. In this case, we answer a question posed by Bourgain and Bulut (Ann Inst H Poincaré Anal Non Linéaire 31(6):1267–1288, 2014) on the optimal mass threshold. Furthermore, in the one-dimensional case, we show that the Gibbs measure is indeed normalizable at the optimal mass threshold, thus answering an open question posed by Lebowitz et al. (1988). This normalizability at the optimal mass threshold is rather striking in view of the minimal mass blowup solution for the focusing quintic nonlinear Schrödinger equation on the one-dimensional torus.","Tadahiro Oh1,2, Philippe Sosoe3 & Leonardo Tolomeo1,2,",Inventiones mathematicae,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-021-01080-y,"60H40,60H30,35Q55"

2864,Continuous and Smooth Envelopes of Topological Algebras. Part 1,"Since the first optical instruments were invented, an idea that the visible image of an object under observation depends on tools of observation became commonly assumed in physics. A way of formalizing this idea in mathematics is the construction that assigns to an arbitrary object A in a category K its envelope \( {\mathrm{Env}}_{\Phi}^{\Omega}A \) in a given class of morphisms (a class of representations) Ω with respect to a given class of morphisms (a class of observation tools) Φ. It turns out that if we take a sufficiently wide category of topological algebras as K, then each choice of the classes Ω and Φ defines a “projection of functional analysis into geometry,” and the standard “geometric disciplines,” like complex geometry, differential geometry, and topology, become special cases of this construction. This gives a formal scheme of “categorical construction of geometries” with many interesting applications, in particular, “geometric generalizations of the Pontryagin duality” (to the classes of noncommutative groups). In this paper we describe this scheme in topology and in differential geometry.",S. S.

2865,Global theory of one-frequency Schrödinger operators,"We study Schrödinger operators with a one-frequency analytic potential, focusing on the transition between the two distinct local regimes characteristic respectively of large and small potentials. From the dynamical point of view, the transition signals the emergence of non-uniform hyperbolicity, so the dependence of the Lyapunov exponent with respect to parameters plays a central role in the analysis. Though often ill-behaved by conventional measures, we show that the Lyapunov exponent is in fact remarkably regular in a “stratified sense” which we define: the irregularity comes from the matching of nice (analytic or smooth) functions along sets with complicated geometry. This result allows us to establish that the “critical set” for the transition lies within countably many codimension one subvarieties of the (infinite-dimensional) parameter space. A more refined renormalization-based analysis shows that the critical set is rather thin within those subvarieties, and allows us to conclude that a typical potential has no critical energies. Such acritical potentials also form an open set and have several interesting properties: only finitely many “phase transitions” may happen, but never at any specific point in the spectrum, and the Lyapunov exponent is minorated in the region of the spectrum where it is positive. On the other hand, we do show that the number of phase transitions can be arbitrarily large.Key to our approach are two results about the dependence of the Lyapunov exponent of one-frequency SL\({(2,\mathbb{C})}\) cocycles with respect to perturbations in the imaginary direction: on one hand there is a severe “quantization” restriction, and on the other hand “regularity” of the dependence characterizes uniform hyperbolicity when the Lyapunov exponent is positive. Our method is independent of arithmetic conditions on the frequency.","Artur Avila1,",Acta Mathematica,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11511-015-0128-7,"symplectic diffeomorphisms,partial hyperbolicity,Lyapunov exponents,generic properties"

The indirect one, partially described by Vignola, is based on the use of pre-designed cartoons on the ground.

Both the ceiling painting of the Church of San Matteo in Pisa and the parietal one of the Church of S. Caterina in Livorno show, even if observed from the privileged viewpoints, some irregularities.

We also study the leaders in the prime number race, obtaining asymptotic formulae for logarithmic densities when the number of competitors can be as large as a power of q, whereas previous methods could only allow a power of \(\log q\). The proofs use harmonic analysis related to the Hardy–Littlewood circle method to control the average size of correlations in prime number races. They also use various probabilistic tools, including an exchangeable pairs version of Stein’s method, normal comparison tools, and conditioning arguments.

2876,Decorated merge trees for persistent topology,"This paper introduces decorated merge trees (DMTs) as a novel invariant for persistent spaces. DMTs combine both \(\pi _0\) and \(H_n\) information into a single data structure that distinguishes filtrations that merge trees and persistent homology cannot distinguish alone. Three variants on DMTs, which emphasize category theory, representation theory and persistence barcodes, respectively, offer different advantages in terms of theory and computation. Two notions of distance—an interleaving distance and bottleneck distance—for DMTs are defined and a hierarchy of stability results that both refine and generalize existing stability results is proved here. To overcome some of the computational complexity inherent in these distances, we provide a novel use of Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to compute optimal merge tree alignments for a combinatorial version of our interleaving distance which can be tractably estimated. We introduce computational frameworks for generating, visualizing and comparing decorated merge trees derived from synthetic and real data. Example applications include comparison of point clouds, interpretation of persistent homology of sliding window embeddings of time series, visualization of topological features in segmented brain tumor images and topology-driven graph alignment.

2880,A Structural Classification of Candidate Oscillatory and Multistationary Biochemical Systems,"Molecular systems are uncertain: The variability of reaction parameters and the presence of unknown interactions can weaken the predictive capacity of solid mathematical models. However, strong conclusions on the admissible dynamic behaviors of a model can often be achieved without detailed knowledge of its specific parameters. In systems with a sign-definite Jacobian, for instance, cycle-based criteria related to the famous Thomas’ conjectures have been largely used to characterize oscillatory and multistationary dynamic outcomes. We build on the rich literature focused on the identification of potential oscillatory and multistationary behaviors using parameter-free criteria. We propose a classification for sign-definite non-autocatalytic biochemical networks, which summarizes several existing results in the literature. We call weak (strong) candidate oscillators systems which can possibly (exclusively) transition to instability due to the presence of a complex pair of eigenvalues, while we call weak (strong) candidate multistationary systems those which can possibly (exclusively) transition to instability due to the presence of a real eigenvalue. For each category, we provide a characterization based on the exclusive or simultaneous presence of positive and negative cycles in the associated sign graph. Most realistic examples of biochemical networks fall in the gray area of systems in which both positive and negative cycles are present: Therefore, both oscillatory and bistable behaviors are in principle possible. However, many canonical example circuits exhibiting oscillations or bistability fall in the categories of strong candidate oscillators/multistationary systems, in agreement with our results.","Franco Blanchini1, Elisa Franco2 & Giulia Giordano",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-014-0023-y,"Feedback loops,Cycles,Multistationarity,Stability,Oscillator,Structural properties"

An example illustrates how the actional model can be applied to find the influence level of users in a real social network on the assumption of available initial data.",D. A. Gubanov1 & A. G.

2882,Orbital stability and instability of periodic wave solutions for the \(\phi ^4\)-model,"In this work we find explicit periodic wave solutions for the classical \(\phi ^4\)-model, and study their corresponding orbital stability/instability in the energy space. In particular, for this model we find at least four different branches of spatially-periodic wave solutions, which can be written in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. Two of these branches correspond to superluminal waves (speeds larger than the speed of light), the third-one corresponds to sub-luminal waves and the remaining one corresponds to stationary complex-valued waves. In this work we prove the orbital instability of real-valued sub-luminal traveling waves. Furthermore, we prove that under some additional hypothesis, complex-valued stationary waves as well as the  real-valued zero-speed sub-luminal wave are all stable. This latter case is related (in some sense) to the classical Kink solution of the \(\phi ^4\)-model.","José Manuel Palacios

After proper scaling, the paths fill out a region in the tx-plane. The region may come to the hard edge at 0 or may not, depending on the value of the product ab. We formulate a vector equilibrium problem for this model, which is defined for three measures, with upper constraints on the first and third measures and an external field on the second measure. It is shown that the limiting mean distribution of the paths at time t is given by the second component of the vector that minimizes this vector equilibrium problem. The proof is based on a steepest descent analysis for a 4 × 4 matrix-valued Riemann-Hilbert problem which characterizes the correlation kernel of the paths at time t. We also discuss the precise locations of the phase transitions.","Steven Delvaux1, Arno B. J.

2886,Modeling and Analysis of a Density-Dependent Stochastic Integral Projection Model for a Disturbance Specialist Plant and Its Seed Bank,"In many plant species dormant seeds can persist in the soil for one to several years. The formation of these seed banks is especially important for disturbance specialist plants, as seeds of these species germinate only in disturbed soil. Seed movement caused by disturbances affects the survival and germination probability of seeds in the seed bank, which subsequently affect population dynamics. In this paper, we develop a stochastic integral projection model for a general disturbance specialist plant-seed bank population that takes into account both the frequency and intensity of random disturbances, as well as vertical seed movement and density-dependent seedling establishment. We show that the probability measures associated with the plant-seed bank population converge weakly to a unique measure, independent of initial population. We also show that the population either persists with probability one or goes extinct with probability one, and provides a sharp criteria for this dichotomy. We apply our results to an example motivated by wild sunflower (Helianthus annuus) populations, and explore how the presence or absence of a “storage effect” impacts how a population responds to different disturbance scenarios.","Eric Alan Eager1, Richard Rebarber2 & Brigitte Tenhumberg",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-014-9978-y,"Disturbance specialist,Seed bank,Integral Projection Model,Weak convergence,Density dependence,Storage effect"

The System Analysis of Evolving Economy (SAEE) approach to modelling economic processes developed in 1975 is described. Based on SAEE Intertemporal Equilibrium Model with Control of Capital (IEMCC) and three-product nonlinear deaggregation of Russian national accounts by consumption are described. The model agents of two types are introduced: mass (rational) and individual (scenario) agents. The former type includes Bank, Producer, Household, Owner, and Trader. The latter type includes State, Central Bank, Exporter, and Importer. The model is reduced to a boundary-value problem for a significantly nonlinear system of equations. These equations are derived from the initial hypothesis by means of the original economic modelling assistance system ECOMOD which is developed in the computer algebra system MAPLE. The model is adjusted with respect to official statistical quarterly data from 2004 till 2010. The calculation results are provided. The model proves the ability to model the Russian economy as a result of interactions of rational and individual macroeconomic agents.","M. Yu. Andreyev1, V. P. Vrzheshch2, N. P. Pilnik3, I. G.

To establish sufficient conditions for termination and nontermination simultaneously, the authors propose the notion of strong/weak non-termination which under/over-approximates non-termination. Based on polynomial ideal theory, the authors show that the set of all strong non-terminating inputs (SNTI) and weak non-terminating inputs (WNTI) both correspond to the real varieties of certain polynomial ideals. Furthermore, the authors prove that the variety of SNTI is computable, and under some sufficient conditions the variety of WNTI is also computable. Then by checking the computed SNTI and WNTI varieties in parallel, termination properties of a considered MPP can be asserted. As a consequence, the authors establish a new framework for termination analysis of MPPs.","Jiang Liu1, Ming Xu2, Naijun Zhan3 & …Hengjun Zhao1,",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-014-2145-6,"Polynomial ideals,polynomial programs,termination analysis"

But the real nature of the random decrement signature has been misunderstood until now. Moreover, the various interpretations were made in continuous time setting, while real experimental data are obtained in discrete time. In this paper, the really implemental discrete time algorithms are studied. The asymptotic analysis as the number of triggering points go to infinity is achieved, and a Law of Large Numbers as well as a Central Limit Theorem is proved. Moreover, the limit as the discretization time step goes to zero is computed, giving more tractable formulas to approximate the random decrement. This is a new approach of the famous “Kac-Slepian paradox” [Ann. Math. Stat., 30, 1215–1228 (1959)]. The main point might be that the RDT is a very efficient functional estimator of the correlation function of a stationary ergodic Gaussian process.

In the computations of the nonlinear loads on offshore structures, the most challenging task is the computation of the free surface integral. The main contribution to this integrand is due to the non-homogeneous term present in the free surface condition for the second-order diffracted potential. The combined first-order diffracted potential is obtained using Graf’s addition theorem for the Bessel functions. Since the free surface term for the second-order diffracted potential can be expressed in terms of the first-order potentials, the free surface term can be computed using the knowledge of only the first order potentials. Numerical results are presented for different parameters. It is found that the main contribution to the nonlinear free surface term comes from the first few individual terms, the contribution from all other individual terms is insignificant. The results obtained in this analysis indicate that the contribution to the individual free surface term \(f_{l}\left( r/a\right) \) is negligible for higher values of M. It is observed that the succesive difference decreases rapidly as M increases. The zeroth-order term mainly contributes to the total free surface term. Except the first few individual terms, the contribution from all other individual terms to the free surface term is negligible.",Dambaru Bhatta,International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40819-021-01022-5,"Free surface elevation,Nonlinear,Incompressible,Wave diffraction,Velocity potential"

Magnetic buckling of a welded rod is found to be described by a surprisingly degenerate bifurcation, which is unfolded when both transverse anisotropy of the rod and angular velocity are considered.

We also analyze in detail, for a general monotonically increasing mortality function, the “epidemiological” case in which plasmids confer a net cost on their hosts, and demonstrate that it is possible for such plasmids to become established.

2905,Distribution of Eigenvalues of Highly Palindromic Toeplitz Matrices,"Consider the ensemble of real symmetric Toeplitz matrices whose entries are i.i.d. random variables chosen from a fixed probability distribution p of mean 0, variance 1, and finite higher moments. Previous work (Bryc et al., Ann. Probab. 34(1):1–38, 2006; Hammond and Miller, J. Theor. Probab. 18(3):537–566, 2005) showed that the spectral measures (the density of normalized eigenvalues) converge almost surely to a universal distribution almost that of the Gaussian, independent of p. The deficit from the Gaussian distribution is due to obstructions to solutions of Diophantine equations and can be removed (see Massey et al., J. Theor. Probab. 20(3):637–662, 2007) by making the first row palindromic. In this paper we study the case where there is more than one palindrome in the first row of real symmetric Toeplitz matrices. Using the method of moments and an analysis of the resulting Diophantine equations, we show that the spectral measures converge almost surely to a universal distribution. Assuming a conjecture on the resulting Diophantine sums (which is supported by numerics and some theoretical arguments), we prove that the limiting distribution has a fatter tail than any previously seen limiting spectral measure.","Steven Jackson1, Steven J.

2906,FEVS: A Functional Equivalence Verification Suite for High-Performance Scientific Computing,"Scientific computing poses many challenges to formal verification, including the facts that typical programs: (1) are numerically-intensive, (2) are highly-optimized (often by hand), and (3) often employ parallelism in complex ways. Another challenge is specifying correctness. One approach is to provide a very simple, sequential version of an algorithm together with the optimized (possibly parallel) version. The goal is to show the two versions are functionally equivalent, or provide useful feedback when they are not. We present a new verification suite consisting of pairs of programs of this form. The suite can be used to evaluate and compare tools that verify functional equivalence. The programs are all in C and the parallel versions use the Message Passing Interface. They are simpler than codes used in practice, but are representative of real coding patterns (e.g., manager-worker parallelism, loop tiling) and present realistic challenges to current verification tools.

2907,A multilocus analysis of intraspecific competition and stabilizing selection on a quantitative trait,"The equilibrium structure of an additive, diallelic multilocus model of a quantitative trait under frequency- and density-dependent selection is derived. The trait is under stabilizing selection and mediates intraspecific competition as induced, for instance, by differential resource utilization. It is assumed that stabilizing selection is weak, but the strength of competition may be arbitrary relative to it. Density dependence is caused by population regulation, which may be of a very general kind. The number and effects of loci are arbitrary, and stabilizing selection is not necessarily symmetric with respect to the range of phenotypic values. All previously studied models of intraspecific competition for a continuum of resources known to the author reduce to a special case of the present model if overall selection is weak. Therefore, in this case our results are applicable as approximations to all these models. Our central result is the (nearly) complete characterization of the equilibrium and stability structure in terms of all parameters. It is derived under the sole assumption that selection is weak enough relative to recombination to ignore linkage disequilibrium. In particular, necessary and sufficient conditions on the strength of competition relative to stabilizing selection are found that ensure the maintenance of multilocus polymorphism and the occurrence of disruptive selection. In this case, explicit formulas for the number of polymorphic loci at equilibrium, the allele frequencies, the genetic variance, and the strength of disruptive selection are obtained. For two loci, the effects of linkage are investigated analytically; for several loci, they are studied numerically.","Reinhard Bürger1,",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-004-0294-2,"Density-dependent selection,frequency-dependent selection,disruptive selection,balancing selection,recombination,linkage equilibrium,genetic variation,difference equations,gradient system"
2908,"The Summation Formulae of Euler–Maclaurin, Abel–Plana, Poisson, and their Interconnections with the Approximate Sampling Formula of Signal Analysis","This paper is concerned with the two summation formulae of Euler–Maclaurin (EMSF) and Abel–Plana (APSF) of numerical analysis, that of Poisson (PSF) of Fourier analysis, and the approximate sampling formula (ASF) of signal analysis. It is shown that these four fundamental propositions are all equivalent, in the sense that each is a corollary of any of the others. For this purpose ten of the twelve possible implications are established. Four of these, namely the implications of the grouping \({\text{APSF}\Leftarrow\text{ASF}\Rightarrow\text{EMSF}\Leftrightarrow\text{PSF}}\) are shown here for the first time. The proofs of the others, which are already known and were established by three of the above authors, have been adapted to the present setting. In this unified exposition the use of powerful methods of proof has been avoided as far as possible, in order that the implications may stand in a clear light and not be overwhelmed by external factors. Finally, the four propositions of this paper are brought into connection with four propositions of mathematical analysis for bandlimited functions, including the Whittaker–Kotel’nikov–Shannon sampling theorem. In conclusion, all eight propositions are equivalent to another. Finally, the first three summation formulae are interpreted as quadrature formulae.","P. L. Butzer1, P. J. S. G. Ferreira2, G.

Although it is an extension of numerical linear algebra, it has many essential differences from numerical linear algebra and more difficulties than it. In this paper, we present a survey on the state of the art knowledge on this topic, which is incomplete, and indicate some new trends for further research.

2911,Characteristic analysis of mechanical thermal coupling model for bearing rotor system of high-speed train,"Based on Newton’s second law and the thermal network method, a mechanical thermal coupling model of the bearing rotor system of high-speed trains is established to study the interaction between the bearing vibration and temperature. The influence of lubrication on the vibration and temperature characteristics of the system is considered in the model, and the real-time relationship between them is built up by using the transient temperature field model. After considering the lubrication, the bearing outer ring vibration acceleration and node temperature considering grease are lower, which shows the necessity of adding the lubrication model. The corresponding experiments for characteristics of vibration and temperature of the model are respectively conducted. In the envelope spectrum obtained from the simulation signal and the experimental signal, the frequency values corresponding to the peaks are close to the theoretical calculation results, and the error is very small. In the three stages of the temperature characteristic experiment, the node temperature change of the simulation model is consistent with the experiment. The good agreement between simulation and experiments proves the effectiveness of the model. By studying the influence of the bearing angular and fault size on the system node temperature, as well as the change law of bearing lubrication characteristics and temperature, it is found that the worse the working condition is, the higher the temperature is. When the ambient temperature is low, the viscosity of grease increases, and the oil film becomes thicker, which increases the sliding probability of the rolling element, thus affecting the normal operation of the bearing, which explains the phenomenon of frequent bearing faults of high-speed trains in the low-temperature area of Northeast China. Further analysis shows that faults often occur in the early stage of train operation in the low-temperature environment.","Yongqiang Liu1,2,3, Baosen Wang2,3, Shaopu Yang3, Yingying Liao4 & …Tao Guo",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-022-2893-5,"high-speed train,coupling dynamic model,thermal network method,track irregularity (TI),low temperature"
2912,Pulse Dynamics in a Three-Component System: Existence Analysis,"In this article, we analyze the three-component reaction-diffusion system originally developed by Schenk et al. (PRL 78:3781–3784, 1997). The system consists of bistable activator-inhibitor equations with an additional inhibitor that diffuses more rapidly than the standard inhibitor (or recovery variable). It has been used by several authors as a prototype three-component system that generates rich pulse dynamics and interactions, and this richness is the main motivation for the analysis we present. We demonstrate the existence of stationary one-pulse and two-pulse solutions, and travelling one-pulse solutions, on the real line, and we determine the parameter regimes in which they exist. Also, for one-pulse solutions, we analyze various bifurcations, including the saddle-node bifurcation in which they are created, as well as the bifurcation from a stationary to a travelling pulse, which we show can be either subcritical or supercritical. For two-pulse solutions, we show that the third component is essential, since the reduced bistable two-component system does not support them. We also analyze the saddle-node bifurcation in which two-pulse solutions are created. The analytical method used to construct all of these pulse solutions is geometric singular perturbation theory, which allows us to show that these solutions lie in the transverse intersections of invariant manifolds in the phase space of the associated six-dimensional travelling wave system. Finally, as we illustrate with numerical simulations, these solutions form the backbone of the rich pulse dynamics this system exhibits, including pulse replication, pulse annihilation, breathing pulses, and pulse scattering, among others.","Arjen Doelman1,2, Peter van Heijster1 & Tasso J.

2916,Undergraduate Quantitative Biology Impact on Biology Preservice Teachers,"Quantitative biology is a rapidly advancing field in the biological sciences, particularly given the rise of large datasets and computer processing capabilities that have continually expanded over the past 50 years. Thus, the question arises, How should K-12 biology teachers incorporate quantitative biology skills into their biology curriculum? The teaching of quantitative biology has not been readily integrated into undergraduate biology curricula that impact preservice teachers. This has potential to cascade effects downward into the quality of learning about quantitative biology that can be expected in K-12 contexts. In this paper, we present the perspectives of a mathematics educator, a science educator, and two biologists, and discuss how we have personally incorporated aspects of quantitative reasoning into our courses. We identify some common challenges relevant to expanding implementation of quantitative reasoning in undergraduate biology courses in order to serve the needs of preservice teachers—both in their disciplinary courses and methods courses. For example, time constraints, math pedagogical content knowledge, and personal views about the relevance of quantitative principles in biology teaching and learning can impact how and to what extent they become implemented in curricula. In addition, although national standards at the K-12 level do address quantitative reasoning, the emphasis and guidance provided are sparser than for other content standards. We predict that both K-12 standards and guidelines for undergraduate education will only increase in their emphasis on quantitative skills as computation, “big data,” and statistical modeling are increasingly becoming requisite skills for biologists.","Robert Mayes

2917,Laplacian Instability of Planar Streamer Ionization Fronts—An Example of Pulled Front Analysis,"Streamer ionization fronts are pulled fronts that propagate into a linearly unstable state; the spatial decay of the initial condition of a planar front selects dynamically one specific long-time attractor out of a continuous family. A stability analysis for perturbations in the transverse direction has to take these features into account. In this paper we show how to apply the Evans function in a weighted space for this stability analysis. Zeros of the Evans function indicate the intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds; they are used to determine the eigenvalues. Within this Evans function framework, we define a numerical dynamical systems method for the calculation of the dispersion relation as an eigenvalue problem. We also derive dispersion curves for different values of the electron diffusion constant and of the electric field ahead of the front. Numerical solutions of the initial value problem confirm the eigenvalue calculations. The numerical work is complemented with an analysis of the Evans function leading to analytical expressions for the dispersion relation in the limit of small and large wave numbers. The paper concludes with a fit formula for intermediate wave numbers. This empirical fit supports the conjecture that the smallest unstable wave length of the Laplacian instability is proportional to the diffusion length that characterizes the leading edge of the pulled ionization front.","Gianne Derks1, Ute Ebert2,3 & Bernard Meulenbroek2,",Journal of Nonlinear Science,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00332-008-9023-0,"Pulled front,Stability analysis,Streamer ionization front,Dispersion relation,Wave selection of Laplacian instability"
2918,An extension ofA-stability to alternating direction implicit methods,"Completely implicit, noniterative, finite-difference schemes have recently been developed by several authors for nonlinear, multidimensional systems of hyperbolic and mixed hyperbolic-parabolic partial differential equations. The method of Douglas and Gunn or the method of approximate factorization can be used to reduce the computational problem to a sequence of one-dimensional or alternating direction implicit (ADI) steps. Since the eigenvalues of partial differential equations (for example, the equations of compressible fluid dynamics) are often widely distributed with large imaginary parts,A-stable integration formulas provide ideal time-differencing approximations. In this paper it is shown that if anA-stable linear multistep method is used to integrate a model two-dimensional hyperbolic-parabolic partial differential equation, then one can always construct an ADI scheme by the method of approximate factorization which is alsoA-stable, i.e., unconditionally stable. A more restrictive result is given for three spatial dimensions. Since necessary and sufficient conditions forA-stability can easily be determined by using the theory of positive real functions, the stability analysis of the factored partial difference equations is reduced to a simple algebraic test.",R.

The microlocal asymptotic analysis is a new spectral study of singularities. It can inherit from the algebraic structure of ℬ some good properties with respect to nonlinear operations.","Jean-André Marti1,",Acta Applicandae Mathematicae,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10440-008-9275-6,"Sheaf theory,Algebras of generalized functions,Localization,Microlocalization and wave front sets,Nonlinear partial differential equations"
2922,Asymptotic Analysis and Analytical Solutions of a Model of Cardiac Excitation,"
We describe an asymptotic approach to gated ionic models of single-cell cardiac excitability. It has a form essentially different from the Tikhonov fast-slow form assumed in standard asymptotic reductions of excitable systems. This is of interest since the standard approaches have been previously found inadequate to describe phenomena such as the dissipation of cardiac wave fronts and the shape of action potential at repolarization. The proposed asymptotic description overcomes these deficiencies by allowing, among other non-Tikhonov features, that a dynamical variable may change its character from fast to slow within a single solution. The general asymptotic approach is best demonstrated on an example which should be both simple and generic. The classical model of Purkinje fibers (Noble in J. Physiol. 160:317–352, 1962) has the simplest functional form of all cardiac models but according to the current understanding it assigns a physiologically incorrect role to the Na current. This leads us to suggest an “Archetypal Model” with the simplicity of the Noble model but with a structure more typical to contemporary cardiac models. We demonstrate that the Archetypal Model admits a complete asymptotic solution in quadratures. To validate our asymptotic approach, we proceed to consider an exactly solvable “caricature” of the Archetypal Model and demonstrate that the asymptotic of its exact solution coincides with the solutions obtained by substituting the “caricature” right-hand sides into the asymptotic solution of the generic Archetypal Model. This is necessary, because, unlike in standard asymptotic descriptions, no general results exist which can guarantee the proximity of the non-Tikhonov asymptotic solutions to the solutions of the corresponding detailed ionic model.

A thorough review of the existing cryptocurrency literatures helps us to understand the status-quo and the promising research future of this emerging field. This paper provides a systematic review of the cryptocurrency literatures by employing bibliometrics and network analysis methods. A total of 833 publications from Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus have been collected in the time period of January 2008 to June 2018. We examine the descriptive features, countries’ contributions and collaboration networks, author collaboration networks and reference co-citation networks to identify actors with significant influence in this field. The results show that cryptocurrency research is experiencing exponential growth, but scientific collaborations between different countries and authors are still insufficient. The intellectual bases of the cryptocurrency domain rest on the early-year literatures that provide fundamental understandings for cryptocurrency, and that bridge different research fields.

We show that these nonsingular Gaussian actions exhibit a phase transition phenomenon and we relate it to new quantitative invariants for affine isometric actions. We use the Patterson-Sullivan theory as well as Lyons-Pemantle work on tree-indexed random walks in order to give a precise description of this phase transition for affine isometric actions of groups acting on trees.

We proceed to a systematic exploration of this phenomenon. The meaning of the word “most” is made rigorous by isoperimetrictype inequalities that bound the measure of the exceptional sets. The meaning of the work “close” is defined in three main ways, each of them giving rise to related, but different inequalities. The inequalities are all proved through a common scheme of proof.

2936,On the uniqueness theorem of Holmgren,"We review the classical Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem and the related uniqueness theorem of Holmgren, in the simple setting of powers of the Laplacian and a smooth curve segment in the plane. As a local problem, the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya and Holmgren theorems supply a complete answer to the existence and uniqueness issues. Here, we consider a global uniqueness problem of Holmgren’s type. Perhaps surprisingly, we obtain a connection with the theory of quadrature identities, which demonstrates that rather subtle algebraic properties of the curve come into play. For instance, if \(\Omega \) is the interior domain of an ellipse, and I is a proper arc of the ellipse \(\partial \Omega \), then there exists a nontrivial biharmonic function u in \(\Omega \) which is three-flat on I (i.e., all partial derivatives of u of order \(\le 2\) vanish on I) if and only if the ellipse is a circle. Another instance of the same phenomenon is that if \(\Omega \) is bounded and simply connected with \(C^\infty \)-smooth Jordan curve boundary, and if the arc \(I\subset \partial \Omega \) is nowhere real-analytic, then we have local uniqueness already with sub-Cauchy data: if a function is biharmonic in \({\mathcal {O}}\cap \Omega \) for some planar neighborhood \({\mathcal {O}}\) of I, and is three-flat on I, then it vanishes identically on \({\mathcal {O}}\cap \Omega \), provided that \({\mathcal {O}}\cap \Omega \) is connected. Finally, we consider a three-dimensional setting, and analyze it partially using analogues of the square of the standard \(2\times 2\) Cauchy–Riemann operator. In a special case when the domain is of periodized cylindrical type, we find a connection with the massive Laplacian [the Helmholz operator with imaginary wave number] and the theory of generalized analytic (or pseudoanalytic) functions of Bers and Vekua.",Haakan Hedenmalm,Mathematische Zeitschrift,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00209-015-1488-6,"Cauchy problem,Dirichlet problem,Holmgren’s uniqueness theorem"
2937,Designing metabolism: Alternative connectivities for the pentose phosphate pathway,"We present a method for generating alternative biochemical pathways between specified compounds. We systematically generated diverse alternatives to the nonoxidative stage of the pentose phosphate pathway, by first finding pathways between 5-carbon and 6-carbon skeletons. Each solution of the equations for the stoichiometric coefficients of skeleton-changing reactions defines a set of networks. Within each set we selected networks with modules; a module is a coupled set of reactions that occurs more than one in a network. The networks can be classified into at least 53 families in at least seven superfamilies, according to the number, the input-output relations, and the internal structure of their modules. We then assigned classes of enzymes to mediate transformations of carbon skeletons and modifications of functional groups. The ensemble of candidate networks was too large to allow complete determination of the optimal network. However, among the networks we studied the real pathway is especially favorable in several respects. It has few steps, uses no reducing or oxidizing compounds, requires only one ATP in one direction of flux, and does not depend on recurrent inputs.","Jay E.

2938,"Factoring Solovay-random extensions, with application to the reduction property","If a real a is random over a model M and \(x\in M[a]\) is another real then either (1) \(x\in M\), or (2) \(M[x]=M[a]\), or (3) M[x] is a random extension of M and M[a] is a random extension of M[x]. This result may belong to the old set theoretic folklore. It appeared as Exapmle 1.17 in Jech’s book “Multiple forcing” without the claim that M[x] is a random extension of M in (3), but, likely, it has never been published with a detailed proof. A corollary: \({{\varvec{\Sigma }}}^{1}_{n}\)-Reduction holds for all \(n\ge 3\), in models extending the constructible universe \(\mathbf{L}\) by \(\kappa \)-many random reals, \(\kappa \) being any uncountable cardinal in \(\mathbf{L}\).

We prove that the local topological linearization implies the local smooth linearization, at generic points. At arbitrary points, it implies the local conjugation to a linear system via a homeomorphism that induces a smooth diffeomorphism on the state variables, and, except at “strongly” singular points, this homeomorphism can be chosen to be a smooth mapping (the inverse map needs not be smooth).

2941,Optimization of express line performance: numerical examination and management considerations,"Improving the waiting process at checkouts in stores is an important goal of operations management in the era of time-based competition. The paper presents a method for evaluating the effect of express lines on the waiting process. An optimization model is developed which minimizes the average waiting time in line with respect to the maximum number of items allowed in the express lines. The research is based on a real case of a do-it-yourself superstore, but the methodology applied at the store can be used generally.The optimization model includes sensitivity analyses. Sensitivity analyses show how the optimal value of the limit parameter changes if major parameters of the model change. The results of these analyses help managers make decisions about short and medium-term operations of express lines.The major conclusion of the paper is that the optimal operation of express lines does not improve the average waiting time significantly, but the effect of non-optimal operation can be very unfavorable. Therefore, a successful implementation of express lines requires a thorough analysis of operational issues and a careful consideration of perceptional issues as well.","Tamás Koltai1, Noémi Kalló1 & László Lakatos",Optimization and Engineering,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-008-9053-3,"Queuing systems,Express lines,Sensitivity analysis"

The closure of a semiordering is also considered, and it is shown that the space \(\mathcal{Y}_M\) consisting of all semiorderings lying over M plays an important role in understanding the closure of M. The result of Schmüdgen for preorderings in [29] is strengthened and extended to quadratic modules. The extended result is used to construct an example of a non-archimedean quadratic module describing a compact semialgebraic set that has the strong moment property.

In this paper we only briefly address the mathematical aspects of MRMs. Instead, emphasis is put on specification techniques. In an application independent way, we distinguish seven classes of specification techniques: stochastic Petri nets, queuing networks, fault trees, production rule systems, communicating processes, specialized languages, and hybrid techniques. For these seven classes, we discuss the main principles, give examples and discuss software tools that support the use of these techniques. An overview like this has not been presented in the literature before.

2947,Advanced Genetic Programming Based Machine Learning,"A Genetic Programming based approach for solving classification problems is presented in this paper. Classification is understood as the act of placing an object into a set of categories, based on the object’s properties; classification algorithms are designed to learn a function which maps a vector of object features into one of several classes. This is done by analyzing a set of input-output examples (“training samples”) of the function. Here we present a method based on the theory of Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming that interprets classification problems as optimization problems: Each presented instance of the classification problem is interpreted as an instance of an optimization problem, and a solution is found by a heuristic optimization algorithm. The major new aspects presented in this paper are advanced algorithmic concepts as well as suitable genetic operators for this problem class (mainly the creation of new hypotheses by merging already existing ones and their detailed evaluation). The experimental part of the paper documents the results produced using new hybrid variants of Genetic Algorithms as well as investigated parameter settings. Graphical analysis is done using a novel multiclass classifier analysis concept based on the theory of Receiver Operating Characteristic curves.","Stephan Winkler1, Michael Affenzeller1 & Stefan Wagner",Journal of Mathematical Modelling and Algorithms,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10852-007-9065-6,"Evolutionary algorithms,Genetic programming,Data mining"

2953,Link weights recovery in heterogeneous information networks,"Socio-technical systems usually consist of many intertwined networks, each connecting different types of objects or actors through a variety of means. As these networks are co-dependent, one can take advantage of this entangled structure to study interaction patterns in a particular network from the information provided by other related networks. A method is, hence, proposed and tested to recover the weights of missing or unobserved links in heterogeneous information networks (HIN)—abstract representations of systems composed of multiple types of entities and their relations. Given a pair of nodes in a HIN, this work aims at recovering the exact weight of the incident link to these two nodes, knowing some other links present in the HIN. To do so, probability distributions resulting from path-constrained random walks, i.e., random walks where the walker is forced to follow only a specific sequence of node types and edge types, capable to capture specific semantics and commonly called a meta-path, are combined in a linearly fashion to approximate the desired result. This method is general enough to compute the link weight between any types of nodes. Experiments on Twitter and bibliographic data show the applicability of the method.","Hong-Lan Botterman

The main target of this work is to analyze the stability behavior and develop a numerical simulation of the fractional SEIRS model. The reproduction number \({R}_{0}\) and the order of the fractional derivative \(\beta \) play an important role in controlling the stability of the equilibrium points of the model, where it was shown that the disease-free equilibrium point \({P}_{0}\) is asymptotically stable if \({R}_{0}<1\) and unstable for \({R}_{0}>1\). The proper choice of the system parameters alongside the order of differentiation guarantee that the epidemic equilibrium point \({P}_{1}\) is asymptotically stable. The presence of a time delay in treatment and its effect on the stability behavior of the model is considered. Also, bifurcation analysis of the model depending on the time delay, \( \beta \) and the treatment rate is discussed.

2963,Minskyan classical growth cycles: stability analysis of a stock-flow consistent macrodynamic model,"This paper follows van der Ploeg (Metroeconomica 37(2):221–230, 1985)’s research program in testing both its extension of Goodwin (in: Feinstein (ed) Socialism, capitalism and economic growth, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 4, 54–58, 1967) predator–prey model and the Minsky Financial Instability Hypothesis (FIH) proposed by Keen (J Post Keynes Econ 17(4):607–635, 1995). By endowing the production sector with CES technology rather than Leontief, van der Ploeg showed that the possible substitution between capital and labor transforms the close orbit into a stable focus. Furthermore, Keen (1995)’s model relaxed the assumption that profit is equal to investment by introducing a nonlinear investment function. His aim was to incorporate Minsky’s insights concerning the role of debt finance. The primary goal of this paper is to incorporate additional properties, inspired by van der Ploeg’s framework, into Keen’s model. Additionally, we outline possibilities for production technology that could be considered within this research program. Using numerical techniques, we show that our new model keeps the desirable properties of Keen’s model. However, we also demonstrate that when the economy is endowed with a class of CES production function that includes the Cobb–Douglas and the linear technology as limit cases, the unique stable equilibrium is an economically desirable one. Finally, we propose a modified extension that includes speculative component in the economy as in Grasselli and Costa-Lima (Math Financ Econ 6(3):191–210, 2012) and investigate its effect on the dynamics. We conclude that CES production function is a more suitable assumption for empirical purposes than the Leontief counterpart. Finally, we show, using numerical simulations, that under plausible calibration, the model endowed with CES production function eventually lose the cyclical property of Goodwin’s model with and without the speculative component.","Daniel Bastidas1, Adrien Fabre2 & Florent Mc Isaac",Mathematics and Financial Economics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11579-018-0231-6,"Prey–predator,Goodwin model,Keen model,Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis,Dynamical systems,Speculation"

The contemporary state-of-the-art of the theory of permanents, questions on the existence and the enumeration of matrices with nonnegative elements, and a number of problems connected with latin rectangles (enumeration, problem of completing a latin square, equidistant arrays) are examined. The main directions in combinatorial theory in connection with selection problems also are analyzed: matroid theory, transversals, extremal problems (coverings, depth of a matrix, Sperner families).

2965,An Analysis of the Superiorization Method via the Principle of Concentration of Measure,"The superiorization methodology is intended to work with input data of constrained minimization problems, i.e., a target function and a constraints set. However, it is based on an antipodal way of thinking to the thinking that leads constrained minimization methods. Instead of adapting unconstrained minimization algorithms to handling constraints, it adapts feasibility-seeking algorithms to reduce (not necessarily minimize) target function values. This is done while retaining the feasibility-seeking nature of the algorithm and without paying a high computational price. A guarantee that the local target function reduction steps properly accumulate to a global target function value reduction is still missing in spite of an ever-growing body of publications that supply evidence of the success of the superiorization method in various problems. We propose an analysis based on the principle of concentration of measure that attempts to alleviate this guarantee question of the superiorization method.",Yair Censor1 & Eliahu Levy,Applied Mathematics & Optimization,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00245-019-09628-4,"Superiorization,Perturbation resilience,Feasibility-seeking algorithm,Target function reduction,Concentration of measure,Superiorization matrix,Linear superiorization,Hilbert-Schmidt norm,Random matrix"
2966,Mathematical analysis of a delayed epidemic model with nonlinear incidence and treatment rates,"In the case of an outbreak of an epidemic, psychological or inhibitory effects and various limitations on treatment methods play a major role in controlling the impact of the epidemic on society. The Monod–Haldane functional-type incidence rate is taken to interpret the psychological or inhibitory effect on the population with time delay representing the incubation period of the disease. The Holling type III saturated treatment rate is considered to incorporate the limitation in treatment availability to infective individuals. This novel combination of the Monod–Haldane incidence rate and Holling type III treatment rate is applied herein to a time-delayed susceptible–infected–recovered epidemic model to incorporate these important aspects. The mathematical analysis shows that the model has two equilibrium points, namely disease-free and endemic. Detailed dynamical analysis of the model is performed using the basic reproduction number \(R_{0}\), center manifold theory, and Routh–Hurwitz criterion. The results show that that the disease can be eradicated when the basic reproduction number is less than unity, while the disease will persist when the basic reproduction number is greater than unity. The Hopf bifurcation at endemic equilibrium is addressed. Furthermore, the global stability behavior of the equilibria is discussed. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to support the analytical findings.",Abhishek Kumar1 &  Nilam,Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-019-09989-3,"Holling type III treatment rate, local and global stability,Hopf bifurcation,Monod–Haldane incidence rate,SIR model,Time delay"

The existence and uniqueness of the solution are obtained applying the Faedo-Galerkin method with some compactness results and energy method. In addition, we prove the uniform stability of the energy. For numerical simulation, firstly we use the Crank–Nicolson Galerkin method, in which it consists of applying the finite element method in the spatial variable and the Crank–Nicolson method over time. Subsequently, in the resulting nonlinear algebraic system, for each discrete time, we apply the Newton’s method without losing the convergence order. Moreover, are presented figures of the numerical solutions for the two-dimensional case, tables with error and convergence order and the numerical energy decay. These results justify the consistency between the theoretical and numerical results.","Adriano A. Alcântara

Their analysis is useful in several biomedical applications, like monitoring dose or drug treatment responses of patients over time in pharmacogenomics studies. Many statistical and data analysis tools have been used to extract useful information. In particular, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), with its natural nonnegativity constraints, has demonstrated its ability to extract from 2D microarrays relevant information on specific genes involved in the particular biological process. In this paper, we propose a new NMF model, namely Orthogonal Joint Sparse NMF, to extract relevant information from 3D microarrays containing the time evolution of a 2D microarray, by adding additional constraints to enforce important biological proprieties useful for further biological analysis. We develop multiplicative updates rules that decrease the objective function monotonically, and compare our approach to state-of-the-art NMF algorithms on both synthetic and real data sets.","Flavia Esposito

The dynamics of the water depth and of the water velocity are described by the Shallow-Water equations, taking into account the bottom and friction slopes. Since some physical parameters are unknown, a stabilizing boundary control is first computed for their nominal values, and then a sensitivity analysis is performed to measure the impact of the uncertainty in the parameters on a given to-be-controlled output. The unknown physical parameters are described by some probability distribution functions. Numerical simulations are performed to measure the first-order and total sensitivity indices.","Alexandre Janon1, Maëlle Nodet2, Christophe Prieur3 & …Clémentine Prieur","Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems",2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00498-015-0151-4,"Sensitivity analysis,Shallow-Water equation,Saint Venant equation,Control,Sobol indices,Metamodel"

This partition function admits a matrix model-like representation, whose spectral curve can be characterized in terms of a certain scalar, linear, non-local Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP). We develop tools necessary to address a class of such RHPs involving finite subgroups of \(\mathrm{PSL}_{2}({\mathbb {C}})\). We associate with such problems a (maybe infinite) root system and describe the relevance of the orbits of the Weyl group in the construction of its solutions. These techniques are applied to the RHP relevant for Chern–Simons theory on Seifert spaces. When \(\pi _1(M)\) is finite—i.e., for manifolds M that are quotients of \({\mathbb {S}}_{3}\) by a finite isometry group of type ADE—we find that the Weyl group associated with the RHP is finite and the spectral curve is algebraic and can be in principle computed. We then show that the large N expansion of \(Z_N(M)\) is computed by the topological recursion. This has consequences for the analyticity properties of \({\mathrm {SU}}/{\mathrm {SO}}/{\mathrm {Sp}}\) perturbative invariants of knots along fibers in M.","Gaëtan Borot1,2,3, Bertrand Eynard4,5 & Alexander Weisse",Selecta Mathematica,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00029-016-0266-6,"14Hxx,45Exx,51Pxx,57M27,60B20,81T45"

2975,"From Harmonic Maps to the Nonlinear Supersymmetric Sigma Model of Quantum Field Theory: at the Interface of Theoretical Physics, Riemannian Geometry, and Nonlinear Analysis","Harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces arise from a conformally invariant variational problem. Therefore, on one hand, they are intimately connected with moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, and on the other hand, because the conformal group is noncompact, constitute a prototype for the formation of singularities, the so-called bubbles, in geometric analysis. In theoretical physics, they arise from the nonlinear \(\sigma \)-model of quantum field theory. That model possesses a supersymmetric extension, coupling a harmonic map like field with a nonlinear spinor field. In the physical model, that spinor field is anticommuting. In this contribution, we analyze both a mathematical version with a commuting spinor field and the original supersymmetric version. Moreover, this model gives rise to a further field, a gravitino, that can be seen as the supersymmetric partner of a Riemann surface metric. Altogether, this leads to a beautiful combination of concepts from quantum field theory, structures from Riemannian geometry and Riemann surface theory, and methods of nonlinear geometric analysis.","Jürgen Jost1, Enno Keßler1, Jürgen Tolksdorf1,2, Ruijun Wu1 & …Miaomiao Zhu",Vietnam Journal of Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10013-018-0298-7,"Harmonic maps,Dirac-harmonic maps,Non-linear sigma model,Supersymmetry,Gravitino"

We also extend this result, so as to preserve specified roots of the frequency response, and derive an approximation result for refinable functions whose integer translates are orthonormal.

A discrete time delay is utilized to represent gestation delay of the predator population. Positivity of solutions and uniform persistence of system are discussed. In the absence of time delay, by taking economic interest as a bifurcation parameter, some sufficient conditions associated with additive Allee effect and economic interest are derived to show that the proposed system undergoes singularity-induced bifurcation around the interior equilibrium. In the presence of time delay, combined dynamic effects of time delay and additive Allee effect on population dynamics are discussed in the case of positive economic interest of commercial harvesting. Existence of Hopf bifurcation and local stability switch around the interior equilibrium are studied as gestation delay crosses the critical value. Furthermore, properties of Hopf bifurcation are investigated based on the center manifold theorem and the norm form of a delayed singular system. Existence of global continuation of periodic solutions bifurcating from interior equilibrium is discussed by using a global Hopf bifurcation theorem.

2989,The Fshape Framework for the Variability Analysis of Functional Shapes,"This article introduces a full mathematical and numerical framework for treating functional shapes (or fshapes) following the landmarks of shape spaces and shape analysis. Functional shapes can be described as signal functions supported on varying geometrical supports. Analyzing variability of fshapes’ ensembles requires the modeling and quantification of joint variations in geometry and signal, which have been treated separately in previous approaches. Instead, building on the ideas of shape spaces for purely geometrical objects, we propose the extended concept of fshape bundles and define Riemannian metrics for fshape metamorphoses to model geometric-functional transformations within these bundles. We also generalize previous works on data attachment terms based on the notion of varifolds and demonstrate the utility of these distances. Based on these, we propose variational formulations of the atlas estimation problem on populations of fshapes and prove existence of solutions for the different models.

2990,Stability analysis for uncertain neutral-type stochastic nonlinear systems with mixed time-varying delays,"This study investigates the robust stability problem in the presence of uncertain parameters for a class of stochastic neutral-type systems with mixed time-varying delays, where external disturbance and nonlinearity are considered together. The nonlinear function is assumed to satisfy the one-sided Lipschitz condition and the quadratic inner-boundedness condition. By constructing a modified Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and using the free-weighting matrix technique, some new delay-dependent criteria for the stability of the problem are presented. In particular, the derivatives of the time-varying delays are no longer limited to being less than one. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the derived results.","Tengyu Ma1,2 & Longsuo Li",Journal of Inequalities and Applications,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13660-019-2105-8,"Uncertainty,Neutral-type stochastic systems,Mixed time-varying delays,Linear matrix inequality"
2991,Fourier analysis of the local discontinuous Galerkin method for the linearized KdV equation,"A Fourier/stability analysis of the third-order Korteweg–de Vries equation is presented subject to a class of local discontinuous Galerkin discretization using high-degree Lagrange polynomials. The selection of stability parameters involved in the method is made on the basis of the study of the higher frequency eigenmodes and the Fourier analysis. Explicit analytical dispersion relation and group velocity are obtained and the stability study of the discrete frequency is performed. The emergence of gaps in the imaginary part of the computed frequency is observed and studied for the first time to our knowledge. Further, a superconvergent result is demonstrated for the discrete frequency by obtaining an explicit analytical asymptotic formula for the latter.

3001,Shifted extended global Lanczos processes for trace estimation with application to network analysis,"The need to estimate upper and lower bounds for matrix functions of the form \({\mathrm{trace}}(W^Tf(A)V)\), where the matrix \(A\in {{\mathbb {R}}}^{n\times n}\) is large and sparse, \(V,W\in {{\mathbb {R}}}^{n\times s}\) are block vectors with \(1\le s\ll n\) columns, and f is a function arises in many applications, including network analysis and machine learning. This paper describes the shifted extended global symmetric and nonsymmetric Lanczos processes and how they can be applied to approximate the trace. These processes compute approximations in the union of Krylov subspaces determined by positive powers of A and negative powers of \(A-\sigma I_n\), where the shift \(\sigma\) is a user-chosen parameter. When A is nonsymmetric, transposes of these powers also are used. When A is symmetric and \(W=V\), we describe how error bounds or estimates of bounds for the trace can be computed by pairs of Gauss and Gauss-Radau quadrature rules, or by pairs of Gauss and anti-Gauss quadrature rules. These Gauss-type quadrature rules are defined by recursion coefficients for the shifted extended global Lanczos processes. Gauss and anti-Gauss quadrature rules also can be applied to give estimates of error bounds for the trace when A is nonsymmetric and \(W\ne V\). Applications to the computation of the Estrada index for networks and to the nuclear norm of a large matrix are presented. Computed examples show the shifted extended symmetric and nonsymmetric Lanczos processes to produce accurate approximations in fewer steps than the standard symmetric and nonsymmetric global Lanczos processes, respectively.","A.

At the core of this framework is nonlinear dynamic generative modeling of time series using the Koopman operator which is an infinite-dimensional but linear operator. Rather than working with the underlying nonlinear model, we propose two simpler linear representations or model forms based on Koopman spectral properties. We show that these model forms are invariants of the generative model and can be readily identified directly from data using techniques for computing Koopman spectral properties without requiring the explicit knowledge of the generative model. We also introduce different notions of distances on the space of such model forms which is essential for model comparison/clustering. We employ the space of Koopman model forms equipped with distance in conjunction with classical machine learning techniques to develop a framework for automatic feature generation for time series classification. The forecasting/anomaly detection framework is based on using Koopman model forms along with classical linear systems and control approaches. We demonstrate the proposed framework for human activity classification, and for time series forecasting/anomaly detection in power grid application.",Amit Surana,Journal of Nonlinear Science,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00332-017-9441-y,"Koopman operator,Dynamical Systems and Control,Machine learning,Nonlinear time series modeling and analysis"

To illustrate the general approach, we then turn our attention to a class of multivariate marked Hawkes processes with generalized exponential kernels, comprising among others the so-called Erlang kernels. We provide explicit conditions on the kernel functions and the mark dynamics under which a certain transformation of the original process is Markovian and V-geometrically ergodic.

3007,Analysis of Markovian Competitive Situations Using Nonatomic Games,"We study discrete-time dynamic games with effectively identical players who possess private states that evolve randomly. Players in these games are concerned with their undiscounted sums of period-wise payoffs in the finite-horizon case and discounted sums of stationary period-wise payoffs in the infinite-horizon case. In the general semi-anonymous setting, the other players influence a particular player’s payoffs and state evolutions through the joint state–action distributions that they form. When dealing with large finite games, we find it profitable to exploit symmetric mixed equilibria of a reduced feedback type for the corresponding nonatomic games (NGs). These equilibria, when continuous in a certain probabilistic sense, can be used to achieve near-equilibrium performances when there are a large but finite number of players. We focus on the case where independently generated shocks drive random actions and state transitions. The NG equilibria we consider are random state-to-action maps that pay no attention to players’ external environments. Yet, they can be adopted for a variety of real situations where the knowledge about the other players can be incomplete. Results concerning finite horizons also form the basis of a link between an NG’s stationary equilibrium and good stationary profiles for large finite games.",Jian Yang,Dynamic Games and Applications,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13235-020-00356-x,"Nonatomic game,Markov equilibrium,Large finite game"

3009,On the modeling and analysis of the biological regulatory network of NF-\({\kappa }\)B activation in HIV-1 infection,"PurposeThe complex interactions between genetic machinery of HIV-1 and host immune cells mediate dynamic adaptive responses leading to Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome. These interactions are captured as Biological Regulatory Network (BRN) which acts to maintain the viability of host cell machinery through feedback control mechanism which is a characteristic of complex adaptive systems. In this study, the BRN of immune response against HIV-1 infection is modeled to investigate the role of NF-κB and TNF-α in disease transmission using qualitative (discrete) and hybrid modeling formalisms.MethodsQualitative and Hybrid modeling approaches are used to model the BRN for the dynamic analysis. The qualitative model is based on the logical parameters while the hybrid model is based on the time delay parameters.ResultsThe qualitative model gives useful insights about the physiological condition observed as the homeostasis of all the entities of the BRN as well as pathophysiological behaviors representing high expression levels of NF-κB, TNF-α and HIV. Since the qualitative model is time abstracted, so a hybrid model is developed to analyze the behavior of the BRN by associating activation and inhibition time delays with each entity. HyTech tool synthesizes time delay constraints for the existence of homeostasis.
ConclusionHybrid model reveals various viability constraints that characterize the conditional existence of cyclic states (homeostasis). The resultant relations suggest larger cycle period of HIV-1 than the cycle periods of the other two entities (NF-κB and TNF-α) to maintain a homeostatic expressions of these entities.

3012,Analysis of multiple scattering iterations for high-frequency scattering problems. I: the two-dimensional case,"We present an analysis of a recently proposed integral-equation method for the solution of high-frequency electromagnetic and acoustic scattering problems that delivers error-controllable solutions in frequency-independent computational times. Within single scattering configurations the method is based on the use of an appropriate ansatz for the unknown surface densities and on suitable extensions of the method of stationary phase. The extension to multiple-scattering configurations, in turn, is attained through consideration of an iterative (Neumann) series that successively accounts for further geometrical wave reflections. As we show, for a collection of two-dimensional (cylindrical) convex obstacles, this series can be rearranged into a sum of periodic orbits (of increasing period), each corresponding to contributions arising from waves that reflect off a fixed subset of scatterers when these are transversed sequentially in a periodic manner. Here, we analyze the properties of these periodic orbits in the high-frequency regime, by deriving precise asymptotic expansions for the “currents” (i.e. the normal derivative of the fields) that they induce on the surface of the obstacles. As we demonstrate these expansions can be used to provide accurate estimates of the rate at which their magnitude decreases with increasing number of reflections, which defines the overall rate of convergence of the multiple-scattering series. Moreover, we show that the detailed asymptotic knowledge of these currents can be used to accelerate this convergence and, thus, to reduce the number of iterations necessary to attain a prescribed accuracy.",Fatih Ecevit1 & Fernando Reitich,Numerische Mathematik,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-009-0249-z,"Periodic Orbit,Asymptotic Expansion,Geometrical Optic,Prescribe Accuracy,Integral Equation Formulation"

This model is a simplified version of the model we proposed in Clapp et al. (Cancer Res 75:4053–4062, 2015). Our simplification is based on the observation that certain key characteristics of the dynamics of CML can be captured with a three-compartment model: two for the leukemic cells (stem cells and mature cells) and one for the immune response. We characterize the existence of steady states and their stability for generic forms of immunosuppressive effects of leukemic cells. We provide a complete co-dimension one bifurcation analysis. Our results show how clinical response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment is compatible with the existence of a stable low disease, treatment-free steady state.","Apollos Besse1,2, Geoffrey D.

3016,Tensor principal component analysis via convex optimization,"This paper is concerned with the computation of the principal components for a general tensor, known as the tensor principal component analysis (PCA) problem. We show that the general tensor PCA problem is reducible to its special case where the tensor in question is super-symmetric with an even degree. In that case, the tensor can be embedded into a symmetric matrix. We prove that if the tensor is rank-one, then the embedded matrix must be rank-one too, and vice versa. The tensor PCA problem can thus be solved by means of matrix optimization under a rank-one constraint, for which we propose two solution methods: (1) imposing a nuclear norm penalty in the objective to enforce a low-rank solution; (2) relaxing the rank-one constraint by semidefinite programming. Interestingly, our experiments show that both methods can yield a rank-one solution for almost all the randomly generated instances, in which case solving the original tensor PCA problem to optimality.

3017,Asymptotic analysis of some classes of ordinary differential equations with large high-frequency terms,"A complete asymptotic expansion is constructed for solutions of the Cauchy problem for nth order linear ordinary differential equations with rapidly oscillating coefficients, some of which may be proportional to ωn/2, where ω is oscillation frequency. A similar problem is solved for a class of systems of n linear first-order ordinary differential equations with coefficients of the same type. Attention is also given to some classes of first-order nonlinear equations with rapidly oscillating terms proportional to powers ωd. For such equations with d ∈ (1/2, 1], conditions are found that allow for the construction (and strict justification) of the leading asymptotic term and, in some cases, a complete asymptotic expansion of the solution of the Cauchy problem.",V.

We prove that the variant of the Beurling–Ahlfors extension defined by using the heat kernel yields a holomorphic map for u on a domain of the p-Besov space to the space of p-integrable Beltrami coefficients. This in particular gives a global real-analytic section for the Teichmüller projection from the space of p-integrable Beltrami coefficients to the p-Weil–Petersson Teichmüller space.

3019,The Relative Contribution of Direct and Environmental Transmission Routes in Stochastic Avian Flu Epidemic Recurrence: An Approximate Analysis,"We present an analysis of an avian flu model that yields insight into the roles of different transmission routes in the recurrence of avian influenza epidemics. Recent modelling work suggests that the outbreak periodicity of the disease is mainly determined by the environmental transmission rate. This conclusion, however, is based on a modelling study that only considers a weak between-host transmission rate. We develop an approximate model for stochastic avian flu epidemics, which allows us to determine the relative contribution of environmental and direct transmission routes to the periodicity and intensity of outbreaks over the full range of plausible parameter values for transmission. Our approximate model reveals that epidemic recurrence is chiefly governed by the product of a rotation and a slowly varying standard Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process (i.e. mean-reverting process). The intrinsic frequency of the damped deterministic version of the system predicts the dominant period of outbreaks. We show that the typical periodicity of major avian flu outbreaks can be explained in terms of either or both types of transmission and that the typical amplitude of epidemics is highly sensitive to the direct transmission rate.","May Anne Mata

3021,Stability Analysis of a Bulk–Surface Reaction Model for Membrane Protein Clustering,"Protein aggregation on the plasma membrane (PM) is of critical importance to many cellular processes such as cell adhesion, endocytosis, fibrillar conformation, and vesicle transport. Lateral diffusion of protein aggregates or clusters on the surface of the PM plays an important role in governing their heterogeneous surface distribution. However, the stability behavior of the surface distribution of protein aggregates remains poorly understood. Therefore, understanding the spatial patterns that can emerge on the PM solely through protein–protein interaction, lateral diffusion, and feedback is an important step toward a complete description of the mechanisms behind protein clustering on the cell surface. In this work, we investigate the pattern formation of a reaction–diffusion model that describes the dynamics of a system of ligand–receptor complexes. The purely diffusive ligand in the cytosol can bind receptors in the PM and the resultant ligand–receptor complexes not only diffuse laterally but can also form clusters resulting in different oligomers. Finally, the largest oligomers recruit ligands from the cytosol using positive feedback. From a methodological viewpoint, we provide theoretical estimates for diffusion-driven instabilities of the protein aggregates based on the Turing mechanism. Our main result is a threshold phenomenon, in which a sufficiently high recruitment of ligands promotes the input of new monomeric components and consequently drives the formation of a single-patch spatially heterogeneous steady state.","Lucas M.

3022,Eigensolutions and spectral analysis of a model for vertical gene transfer of plasmids,"Plasmids are autonomously replicating genetic elements in bacteria. At cell division, plasmids are distributed among the two daughter cells. This gene transfer from one generation to the next is called vertical gene transfer. We study the dynamics of a bacterial population carrying plasmids and are in particular interested in the long-time distribution of plasmids. Starting with a model for a bacterial population structured by the discrete number of plasmids, we proceed to the continuum limit in order to derive a continuous model. The model incorporates plasmid reproduction, division and death of bacteria, and distribution of plasmids at cell division. It is a hyperbolic integro-differential equation and a so-called growth-fragmentation-death model. As we are interested in the long-time distribution of plasmids we study the associated eigenproblem and show existence of eigensolutions. The stability of this solution is studied by analyzing the spectrum of the integro-differential operator given by the eigenproblem. By relating the spectrum with the spectrum of an integral operator we find a simple real dominating eigenvalue with a non-negative corresponding eigenfunction. Moreover, we describe an iterative method for the numerical construction of the eigenfunction.","Eva Stadler

3023,Describing limits of integrable functions as grid functions of nonstandard analysis,"In functional analysis, there are different notions of limit for a bounded sequence of \(L^1\) functions. Besides the pointwise limit, that does not always exist, the behaviour of a bounded sequence of \(L^1\) functions can be described in terms of its weak-\(\star \) limit or by introducing a measure-valued notion of limit in the sense of Young measures. Working in Robinson’s nonstandard analysis, we show that for every bounded sequence \(\{z_n\}_{n \in \mathbb {N}}\) of \(L^1\) functions there exists a function of a hyperfinite domain (i.e. a grid function) that represents both the weak-\(\star \) and the Young measure limits of the sequence. This result has relevant applications to the study of nonlinear PDEs. We discuss the example of an ill-posed forward–backward parabolic equation.","Emanuele Bottazzi

The division rate of the proliferating cells is assumed to be nonlinear due to the limitation of the nutrient and space. The model includes a proportion of newborn cells that enter directly the quiescent phase with age zero. This proportion can reflect the effect of treatment by drugs such as erlotinib. The bidirectional transition between proliferating cells and quiescent cells is considered. The local and global stabilities of the trivial steady state are investigated. The existence and local stability of the positive steady state are also analyzed. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the results and to examine the impacts of parameters on the nonlinear dynamics of the model.,"Zijian Liu

3026,Convergence Analysis of the Parareal-Euler Algorithm for Systems of ODEs with Complex Eigenvalues,"Parareal is an iterative algorithm and is characterized by two propagators \(\mathscr {G}\) and \(\mathscr {F}\), which are respectively associated with large step size \(\varDelta T\) and small step size \(\varDelta t\), where \(\varDelta T=J\varDelta t\) and \(J\ge 2\) is an integer. The choice \(\mathscr {G}=\mathscr {F}=\)Backward-Euler denotes the simplest implicit parareal solver, which we call Parareal-Euler, and has been studied widely in recent years. For linear problem \(\mathbf {U}'(t)+\mathbf {A}\mathbf {U}(t)=\mathbf {g}(t)\) with \(\mathbf {A}\) being a symmetric positive definite matrix, this algorithm converges very fast and the convergence rate is insensitive to the change of J and \(\varDelta t\). However, for the case that the spectrum of \(\mathbf {A}\) contains complex values, no provable results are available in the literature so far. Previous studies based on numerical plotting show that we can not expect convergence for the Parareal-Euler algorithm on the whole right-hand side of the complex plane. Here, we consider a representative situation: \(\sigma (\mathbf {A})\subseteq \mathbf {D}(\theta ):=\left\{ (x,iy)\in \mathbf {C}: x\ge 0, |y|\le \tan (\theta )x\right\} \) with \(\theta \in (0, \frac{\pi }{2})\), i.e., the spectrum \(\sigma (A)\) is contained in a sectorial region. Spectrum distribution of this type arises naturally for semi-discretizing a wide rang of time-dependent PDEs, e.g., the Fokker-Planck equations. We derive condition, which is independent of J and depends on \(\theta \) only, to ensure convergence of the Parareal-Euler algorithm.

It is shown that the regular spacetime point operators form a Banach manifold endowed with a canonical Fréchet-smooth Riemannian metric. The so-called expedient differential calculus is introduced with the purpose of treating derivatives of functions on Banach spaces which are differentiable only in certain directions. A chain rule is proven for Hölder continuous functions which are differentiable on expedient subspaces. These results are made applicable to causal fermion systems by proving that the causal Lagrangian is Hölder continuous. Moreover, Hölder continuity is analyzed for the integrated causal Lagrangian.

3030,Sensitivity analysis for expected utility maximization in incomplete Brownian market models,"We examine the issue of sensitivity with respect to model parameters for the problem of utility maximization from final wealth in an incomplete Samuelson model and mainly, but not exclusively, for utility functions of positive-power type. The method consists in moving the parameters through change of measure, which we call a weak perturbation, decoupling the usual wealth equation from the varying parameters. By rewriting the maximization problem in terms of a convex-analytical support function of a weakly-compact set, crucially leveraging on the work (Backhoff and Fontbona in SIAM J Financ Math 7(1):70–103, 2016), the previous formulation let us prove the Hadamard directional differentiability of the value function with respect to the market price of risk, the drift and interest rate parameters, as well as for volatility matrices under a stability condition on their Kernel, and derive explicit expressions for the directional derivatives. We contrast our proposed weak perturbations against what we call strong perturbations, where the wealth equation is directly influenced by the changing parameters. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that both points of view generally yield different sensitivities unless e.g. if initial parameters and their perturbations are deterministic.","Julio Backhoff Veraguas

We first present the blow-up criteria and the precise blow-up quantity in terms of the Moser-type estimate in Sobolev spaces.

3040,Spatiotemporal Pattern Extraction by Spectral Analysis of Vector-Valued Observables,"We present a data-driven framework for extracting complex spatiotemporal patterns generated by ergodic dynamical systems. Our approach, called vector-valued spectral analysis (VSA), is based on an eigendecomposition of a kernel integral operator acting on a Hilbert space of vector-valued observables of the system, taking values in a space of functions (scalar fields) on a spatial domain. This operator is constructed by combining aspects of the theory of operator-valued kernels for multitask machine learning with delay-coordinate maps of dynamical systems. In contrast to conventional eigendecomposition techniques, which decompose the input data into pairs of temporal and spatial modes with a separable, tensor product structure, the patterns recovered by VSA can be manifestly non-separable, requiring only a modest number of modes to represent signals with intermittency in both space and time. Moreover, the kernel construction naturally quotients out dynamical symmetries in the data and exhibits an asymptotic commutativity property with the Koopman evolution operator of the system, enabling decomposition of multiscale signals into dynamically intrinsic patterns. Application of VSA to the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky model demonstrates significant performance gains in efficient and meaningful decomposition over eigendecomposition techniques utilizing scalar-valued kernels.","Dimitrios Giannakis

3043,Nonsmooth Analysis of Singular Values. Part II: Applications,"
In this work we continue the nonsmooth analysis of absolutely symmetric functions of the singular values of a real rectangular matrix. Absolutely symmetric functions are invariant under permutations and sign changes of its arguments. We extend previous work on subgradients to analogous formulae for the proximal subdifferential and Clarke subdifferential when the function is either locally Lipschitz or just lower semicontinuous. We illustrate the results by calculating the various subdifferentials of individual singular values. Another application gives a nonsmooth proof of Lidskii’s theorem for weak majorization.

3044,Spectral Graph Matching and Regularized Quadratic Relaxations I Algorithm and Gaussian Analysis,"Graph matching aims at finding the vertex correspondence between two unlabeled graphs that maximizes the total edge weight correlation. This amounts to solving a computationally intractable quadratic assignment problem. In this paper, we propose a new spectral method, graph matching by pairwise eigen-alignments (GRAMPA). Departing from prior spectral approaches that only compare top eigenvectors, or eigenvectors of the same order, GRAMPA first constructs a similarity matrix as a weighted sum of outer products between all pairs of eigenvectors of the two graphs, with weights given by a Cauchy kernel applied to the separation of the corresponding eigenvalues, then outputs a matching by a simple rounding procedure. The similarity matrix can also be interpreted as the solution to a regularized quadratic programming relaxation of the quadratic assignment problem. For the Gaussian Wigner model in which two complete graphs on n vertices have Gaussian edge weights with correlation coefficient \(1-\sigma ^2\), we show that GRAMPA exactly recovers the correct vertex correspondence with high probability when \(\sigma = O(\frac{1}{\log n})\). This matches the state of the art of polynomial-time algorithms and significantly improves over existing spectral methods which require \(\sigma \) to be polynomially small in n. The superiority of GRAMPA is also demonstrated on a variety of synthetic and real datasets, in terms of both statistical accuracy and computational efficiency. Universality results, including similar guarantees for dense and sparse Erdős–Rényi graphs, are deferred to a companion paper.","Zhou Fan1, Cheng Mao2, Yihong Wu1 & …Jiaming Xu",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-022-09570-y,"Graph matching,Quadratic assignment problem,Spectral methods,Convex relaxations,Quadratic programming,Random matrix theory"

3049,The distribution of radial eigenvalues of the Euclidean Laplacian on homogeneous isotropic trees,"Let \(\Omega\) be a bounded open subset of \({\mathbb {R}}^n\) and \(\Delta\) the Euclidean Laplace operator \(\sum _{i=1}^n \partial ^2/\partial x_i^2\). Let \(\beta (x)\) denote the number of eigenvalues less or equal to x with respect to the eigenvalue problem \(\Delta f = -x f\) on \(\Omega\) with \(f=0\) on the boundary of \(\Omega\). A well-known result due to Hermann Weyl gives the asymptotic formula \(\beta (x)= (2 \pi )^{-n} B_n m_n(\Omega ) x^{n/2}+ o(x^{n/2})\) as \(x\rightarrow \infty\), where \(B_n\) is the volume of the unit ball in \({\mathbb {R}}^n\) and \(m_n(\Omega )\) is the volume of \(\Omega\). In this work, we consider the analogous problem for radial functions in the discrete setting of the homogeneous isotropic tree T of homogeneity \(q+1\) (\(q\ge 2\)). As the volume of T with respect to the hyperbolic metric is infinite, we don’t expect and indeed we show that there is no analogous result for the commonly used hyperbolic Laplacian on T. We consider instead the eigenvalue problem for radial functions on T with respect to the Euclidean Laplacian on T introduced in [6], where the boundary condition \(f=0\) means that f converges radially to 0 at \(\infty\). We prove that \(\beta (x)\) is within 2 of \(\log _q \sqrt{x}\). We also consider other boundary conditions and pose some open questions.","Joel M.

It turns out that the spectral convergence rate can only occur for KGE models with entire potentials. In the latter case, an explicit quantitative error estimate, characterizing spectral convergence rate, is provided. The paper is concluded with several computational examples supporting our theoretical analysis.","Sergey Shindin1, Nabendra Parumasur1 & Gafari Lukumon",Afrika Matematika,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13370-022-01021-9,"Fourier-type pseudo-spectral methods,Error analysis,Spectral convergence,Klein-Gordon equation"

We provide a positive answer to this question. More precisely, taking advantage of recent advances on the front of stability for persistence diagrams, we introduce a novel algebraic construction, based on a pair of nested families of simplicial complexes built on top of the point cloud L, from which the persistence diagram of f can be faithfully approximated. We derive from this construction a series of algorithms for the analysis of scalar fields from point cloud data. These algorithms are simple and easy to implement, they have reasonable complexities, and they come with theoretical guarantees. To illustrate the genericity and practicality of the approach, we also present some experimental results obtained in various applications, ranging from clustering to sensor networks.","Frédéric Chazal1, Leonidas J.

The existence and uniqueness of solutions in the case of unbounded (infinite) delay are first proved by using the classical technique of Galerkin approximations. The local stability analysis of constant solutions (equilibria) is also carried out by exploiting two approaches. Namely, the Lyapunov function method and by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functionals. The asymptotic stability and hence, the uniqueness of equilibrium solution are obtained by constructing Lyapunov functionals. Moreover, some sufficient conditions ensuring the polynomial stability of the equilibrium solution in a particular case of unbounded variable delay will be provided. Exponential stability for other special cases of infinite delay remains as an open problem.","Linfang Liu1,2 & Tomás Caraballo",Journal of Dynamics and Differential Equations,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10884-018-9703-x,"Stochastic Navier–Stokes equation,Equilibrium solution,Polynomial stability,Unbounded variable delay"
3054,Stability and Hopf bifurcation analysis for a three-species food chain model with fear and two different delays,"In this paper, we consider a Hastings–Powell type model, which consists of a three-species food chain model with fear effect. For more realistic formulation, we incorporated two time delays into the model, one for prey density another for the gestation of the middle and top predator populations. By choosing time delays as the bifurcation parameters, the essential mathematical features and their dynamics are studied in terms of local stability and Hopf bifurcation analysis. Linearizing the system at the positive equilibrium point and analyzing the distribution of the roots of the associated characteristic equation, the conditions for the existence of Hopf bifurcation are obtained. It is shown that for the gradual increase of the magnitude of delay, the stability of equilibrium point changes and the system exhibits a Hopf bifurcation as the time delay passes through some critical values. Furthermore, an explicit formula for determining the direction of the Hopf bifurcation and the stability of the bifurcating periodic orbits are investigated by using the normal form method and center manifold theory. Finally, several numerical simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the derived theoretical results and to examine the analytical findings.","Abdul Hussain Surosh1,2, Javad Alidousti

3057,On theoretical and empirical algorithmic analysis of the efficiency gap measure in partisan gerrymandering,"Partisan gerrymandering is a major cause for voter disenfranchisement in United States. However, convincing US courts to adopt specific measures to quantify gerrymandering has been of limited success to date. Recently, Stephanopoulos and McGhee in several papers introduced a new measure of partisan gerrymandering via the so-called “efficiency gap” that computes the absolute difference of wasted votes between two political parties in a two-party system; from a legal point of view the measure was found legally convincing in a US appeals court in a case that claims that the legislative map of the state of Wisconsin was gerrymandered. The goal of this article is to formalize and provide theoretical and empirical algorithmic analyses of the computational problem of minimizing this measure. To this effect, we show the following: (a) On the theoretical side, we formalize the corresponding minimization problem and provide non-trivial mathematical and computational complexity properties of the problem of minimizing the efficiency gap measure. Specifically, we prove the following results for the formalized minimization problem: (i) We show that the efficiency gap measure attains only a finite discrete set of rational values. (observations of similar nature but using different arguments were also made independently by Cho and Wendy (Univ Pa Law Rev 166(1), Article 2, 2017). (ii) We show that, assuming P \(\ne \textsf {NP}\), for general maps and arbitrary numeric electoral data the minimization problem does not admit any polynomial time algorithm with finite approximation ratio. Moreover, we show that the problem still remains \(\textsf {NP}\)-complete even if the numeric electoral data is linear in the number of districts, provided the map is provided in the form of a planar graph (or, equivalently, a polygonal subdivision of the two-dimensional Euclidean plane). (iii) Notwithstanding the previous hardness results, we show that efficient exact or efficient approximation algorithms can be designed if one assumes some reasonable restrictions on the map and electoral data. Items (ii) and (iii) mentioned above are the first non-trivial computational complexity and algorithmic analyses of this measure of gerrymandering. (b) On the empirical side, we provide a simple and fast algorithm that can “un-gerrymander” the district maps for the states of Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania (based on the efficiency gap measure) by bring their efficiency gaps to acceptable levels from the current unacceptable levels. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first publicly available implementation and its corresponding evaluation on real data for any algorithm for the efficiency gap measure. Our work thus shows that, notwithstanding the general worst-case approximation hardness of the efficiency gap measure as shown by us, finding district maps with acceptable levels of efficiency gaps could be a computationally tractable problem from a practical point of view. Based on these empirical results, we also provide some interesting insights into three practical issues related the efficiency gap measure.","Tanima Chatterjee1, Bhaskar DasGupta

Moreover, the mystery has not been solved yet; an imagined utility function on the risk-return plane has been applied to establish the mean-variance model, but this hypothetical utility function not only lacks foundation, it also holds an internal contradiction. This paper studies these basic problems. Through risk preference VNM condition is proposed to solve the expected utility enigma. How can a utility function satisfy the VNM condition? This is a basic problem that is hard to deal with. Fortunately, it is found in this paper that the VNM utility function can have some concrete forms when individuals have constant relative risk aversion. Furthermore, in order to explore the basis of mean-variance utility, an MV function is founded that is based on the VNM utility function and rooted in underlying investment activities. It is shown that the MV function is just the investor’s utility function on the risk-return plane and that it has normal properties. Finally, the MV function is used to analyze the laws of investment activities in a systematic risk environment. In doing so, a tool, TRR, is used to measure risk aversion tendencies and to weigh risk and return.",Kangping Wu,Acta Mathematica Scientia,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10473-022-0611-0,"VNM condition,relative risk aversion tendency,mean-variance utility,systematic risk"

They enable comparison of the sensities to changes of different elements in the projection matrix; in other words, comparison of partial derivatives of the eigenvectors. These kinds of sensitivities can be used in applied problems such as an analysis of the effect of harvesting on the population structure. However, in this paper, we examine the application of the sensitivities in a more general ecological context. We investigate why the stable stage structure of the mustard aphid,Lipaphis erysimi, changes very little in the temperature interval 10–30°C. The sensitivities of the stable stage structure at 15°C and 25°C were derived. The character of the sensitivites were the same in both temperatures although the stage structure was more sensitive to changes at 15°C than at 25°C. The sensitivity analysis also revealed that the temperature variation results in changes in fecundity and developmental rate that have a counteractive effect on the population structure.","Uno Wennergren1 nAff2, Per Weinerfelt2 & Göran Forsling",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,1994,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02458275,"Population Growth Rate,Reproductive Stage,Projection Matrix,Developmental Rate,Vital Rate"

3065,"Structural, continuity, and asymptotic properties of a branching particle system","We delineate a connection between the stochastic evolution of the cluster structure of a specific branching–diffusing particle system and a certain previously unknown structure-invariance property of a related class of distributions. Thus, we demonstrate that a Pólya–Aeppli sum of i.i.d.r.v.’s with a common zero-modified geometric distribution also follows a Pólya–Aeppli law. The consideration of these classes is motivated by and applied to studying subtle properties of this branching–diffusing particle system, which belongs to the domain of attraction of a continuous Dawson–Watanabe superprocess. We illustrate this structure-invariance property by considering the Athreya–Ney-type representation of the cluster structure of our particle system. Also, we apply this representation to prove the continuity in mean square of a related real-valued stochastic process. In contrast to other works in this field, we impose the condition that the initial random number of particles follows a Pólya–Aeppli law – a condition that is consistent with stochastic models that emerge in such varied fields as population genetics, ecology, insurance risk, and bacteriophage growth. Our results extend some recent work of Vinogradov. Specifically, we resolve the issue of noninvariance of the initial field and manage to avoid related anomalies that arose in earlier studies. Also, we demonstrate that under natural additional assumptions, our particle system must have evolved from a scaled Poisson field starting at a specified time. In some sense, this result provides a partial justification for assuming that the system had originated at a certain time in the past from a Poisson field of particles. We demonstrate that the corresponding high-density limit of our branching–diffusing particle system inherits an analogous backward-evolution property. Several of our results illustrate a general convergence theorem of Jørgensen et al. to members of the power-variance family of distributions. Finally, combining a Poisson mixture representation for the branching particle system considered with certain sharp analytical methods gives us an explicit representation for the leading error term of the high-density approximation as a linear combination of related Bessel functions.

3067,Interactions between mechanics and differential geometry in the 19th century,"79. This study of the interaction between mechanics and differential geometry does not pretend to be exhaustive. In particular, there is probably more to be said about the mathematical side of the history from Darboux to Ricci and Levi Civita and beyond. Statistical mechanics may also be of interest and there is definitely more to be said about Hertz (I plan to continue in this direction) and about Poincaré's geometric and topological reasonings for example about the three body problem [Poincaré 1890] (cf. also [Poincaré 1993], [Andersson 1994] and [Barrow-Green 1994]). Moreover, it would be interesting to find out how the 19th century ideas discussed here influenced the developments in the 20th century. Einstein himself is a hotly debated case.Yet, despite these shortcommings, I hope that this paper has shown that the interactions between mechanics and differential geometry is not a 20th century invention. Klein's view (see my Introduction) that Riemannian geometry grew out of mechanics, more specifically the principle of least action, cannot be maintained. On the other hand, when Riemannian geometry became known around 1870 it was immediately used in mechanics by Lipschitz. He began a continued tradition in this field, which had several elements in common with the new view of mechanics conceived by the physicists and explicitly carried out by Hertz.Before 1870 we found only scattered interactions between differential geometry and mechanics and only direct ones for systems of two or three degrees of freedom. For more degrees of freedom the geometrical ideas were in some interesting cases taken over by analogy, but these analogies did not lead to formal introduction of geometries of more than three dimensions.",Jesper Lützen,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,1995,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00374699,"19th Century,Statistical Mechanic,Differential Geometry,Interesting Case,Century Idea"

3069,Bicomplex Hermitian Clifford analysis,"Complex Hermitian Clifford analysis emerged recently as a refinement of the theory of several complex variables, while at the same time, the theory of bicomplex numbers motivated by the bicomplex version of quantum mechanics is also under full development. This stimulates us to combine the Hermitian Clifford analysis with the theory of bicomplex number so as to set up the theory of bicomplex Hermitian Clifford analysis. In parallel with the Euclidean Clifford analysis, the bicomplex Hermitian Clifford analysis is centered around the bicomplex Hermitian Dirac operator : \(C^\infty (\mathbb{R}^{4n} ,\mathbb{W}_{4n} ) \to C^\infty (\mathbb{R}^{4n} ,\mathbb{W}_{4n} )\), where \(\mathbb{W}_{4n}\) is the tensor product of three algebras, i.e., the hyperbolic quaternion , the bicomplex number \(\mathbb{B}\), and the Clifford algebra ℝ0,4n
. The operator  is a square root of the Laplacian in ℝ4n, introduced by the formula  with K

j
 being the basis of , and \(\partial _{Z_j }\) denoting the twisted Hermitian Dirac operators in the bicomplex Clifford algebra \(\mathbb{B} \otimes \mathbb{R}_{0,4n}\) whose definition involves a delicate construction of the bicomplex Witt basis. The introduction of the operator  can also overturn the prevailing opinion in the Hermitian Clifford analysis in the complex or quaternionic setting that the complex or quaternionic Hermitiean monogenic functions are described by a system of equations instead of by a single equation like classical monogenic functions which are null solutions of Dirac operator. In contrast to the Hermitian Clifford analysis in quaternionic setting, the Poisson brackets of the twisted real Clifford vectors do not vanish in general in the bicomplex setting. For the operator , we establish the Cauchy integral formula, which generalizes the Martinelli-Bochner formula in the theory of several complex variables.","Lin Chen1, Guangbin Ren1 & Haiyan Wang",Frontiers of Mathematics in China,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11464-015-0410-1,"Bicomplex numbers,Hermitian Clifford analysis,Witt basis,Cauchy integral formula"

Here the surface to which the projectile is launched is represented by a convex impact function, while the projectile motion is described by a classical approximation model for flight curves that is widely considered acceptable for quadratic drag and launch angles up to moderate size. In this setting, the optimal range is given by the point where the impact function intersects the enveloping function induced by the family of flight paths. In the special case of a linear impact function, manageable explicit formulas for the range function, the maximal range, and the corresponding optimal launch angle are provided in terms of the Lambert W function. The article concludes with a solution to Tartaglia’s inverse problem in this context.","Robert Kantrowitz

The aim of this paper is to stress or reveal the true nature of these diverse conditions imposed on weights, appearing in a scattered and disconnected way in the literature: they turn out to fall into the framework of O-regular variation, and many of them are equivalent formulations of one and the same feature. Moreover, we study several indices of regularity/growth for both functions and sequences, which allow for the rephrasing of qualitative properties in terms of quantitative statements.","Javier Jiménez-Garrido

For each such system our results show that the Gaussian elimination without pivoting can proceed safely provided that the elements of the inverse of a certainM-matrix (associated with the coefficient matrixA) are not excessively large. We exhibit a particularly satisfactory situation for the special case whenA itself is an inverse of anM-matrix.

In the one-mode network, centrality analysis and spectrum analysis are used to describe the importance of each vertex. On this basis, two types of core vertices — The center of communities and the intermediary vertices among communities — are distinguished. The weighted extreme optimization (WEO) algorithm is also applied to detect communities in the one-mode network. In the “terrorist-terrorist organization” bipartite network, the authors adopt centrality analysis as well as clustering analysis based on the original bipartite network in order to calculate the importance of each vertex, and apply the edge clustering coefficient algorithm to detect the communities. The comparative and empirical analysis indicates that this research has been proved to be an effective way to identify the core members, key organizations, and communities in the network of “East Turkistan” terrorist activity. The results can provide a scientific basis for the analysis of “East Turkistan” terrorist activity, and thus provide decision support for the real work of “anti-terrorism”.","Julei Fu1, Ying Fan2, Yang Wang2,3 & …Shouyang Wang",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-014-3034-8,"Anti-terrorism,complex networks,terrorist activity network,vertex centrality"

Automorphisms with respect to these relations or operations are called symmetries. Many of them turn out to be real-linear up to a translation. We present a unified approach to the description of the general form of such symmetries based on adjacency preserving maps. We consider also symmetries defined on the set of all positive operators or on the set of all positive invertible operators. In particular, we will see that the structural result for adjacency preserving maps on the set of all positive invertible operators differs a lot from its counterpart on the set of all selfadjoint operators.",Peter Šemrl,Integral Equations and Operator Theory,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00020-011-1917-9,"Positive Real Number,Positive Operator,Selfadjoint Operator,Hermitian Matrice,Rank Operator"

If \(M\) is symmetric with respect to a point of \({\mathbb {R}}^n\), we call \(M\) centrally symmetric. We prove that every specular compact Nash set is Nash isomorphic to a specular real algebraic set and every specular noncompact Nash set is semialgebraically homeomorphic to a specular real algebraic set. The same is true replacing “specular” with “centrally symmetric”, provided the Nash set we consider is equal to the union of connected components of a real algebraic set. Less accurate results hold when such a union is symmetric with respect to a plane of positive dimension and it intersects that plane. The algebraic models for symmetric Nash sets \(M\) we construct are symmetric. If the local semialgebraic dimension of \(M\) is constant and positive, then we are able to prove that the set of birationally nonisomorphic symmetric algebraic models for \(M\) has the power of continuum.",Riccardo Ghiloni1 & Alessandro Tancredi,Revista Matemática Complutense,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13163-013-0140-4,"Algebraic models of Nash sets,Nash sets with symmetries"

3095,On Fundamental Solutions in Clifford Analysis,"Euclidean Clifford analysis is a higher dimensional function theory offering a refinement of classical harmonic analysis. The theory is centred around the concept of monogenic functions, which constitute the kernel of a first order vector valued, rotation invariant, differential operator \({\underline{\partial}}\) called the Dirac operator, which factorizes the Laplacian. More recently, Hermitean Clifford analysis has emerged as a new branch of Clifford analysis, offering yet a refinement of the Euclidean case; it focusses on a subclass of monogenic functions, i.e. the simultaneous null solutions, called Hermitean (or h−) monogenic functions, of two Hermitean Dirac operators \({\partial_{\underline{z}}}\) and \({\partial_{\underline{z}^\dagger}}\) which are invariant under the action of the unitary group, and constitute a splitting of the original Euclidean Dirac operator. In Euclidean Clifford analysis, the Clifford–Cauchy integral formula has proven to be a corner stone of the function theory, as is the case for the traditional Cauchy formula for holomorphic functions in the complex plane. Also a Hermitean Clifford–Cauchy integral formula has been established by means of a matrix approach. Naturally Cauchy integral formulae rely upon the existence of fundamental solutions of the Dirac operators under consideration. The aim of this paper is twofold. We want to reveal the underlying structure of these fundamental solutions and to show the particular results hidden behind a formula such as, e.g. \({\underline{\partial}E = \delta}\). Moreover we will refine these relations by constructing fundamental solutions for the differential operators issuing from the Euclidean and Hermitean Dirac operators by splitting the Clifford algebra product into its dot and wedge parts.","F.

The solution of the TPBVP is computationally expensive, particularly the simulation of the trajectory and the calculation of the Jacobian. A star connected network is used for implementation of parallel shooting algorithm. The Newton's method is used to generate successively approximate decision variables. The performance of thealgorithm with respect to the computation time for star connected network and the solution accuracy is done thorough the numerical simulation of the launch vehicle problem. A study on parallel computation time, speed-up and utilization is done. The algorithm gave a speed-up of 7 with 16 processors. A realistic data for a PSLV class of launch vehicle is used to simulate the closed-loop guided trajectory using the parallel shooting algorithm. A study on the effectiveness of the various nominal and off-nominal conditions on thrust and the sensor measurements are carried out to validate the closed-loop guidance. We have shown that the closed-loop guidance developed, in this paper achieves the desired height and the orbital velocity in presence of disturbances on thrust, and noise in measurements. The computation time details of the closed loop implementation on RS/6000 machine were carried out and presented.","Anand Jutty K1, M.

3104,"On subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic inflectional-wave/vortex interaction","An unstable inflection point developing in an oncoming two-dimensional boundary layer can give rise to nonlinear three-dimensional inflectional-wave/vortex interaction as described in recent papers by Hall and Smith [1], Brown et al. [2], and Smith et al. [3]. In the current study on the compressible range the flow is examined theoretically just downstream of the linear neutral position, in order to understand how the interaction may be initiated. The research addresses both moderately and strongly compressible regimes. In the latter regime the vorticity mode, the most dangerous one, is taken as the wave part, causing the hypersonic interaction to become concentrated in a thin temperature-adjustment layer lying at the outer edge of the boundary layer, just below the free stream. In both regimes, the result is a nonlinear integro-differential equation for the wave-pressure which implies four different types of downstream behaviour for the interaction-a far-downstream saturation, a finite-distance singularity, exponentially decaying waves (leaving pure vortex motion) or periodicity. In a principal finding of the study, the coefficients of the equation are worked out explicitly for hypersonic flow, and in particular for the case of unit Prandtl number and a Chapman fluid, where it is shown that for sufficiently high wall temperatures the wave angle of propagation must lie between 45° and 90° relative to the free-stream direction and also no periodic solutions may occur then. The theory applies also to wake flows and others. Connections with experimental findings are noted.",Dominic A. R. Davis1 & Frank T.

3105,On the equivalence of inexact proximal ALM and ADMM for a class of convex composite programming,"In this paper, we show that for a class of linearly constrained convex composite optimization problems, an (inexact) symmetric Gauss–Seidel based majorized multi-block proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is equivalent to an inexact proximal augmented Lagrangian method. This equivalence not only provides new perspectives for understanding some ADMM-type algorithms but also supplies meaningful guidelines on implementing them to achieve better computational efficiency. Even for the two-block case, a by-product of this equivalence is the convergence of the whole sequence generated by the classic ADMM with a step-length that exceeds the conventional upper bound of \((1+\sqrt{5})/2\), if one part of the objective is linear. This is exactly the problem setting in which the very first convergence analysis of ADMM was conducted by Gabay and Mercier (Comput Math Appl 2(1):17–40, 1976), but, even under notably stronger assumptions, only the convergence of the primal sequence was known. A collection of illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the breadth of applications for which our results can be used. Numerical experiments on solving a large number of linear and convex quadratic semidefinite programming problems are conducted to illustrate how the theoretical results established here can lead to improvements on the corresponding practical implementations.","Liang Chen

3106,Metric properties and exceptional sets of β-expansions over formal Laurent series,"This paper is concerned with the metric properties of β-expansions over the field of formal Laurent series. We will see that there are essential differences between β-expansions of the formal Laurent series case and the classical real case. Also the Hausdorff dimensions of some exceptional sets, with respect to the Haar measure, are determined.","Bing Li1, Jun Wu2 & Jian Xu",Monatshefte für Mathematik,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00605-008-0531-7,"2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 11K55, 11T60"
