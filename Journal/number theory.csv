Moreover, the 2-regular case is precisely the class of totally real number fields that have homotopy cartesian “Bökstedt square”, relating the K-theory of the 2-integers to that of the fields of real and complex numbers and finite fields.

40,Function Theories in Cayley-Dickson Algebras and Number Theory,"In the recent years a lot of effort has been made to extend the theory of hyperholomorphic functions from the setting of associative Clifford algebras to non-associative Cayley-Dickson algebras, starting with the octonions.An important question is whether there appear really essentially different features in the treatment with Cayley-Dickson algebras that cannot be handled in the Clifford analysis setting. Here we give one concrete example: Cayley-Dickson algebras admit the construction of direct analogues of so-called CM-lattices, in particular, lattices that are closed under multiplication.Canonical examples are lattices with components from the algebraic number fields \(\mathbb{Q}{[\sqrt{m1}, \ldots \sqrt{mk}]}\).

 has no nonnegative integer solution. Showing the interrelation of the original problem and discrete optimization we give lower bounds for this number using Gomory cuts which are tools for solving discrete programming problems.In the first section an important theorem is cited after some remarks. In Section 2 we state a parametric knapsack problem. The Frobenius problem is equivalent with finding the value of the parameter where the optimal objective function value is maximal. The basis of this reformulation is the above mentioned theorem. Gomory's cutting plane method is applied for the knapsack problem in Section 3. Only one cut is generated and we make one dual simplex step after cutting the linear programming optimum of the knapsack problem. Applying this result we gain lower bounds for the Frobenius problem in Section 4. In the last section we show that the bounds are sharp in the sense that there are examples with arbitrary many coefficients where the lower bounds and the exact solution of the Frobenius problem coincide.",B.

This is a written account of the lecture I gave then on some of the contributions by Indian mathematicians to Algebraic number theory from India’s independence to late 90’s.There has been a lot of work done in India during these years, and it will be impossible to report on all of it in limited space. We have therefore chosen some of the representative works from the vast literature reflecting to some extent the author’s taste. Since this was a report about work done in the country, works of several very prominent mathematicians from India during this period who worked for most of their scientific career outside India has been omitted. In particular, we do not speak about the work of S. Chowla who has contributed so much to so many areas of Algebraic number theory. We have also restricted ourselves to areas very closely related to Algebraic number theory, and have therefore omitted topics in transcendental and analytic number theory which was reported by others in the conference. We have also omitted from our consideration the arithmetic theory of algebraic groups. In particular, we do not speak on the work of K.G. Ramanathan who initiated the study of arithmetic groups in the country which has flourished into a very strong area of research at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai.We begin the report by listing the two major schools in the country where algebraic number theory has been pursued, and in each case list some of the mathematicians from these schools.

Two infinite families of identities are proved in this context using an interplay of combinatorial and q-series methods.

Even if there is in the literature a large number of works in which many properties of the gcd-sum function are studied, connections between the gcd-sum function and integer partitions have not been remarked so far. Our general results can be used to provide new connections between the partitions and many classical special arithmetic functions often studied in multiplicative number theory: the Möbius function \(\mu (n)\), Euler’s totient \(\varphi (n)\), Jordan’s totient \(J_k(n)\), Liouville’s function \(\lambda (n)\), the von Mangoldt function \(\Lambda (n)\), the divisor function \(\sigma _x(n)\), and others.","Mircea Merca

This allows to carry over the Einstein relation between mass and energy to a relation between the whole numbers M and N, where N is the number of summands in the partition ofM into positive summands, as well as to define the forbidding factor for the number M, and apply this to the Bohr–Kalckar model of heavy atomic nuclei and to the calculation of the maximal number of nucleons in the nucleus.",V.

60,Auxiliary functions in transcendental number theory,"We discuss the role of auxiliary functions in the development of transcendental number theory.Initially, auxiliary functions were completely explicit (Sect. 1). The earliest transcendence proof is due to Liouville (Sect. 1.1) who produced the first explicit examples of transcendental numbers at a time where their existence was not yet known; in his proof, the auxiliary function is just a polynomial in one variable. Hermite’s proof of the transcendence of e (1873) is much more involved, the auxiliary function he builds (Sect. 1.2) is the first example of the Padé approximants (Sect. 1.3), which can be viewed as a far reaching generalization of continued fraction expansion (Brezinski in Lecture Notes in Math., vol. 888. Springer, Berlin, 1981; and Springer Series in Computational Mathematics, vol. 12. Springer, Berlin, 1991). Hypergeometric functions (Sect. 1.4) are among the best candidates for using Padé approximations techniques.Another tool, which plays the role of auxiliary functions, is produced by interpolation formulae (Sect. 2). They occurred in the theory after a question by Weierstraß (Sect. 2.1) on the so-called exceptional set
S

f
 of a transcendental function f, which is the set of algebraic numbers α such that f(α) is algebraic. The answer to his question is that any set of algebraic numbers is the exceptional set of some transcendental function f; this shows that one should add further conditions in order to get transcendence criteria. One way is to replace algebraic number by rational integer: this gives rise to the study of integer–valued entire functions (Sect. 2.2) with the works of G. Pólya (1915), A.O. Gel’fond (1929) and many others. The connexion with transcendental number theory may not have been clear until the solution by A.O. Gel’fond in 1929 of the question of the transcendence of e
π, a special case of Hilbert’s seventh problem (Sect. 2.3). Along these lines, recent developments are due to T. Rivoal who renewed forgotten rational interpolation formulae (1935) of R. Lagrange (Sect. 2.4).The simple (but powerful) construction by Liouville was extended to several variables by A. Thue (Sect. 3.1.1) who introduced the Dirichlet’s box principle (pigeonhole principle) (Sect. 3) into the topic of Diophantine approximation in the early 1900s. In the 1920s, Siegel (Sect. 3.1) developed this idea and applied it in 1932 to transcendental number theory. This gave rise to the Gel’fond–Schneider method (Sect. 3.1.2), which produces the Schneider–Lang Criterion in one (Sect. 3.1.3) or several (Sect. 3.1.4) variables. Among many developments of this method are results on modular functions (Sect. 3.1.6). Variants of the auxiliary functions produced by Dirichlet’s Box Principle are universal auxiliary functions which have small Taylor coefficients at the origin (Sect. 3.2). Another approach, due to K. Mahler (Sect. 3.3), involves auxiliary functions whose existence is deduced from linear algebra instead of Thue–Siegel Lemma 3.1.In 1991, M. Laurent introduced interpolation determinants (Sect. 4). Two years later, J.B. Bost used Arakelov theory (Sect. 5) to prove slope inequalities, which dispenses of the choice of bases.",Michel Waldschmidt,The Ramanujan Journal,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11139-009-9204-y,"Transcendental number theory,Auxiliary functions,Exponential function,Pade approximation,Lagrange interpolation,Integer valued functions,Interpolation determinants,Six exponentials theorem,Modular functions,Liouville,Hermite,Weierstrass,Thue,Siegel,Gelfond,Schneider,Mahler,Baker"

64,Apollonian circle packings: Number theory II. Spherical and hyperbolic packings,"
Apollonian circle packings arise by repeatedly filling the interstices between mutually tangent circles with further tangent circles. In Euclidean space it is possible for every circle in such a packing to have integer radius of curvature, and we call such a packing an integral Apollonian circle packing. There are infinitely many different integral packings; these were studied in Part I (J. Number Theory 100, 1–45, 2003). Integral circle packings also exist in spherical and hyperbolic space, provided a suitable definition of curvature is used and again there are an infinite number of different integral packings. This paper studies number-theoretic properties of such packings. This amounts to studying the orbits of a particular subgroup 
\({\mathcal{A}}\) 
of the group of integral automorphs of the indefinite quaternary quadratic form 
\(Q_{{\mathcal{D}}}(w,x,y,z)=2(w^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})-(w+x+y+z)^{2}\)
. This subgroup, called the Apollonian group, acts on integer solutions 
\(Q_{{\mathcal{D}}}(w,x,y,z)=k\)
. This paper gives a reduction theory for orbits of 
\({\mathcal{A}}\) 
acting on integer solutions to 
\(Q_{{\mathcal{D}}}(w,x,y,z)=k\) 
valid for all integer k. It also classifies orbits for all k≡0 (mod 4) in terms of an extra parameter n and an auxiliary class group (depending on n and k), and studies congruence conditions on integers in a given orbit.

74,Analytic Number Theory and Statistics,In the study of an arithmetic function an one is often interested in the asymptotic behaviour of \(\sum_{n\leq X}\ a_n\) for large X. Indeed the study of such asymptotic behaviour is one of the defining goals of analytic number theory. For large classes of functions there is no theoretic machinery available. In such cases one resorts to experimental methods. These are discussed in this paper. In particular the “constant of proportionality” has often an intricate structure. To identify this constant one needs to be able to determine it as precisely as possible. One is then confronted with what is a statistical problem. We discuss here possible solutions to this problem and compare the accuracy of the results they yield.,Samuel Patterson,Computational Methods and Function Theory,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03321706,"Arithmetic functions,asymptotic behaviour,Tauberian theorems,numerical estimation,complete exponential sums"

Our construction is general and associates to an inclusion of rings (under a suitable finiteness assumption) an inclusion of discrete groups (the associated ax+b groups) and the corresponding Hecke algebras of bi-invariant functions. The latter algebra is endowed with a canonical one parameter group of automorphisms measuring the lack of normality of the subgroup. The inclusion of rings ℤ⊂ℚ provides the desiredC*-dynamical system, which admits the ζ function as partition function and the Galois group Gal(ℚcycl/ℚ) of the cyclotomic extension ℚcycl of ℚ as symmetry group. Moreover, it exhibits a phase transition with spontaneous symmetry breaking at inverse temperature β=1 (cf. [Bos-C]). The original motivation for these results comes from the work of B.

79,Fiber bundle description of number scaling in gauge theory and geometry,"This work uses fiber bundles as a framework to describe some effects of number scaling on gauge theory and some geometric quantities. A description of number scaling and fiber bundles over a flat space time manifold, M, is followed by a description of gauge theory. A fiber at point x of M contains a pair of scaled complex number and vector space structures, \(\bar{C}^{c}_{x}\times \bar{V}^{c}_{x},\) for each c in GL(1, C). A space time dependent scalar field, g, determines, for each x, the scaling value of the vector space structure that contains the value, \(\psi (x)\), of a vector field at x. Vertical components of connections between neighboring fibers are taken to be the gradient field, \(\mathbf {A}(x)+i\mathbf {B}(x),\) of g. Abelian gauge theory for these fields gives the result that \(\mathbf {B}\) is massless, and no mass restrictions for \(\mathbf {A}\). Addition of an electromagnetic field does not change these results. In the Mexican hat Higgs mechanism \(\mathbf {B}\) combines with a Goldstone boson to create massive vector bosons, the photon field, and the Higgs field. For geometric quantities the fiber bundle is a tangent bundle with pairs, \(\bar{R}^{r}_{x}\times \bar{T}^{r}_{x}\) for each x and nonnegative real r. \(\mathbf {B}\) is zero everywhere. The \(\mathbf {A}\) field affects path lengths and the proper times of clocks along paths. It also appears in the geodesic equation. The lack of physical evidence for the gradient g field means that either it couples very weakly to matter fields, or that it is close to zero for all x in a local region of cosmological space and time. It says nothing about the values outside the local region.",Paul Benioff,Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40509-015-0049-3,"Number scaling,Fiber bundles,Gauge theory,Geometry"

ℝ. Our results substantiate that most likely it does not any longer capture the difficulty of NP
ℝ in such a real number setting. More precisely, we give upper complexity bounds for the approximation problem for interval functions by locating it in (a real analogue of). This result allows several conclusions:• the problem is not (any more) NP
ℝ-hard under so called weak polynomial time reductions and likely not to be NP
ℝ-hard under (full) polynomial time reductions;• for fixed dimension the problem is polynomial time solvable; this extends the results in Koshelev et al.

98,"Seven pivotal theorems of Fourier analysis, signal analysis, numerical analysis and number theory: their interconnections","The present paper deals mainly with seven fundamental theorems of mathematical analysis, numerical analysis, and number theory, namely the generalized Parseval decomposition formula (GPDF), introduced 15 years ago, the well-known approximate sampling theorem (ASF), the new approximate reproducing kernel theorem, the basic Poisson summation formula, already known to Gauß, a newer version of the GPDF having a structure similar to that of the Poisson summation formula, namely, the Parseval decomposition–Poisson summation formula, the functional equation of Riemann’s zeta function, as well as the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula. It will in fact be shown that these seven theorems are all equivalent to one another, in the sense that each is a corollary of the others. Since these theorems can all be deduced from each other, one of them has to be proven independently in order to verify all. It is convenient to choose the ASF, introduced in 1963. The epilogue treats possible extensions to the more general contexts of reproducing kernel theory and of abstract harmonic analysis, using locally compact abelian groups. This paper is expository in the sense that it treats a number of mathematical theorems, their interconnections, their equivalence to one another. On the other hand, the proofs of the many intricate interconnections among these theorems are new in their essential steps and conclusions.","P. L. Butzer1, M. M. Dodson2, P. J. S. G. Ferreira3, J.

RIMS Kôkyûroku Bessatsu, vol B51, pp. 301–346, 2014). Some important developments which preceded (Inter-universal Teichmüller theory I–IV, 2012–2015) are presented in the first section. Several important aspects of arithmetic deformation theory are discussed in the second section. Its main theorem gives an inequality–bound on the size of volume deformation associated to a certain log-theta-lattice. The application to several fundamental conjectures in number theory follows from a further direct computation of the right hand side of the inequality. The third section considers additional related topics, including practical hints on how to study the theory.",Ivan Fesenko,European Journal of Mathematics,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40879-015-0066-0,"Inter-universal Teichmüller theory,Arithmetic deformation,Key conjectures in Diophantine geometry,Fundamental groups,Mono-anabelian geometry,Nonarchimedean theta function and its special values,Deconstruction and Reconstruction of ring structures,Theta-links,Log-theta-lattice"
105,Minimum numbers and Wecken theorems in topological coincidence theory. I,"Minimum numbers measure the obstruction to removing coincidences of two given maps (between smooth manifolds M and N of dimensions m and n, resp.). In this paper, we compare them to four distinct types of Nielsen numbers. These agree with the classical Nielsen number when m = n (e.g., in the fixed point setting where M = N and one of the maps is the identity map). However, in higher codimensions, m − n > 0, their definitions and computations involve distinct aspects of differential topology and homotopy theory.We develop tools which help us (1) to decide when a minimum number is equal to a Nielsen number (“Wecken theorem”), and (2) to determine Nielsen numbers. Here certain homotopy theoretical criteria play a central role. E.g., failures of the “Wecken condition” (cf. Definition 1.18 below) can have very interesting geometric consequences. The selfcoincidence case where the two maps are homotopic turns out to be particularly illuminating.We give many concrete applications in special settings where M or N are spheres, spherical space forms, projective spaces, tori, Stiefel manifolds or Grassmannians. Already in the simplest examples an important role is played, e.g., by Kervaire invariants, all versions of Hopf invariants (à la James, Hilton, 
Ganea, . . . ) and the elements in the stable homotopy of spheres defined by invariantly framed Lie groups.",Ulrich Koschorke,Journal of Fixed Point Theory and Applications,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11784-011-0058-8,"Primary 54H25,55M20,Secondary 55P35,55Q25,55Q40"

107,Analogue of a Fock-type integral arising from electromagnetism and its applications in number theory,"Closed-form evaluations of certain integrals of \(J_{0}(\xi )\), the Bessel function of the first kind, have been crucial in the studies on the electromagnetic field of alternating current in a circuit with two groundings, as can be seen from the works of Fock and Bursian, Schermann, etc. Koshliakov’s generalization of one such integral, which contains \(J_s(\xi )\) in the integrand, encompasses several important integrals in the literature including Sonine’s integral. Here, we derive an analogous integral identity where \(J_{s}(\xi )\) is replaced by a kernel consisting of a combination of \(J_{s}(\xi )\), \(K_{s}(\xi )\) and \(Y_{s}(\xi )\). This kernel is important in number theory because of its role in the Voronoï summation formula for the sum-of-divisors function \(\sigma _s(n)\). Using this identity and the Voronoï summation formula, we derive a general transformation relating infinite series of products of Bessel functions \(I_{\lambda }(\xi )\) and \(K_{\lambda }(\xi )\) with those involving the Gaussian hypergeometric function. As applications of this transformation, several important results are derived, including what we believe to be a corrected version of the first identity found on page 336 of Ramanujan’s Lost Notebook.",Atul Dixit1 & Arindam Roy,Research in the Mathematical Sciences,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40687-020-00223-6,"Bessel functions,Generalized sum-of-divisors function,Voronoï summation formula,Analytic continuation"

111,The relation between Markov process theory and Kolmogoroff's theory of turbulence and the extension of Kolmogoroff's laws,"The whole paper consists of two parts (Part I and Part II). In part I, we shall analyze the relation between the two theories of turbulence involving large Reynolds number: the Markov process theory from the Lagrangian point of view and Kolmogoroff's theory from the Eulerian point of view. It will be pointed out that the Reynolds number needed for the Markovian description of turbulence should be as large as that needed for Kolmogoroff's second hypothesis, that the eddies of the period of order T1 (the self-correlation time scale of the random velocity u) and the eddies of the period of order T1 (the self-correlation time scale of the random force f) correspond to the energy-containing eddies and the eddies in the dissipation range respectively, and that T*⩽t≪β−1, the time interval for the applicability of Richardson's law during twoparticle's dispersion, corresponds to the inertial subrange in Kolmogoroff's theory. Thus, these two theories reflect the property of the turbulence involving very large Reynolds number arguing from different aspects.In Part II, by using physical analysis in Part I, we shall establish in a certain way the quantitative relation between these two theories. In terms of this relation and the results of the study of two-particle's dispersion motion, we shall obtain the structure functions, the correlation functions and the energy spectrum, which are appliciable not only to the inertial subrange, but also to the whole range with the wave number less than that in the inertial subrange. Kolmogoroff's “2/3 law” and ”−5/3 law” are the asymptotic solutions with respect to the present result in the inertial subrange. Thus, the present result is an extension of Kolmogoroff's laws.",Yue Zeng-yuan1 & Zhang Bin,Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,1982,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01895339,"Reynolds Number,Correlation Function,Energy Spectrum,Structure Function,Asymptotic Solution"
112,"The problem of the invariance of dimension in the growth of modern topology, part II","This work examines the historical origins of topological dimension theory with special reference to the problem of the invariance of dimension. Part I, comprising chapters 1–4, concerns problems and ideas about dimension from ancient times to about 1900. Chapter 1 deals with ancient Greek ideas about dimension and the origins of theories of hyperspaces and higher-dimensional geometries relating to the subsequent development of dimension theory. Chapter 2 treatsCantor's surprising discovery that continua of different dimension numbers can be put into one-one correspondence and his discussion withDedekind concerning the discovery. The problem of the invariance of dimension originates with this discovery. Chapter 3 deals with the early efforts of 1878–1879 to prove the invariance of dimension. Chapter 4 sketches the rise of point set topology with reference to the problem of proving dimensional invariance and the development of dimension theory. Part II, comprising chapters 5–8, concerns the development of dimension theory during the early part of the twentieth century. Chapter 5 deals with new approaches to the concept of dimension and the problem of dimensional invariance. Chapter 6 analyses the origins ofBrouwer's interest in topology and his breakthrough to the first general proof of the invariance of dimension. Chapter 7 treatsLebesgue's ideas about dimension and the invariance problem and the dispute that arose betweenBrouwer andLebesgue which led toBrouwer's further work on topology and dimension. Chapter 8 offers glimpses of the development of dimension theory afterBrouwer, especially the development of the dimension theory ofUrysohn andMenger during the twenties. Chapter 8 ends with some concluding remarks about the entire history covered.",Dale M.

122,Processor sharing: A survey of the mathematical theory,"During last few decades the Egalitarian Processor Sharing (EPS) has gained a prominent role in applied probability, especially, in queueing theory and its computer applications. While the EPS paradigm emerged in 1967 as an idealization of round-robin (RR) scheduling algorithm in time-sharing computer systems, it has recently capture renewed interest as a powerful concept for modeling WEB servers. This paper summarizes the most important results concerning the exact solutions for the M/GI/1 queue with egalitarian processor sharing. The material is drawn, mainly, from recent authors’ papers which are supplemented, in small degree, by other related results. Many of the further results are established under the direct influence of our earlier papers. Our main purpose is to give a survey of state-of-the-art with regard to main achievements of the contemporary theory of the M/GI/1 queueing system with processor sharing. The focus is on the methods and techniques of exact and asymptotic analysis of this queueing system. In contrast to the standard surveys, the abridged proofs (or their ideas) of some key theorems and corollaries are included in the paper. We outline recent developments in exact analysis of the M/GI/1-EPS queue with further emphasis on time-dependent (transient) probability distributions of the main characteristics. In particular, the present paper includes the results on the joint time-dependent distribution of the sojourn time of a job arriving at time t with the service demand (length) u, and of the number of jobs at time t- in the M/GI/1 queue with egalitarian processor sharing, which obtained in form of multiple transforms. We also show how the non-stationary solutions can be used to obtain known and new results which allow to predict the behaviour of the EPS queue and to yield additional insights into its new unexpected properties. We also discuss a number of limit theorems arising under the study of the processor sharing queues.",S. F. Yashkov1 & A. S.

For the main boundary-value problem and the Euler-Lagrange boundary-value problem, we consider the existence and uniqueness of the solution, the continuous dependence of the solution on boundary-value and initial-value conditions, and the “roughness” of functional differential equations in the considered boundary-value problems. For functional differential equations of pointwise type we also investigate the pointwise completeness of the space of solutions for given boundary-value conditions, give an estimate of the rank for the space of solutions, describe types of degeneration for the space of solutions, and establish conditions for the “smoothness” of the solution.

132,A systematic review of uncertainty theory with the use of scientometrical method,"Uncertainty theory is an area in axiomatic mathematics recently proposed by Professor Baoding Liu and aiming to deal with belief degrees. Retrieving 1004 journal articles from the Web of Science database between 2008 and 2019, and utilizing CiteSpace and Pajek software, we analyze the publications per year and by geographical distribution, productive scholars and their cooperation, key journals, highly cited articles and main paths of the field. In this way, seven key sub-fields of uncertainty theory and their research potential are derived. The results show the following: (1) The literature on uncertainty theory follows a linear growth trend, involves an extensive network of 1000 scholars worldwide and is published in 300 journals, indicating thus that uncertainty theory has become increasingly attractive, and its academic influence is gradually expanding. (2) Seven key sub-fields of uncertainty theory have clearly been identified, including the axiomatic system, uncertain programming, uncertain sets, uncertain logic, uncertain differential equations, uncertain risk analysis, and uncertain processes. Among them, uncertain differential equations and programming are the two main sub-fields with the largest numbers of published papers. Furthermore, for evaluating the research potential of sub-fields, maturity and recent attention indicators are calculated using the citations, total number of publications, quantity of most cited literature and half-life. Based on these indicators, uncertain processes shows the greatest development potential, and has remained a hot topic in recent years, being mainly concentrated on the uncertain renewal reward process, optimal control of discrete-time uncertain systems, and uncertain linear quadratic optimal control. Additionally, uncertain risk analysis is ranked second, and focuses on the analysis of expected losses, investment risk, and structural reliability of uncertain systems.","Jian Zhou1, Yujiao Jiang1, Athanasios A.

140,“Astonishing Successes” and “Bitter Disappointment”: The Specific Heat of Hydrogen in Quantum Theory,"The specific heat of hydrogen gas at low temperatures was first measured in 1912 by Arnold Eucken in Walther Nernst’s laboratory in Berlin, and provided one of the earliest experimental supports for the new quantum theory. Even earlier, Nernst had developed a quantum theory of rotating diatomic gas molecules that figured in the discussions at the first Solvay conference in late 1911. Between 1913 and 1925, Albert Einstein, Paul Ehrenfest, Max Planck, Fritz Reiche, and Erwin Schrödinger, among many others, attempted theoretical descriptions of the rotational specific heat of hydrogen, with only limited success. Quantum theory also was central to the study of molecular spectra, where initially it was more successful. Moreover, the two problems interacted in sometimes surprising ways. Not until 1927, following Werner Heisenberg’s discovery of the behavior of indistinguishable particles in modern quantum mechanics, did American theorist David Dennison find a successful theory of the specific heat of hydrogen.",Clayton A.

$$\frac{g}{{2f c_0 (1 - g)^{2^ -  } }} = \frac{{s_1 }}{r} + \frac{{s_1 s_2 }}{{2!r^2 }} + ... + \frac{{s_1 s_2 ...s_j }}{{j!r^j }},$$

When S have holes, we defined two moduli spaces closely related to the moduli spaces of G-local systems on S. We show that they carry a lot of interesting structures. In particular we define a distinguished collection of coordinate systems, equivariant under the action of the mapping class group of S. We prove that their transition functions are subtraction free. Thus we have positive structures on these moduli spaces. Therefore we can take their points with values in any positive semifield. Their positive real points provide the two higher Teichmüller spaces related to G and S, while the points with values in the tropical semifields provide the lamination spaces.

The motivation for studying this problem is that it is known by recent results due to G. Frey and E. Kani that knowledge of this asymptotic behaviour can lead to statements of existence of curves of genus 2 with elliptic differentials in particular cases.We give a general, and from one point of view complete, answer to this question on asymptotic behaviour. This answer is derived from a theorem concerning the number of representations of a natural number by certain quaternary quadratic forms.

171,Quantum mechanics as a deterministic theory of a continuum of worlds,"A non-relativistic quantum mechanical theory is proposed that describes the universe as a continuum of worlds whose mutual interference gives rise to quantum phenomena. A logical framework is introduced to properly deal with propositions about objects in a multiplicity of worlds. In this logical framework, the continuum of worlds is treated in analogy to the continuum of time points; both “time” and “world” are considered as mutually independent modes of existence. The theory combines elements of Bohmian mechanics and of Everett’s many-worlds interpretation; it has a clear ontology and a set of precisely defined postulates from where the predictions of standard quantum mechanics can be derived. Probability as given by the Born rule emerges as a consequence of insufficient knowledge of observers about which world it is that they live in. The theory describes a continuum of worlds rather than a single world or a discrete set of worlds, so it is similar in spirit to many-worlds interpretations based on Everett’s approach, without being actually reducible to these. In particular, there is no splitting of worlds, which is a typical feature of Everett-type theories. Altogether, the theory explains (1) the subjective occurrence of probabilities, (2) their quantitative value as given by the Born rule, and (3) the apparently random “collapse of the wavefunction” caused by the measurement, while still being an objectively deterministic theory.","Kim Joris Boström

174,Studies in Babylonian Lunar Theory: Part II. Treatments of Lunar Anomaly,"This paper is the second of a multi-part examination of the creation of the Babylonian mathematical lunar theories known as Systems A and B. Part I (Britton 2007) addressed the development of the empirical elements needed to separate the effects of lunar and solar anomaly on the intervals between syzygies. This was accomplished in the construction of the System A lunar theory by an unknown author, almost certainly in the city of Babylon and probably early in the 4th century B.C. The present paper focuses mainly on System A and the likely process of its construction. The first three sections are largely descriptive – first of the basic concepts which underlie the theory; then of the component schemes comprising the theory; and finally of two distinctive texts which suggest how the theory was constructed. The crux of the paper is Sect. 4, which describes how the theory seems likely to have been constructed. Here the crucial insight in separating the effects of lunar and solar anomaly appears to have been recognizing that – of all the measurable intervals bounded by eclipses – only 235 months exhibits a variation due solely to lunar anomaly, and that by means of an elegant mathematical model the amplitudes of 223 and 12 months could be deduced from its amplitude. The rest of the section describes the likely details of the derivation of the Φ ~ Λ scheme, and the extension of the methodology to the other components of the theory. It concludes with a demonstration that Φ and its dependent schemes were anchored through the Φ ~ W scheme to the syzygy on –403 Aug 18 (GN 7391) which concluded the shortest 6-month interval in the first 24 saros cycles since –746 (and in fact in the 900 years separating Nabonassar and Ptolemy). The next three sections address a number of largely technical details and amplifications of the theory, beginning with the schemes describing the variation of lunar velocity (column F) in Sect. 5. Section 6 addresses issues concerning the interpretation of Φ and the so-call Saros Text (BM 36705), while Sect. 7 discusses System B’s corresponding treatment of the effects of lunar anomaly, illustrating both its derivative nature and mathematically less rigorous structure. Section 8 examines the accuracy of the two theories, showing that the System A theory was both remarkably accurate and superior to System B. The final section offers some brief remarks on the power and elegance of the mathematical treatment of the problem by the author of System A.",John P.

175,Isologous diversification: A theory of cell differentiation,"An isologous diversification theory for cell differentiation is proposed, based on simulations of interacting cells with biochemical networks and the cell division process following consumption of some chemicals. According to the simulations of the interaction-based dynamical systems model, the following scenario of the cell differentiation is proposed. (1) Up to some threshold number, divisions bring about almost identical cells with synchronized biochemical oscillations. (2) As the number is increased, the oscillations lose synchrony, leading to groups of cells with different phases of oscilaations. (3) Amplitudes of oscillation and averaged chemical compositions start to differ by groups of cells. The differentiated behavior of states is transmitted to daughter cells. (4) Recursivity is formed so that the daughter cells keep the identical chemical character. This “memory” is made possible through the transfer of initial conditions. (5) Successive differentiation proceeds.The mechanism of tumor cell formation, origin of stem cells, anomalous differentiation by transplantations, apoptosis and other features of cell differentiation process are also discussed, with some novel predictions.",Kunihiko Kaneko1 & Tetsuya Yomo,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,1997,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02459474,"Daughter Cell,Chemical Concentration,Dynamical System Theory,Cell Index,Division Process"
176,A foliated analogue of one- and two-dimensional Arakelov theory,The analogy between number fields and Riemann surfaces was an important source of motivation for mathematicians in the last century. We improve and extend this analogy by substituting Riemann surfaces with certain foliations by Riemann surfaces. In particular we show that coverings of these foliations lead to formulas having the same structure as formulas describing number field extensions. We also study higher dimensional foliations which have properties analogous to arithmetic surfaces. This provides more evidence for a conjecture of Deninger.,Fabian Kopei,Abhandlungen aus dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universität Hamburg,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12188-011-0061-4,"Foliation,Arakelov theory,Complex analysis"

Parabolic flows, a type of one-dimensional lattice dynamics, evolve singular braid diagrams in such a way as to decrease their topological complexity; algebraic lengths decrease monotonically. This topological invariant is derived from a Morse-Conley homotopy index.¶In the second half of the paper we apply this technology to second order Lagrangians via a discrete formulation of the variational problem.

D, define the α-th derived set \(E^{(\alpha)}_D\) of E with respect to D by \((E^{(\alpha-1)}_D)^{(1)}_D\) if α has an immediate predecessor and by \({\mathop \bigcap\limits_{\beta<\alpha}} E^{(\beta)}_D\) if α is a limit ordinal.

200,"Theory of biological similarities, nondimensional parameters and invariant numbers","In previous papers (1955–1957) a theory of biological similarity was established, assuming that the limits are the mechanical and the electrodynamical similarity criteria. The range of this theory lies between the coefficient of the time exponent (γ) for mechanical (0.5γ) and electrodynamical (1.0γ) similarities, being the mode 0.93γ. Moreover, for certain functions this restricted theoretical range should be extended to the hydrodynamical similarity criterion (2γ), so that the dimensionless numbers commonly used in Physics (Reynolds, Froude, Weber, etc.) can be included within the total range (0.5–2γ) of biological similarities. From dimensional analysis of physiological, functions it was possible to obtain, by means of dimensional and solution matrices, a group of “nondimensional numbers” by applying Buckingham's Pi-theorem. Nevertheless, only if a single similarity criterion was applied, the residual weight exponent was exactly zero; in all other instances the weight exponent was not zero, due to the existence of a range for biological similarities and to the statistical meaning of exponent (b) of the allometric equations. From the similarity criteria “invariant numbers” can be obtained, by means of which it is possible to establish correlations between numerous morphological and physiological characteristics of a particular system (circulation, respiration, metabolism, etc.).",B.

From a sample of the data obtained, it is desired to infer the distribution of cell size, cell granularity and occupancy of cell surface receptors, by constructing histograms for the variables of interest. Often an attempt is made, for instance, to account for the changes in shape of these histograms in terms of alterations in gene expression, etc. In this paper we analyse the way that changes in the sample histograms can be interpreted in three frequently encountered situations, namely (a) when there is one cell line exposed to alterations in chemical potential of ligand, (b) when there are two cell lines exposed separately to saturating concentrations of the same ligand, and (c) when two ligands are added in saturating amounts, first separately, then together, to the same cell line. We demonstrate that, under a wide range of assumptions, the change in histogram shape can be accounted for in terms of a proportionate and absolute component and examples are given to illustrate this.

Understanding their evolutions can lead to better software engineering practices. In this paper, the authors use complex network theory as a tool to analyze the evolution of object-oriented (OO) software from a multigranularity perspective. First, a multi-granularity software networks model is proposed to represent the topological structures of a multi-version software system from three levels of granularity. Then, some parameters widely used in complex network theory are applied to characterize the software networks. By tracing the parameters’ values in consecutive software systems, we have a better understanding about software evolution. A case study is conducted on an open source OO project, Azureus, as an example to illustrate our approach, and some underlying evolution characteristics are uncovered. These results provide a different dimension to our understanding of software evolutions and also are very useful for the design and development of OO software systems.","Weifeng Pan1,2, Bing Li1,3,4, Yutao Ma1,3 & …Jing Liu1,",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-011-0319-z,"Complex networks,multi-granularity,software evolution,software system"

213,A mixture theory model of fluid and solute transport in the microvasculature of normal and malignant tissues. I. Theory,"In order to better understand the mechanisms governing transport of drugs, nanoparticle-based treatments, and therapeutic biomolecules, and the role of the various physiological parameters, a number of mathematical models have previously been proposed. The limitations of the existing transport models indicate the need for a comprehensive model that includes transport in the vessel lumen, the vessel wall, and the interstitial space and considers the effects of the solute concentration on fluid flow. In this study, a general model to describe the transient distribution of fluid and multiple solutes at the microvascular level was developed using mixture theory. The model captures the experimentally observed dependence of the hydraulic permeability coefficient of the capillary wall on the concentration of solutes present in the capillary wall and the surrounding tissue. Additionally, the model demonstrates that transport phenomena across the capillary wall and in the interstitium are related to the solute concentration as well as the hydrostatic pressure. The model is used in a companion paper to examine fluid and solute transport for the simplified case of an axisymmetric geometry with no solid deformation or interconversion of mass.","M. M.

214,Calculations on the cascade theory with collision loss,A rigorous solution of the equations of the cascade theory taking the radiation and pair creation cross-sections to be those for complete screening and the collision loss to be a constant is given which exactly satisfies the given boundary conditions at the surface of the layer. The solution is in the form of an infinite series but it is not a series in powers of the collision loss β since this enters essentially into the expression for each term. The first term of the series alone gives the whole energy spectrum of cascade electrons both above and below the critical energy with very considerable accuracy. The total number of particles produced at a deptht by an electron of initial energy E0= β exp. y0 is given in Table III fort varying from 2 to 30 and y0 from 3 to 16. It is shown that at the maximum of the cascade the total number of particles above the critical energy is 0.8 times the number below the critical energy.,H. J. Bhabha & S. K.

The distribution function of ϕ determines the ratio μ of the individuals in the society who adopt a given behavior. When the size of the social group is not too large, the actual distribution of ϕ will deviate from the most probable one, and therefore communities of the same size and having the same parameters may have different values of μ. Approximate equations are developed which give the probability of a given μ for a group of a given size. Possible effects of interactions of communities of different sizes are briefly discussed. A generalization of the theory of imitative behavior to any number of mutually exclusive behaviors is given, and its possible sociological implications are discussed.",N.

221,On the genesis of the Cartan–Kähler theory,"The theory of exterior differential systems plays a crucial role in Cartan’s whole mathematical production. As he once recognized, all the germs of his subsequent work were contained there. Indeed, it provided him with powerful technical tools that turned out to be very useful in many different fields such as the theory of partial differential equations, the theory of infinite dimensional Lie groups (Lie pseudogroups) and differential geometry. Nevertheless, scarce attention has been paid to this area of historical research thus far. Although authoritative scholars have investigated the foundation of exterior differential calculus in Cartan’s early papers, no specific analysis of Cartan’s subsequent works laying the foundations of what nowadays is known as the Cartan–Kähler theory has been yet provided. This article represents a first attempt to remedy this unsatisfactory state of affairs by focusing on Cartan’s work on Pfaffian systems at the very beginning of the past century. The analysis of Cartan’s relevant papers is preceded by a description of the historical context in which such contributions were conceived. In this respect, special emphasis will be put on some works by Engel and von Weber on Pfaffian systems, which laid the basis for the subsequent geometrical developments of Cartan’s theory of exterior differential systems.",Alberto Cogliati,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-011-0081-6,"Differential System,Linear Complex,Integral Variety,Characteristic Element,Integral Element"

The models are based on the assumption that polymeric chains form bridges between the fibrils, thereby providing the long range interactions responsible for the quasi-ordered spatial disposition of the fibrils. The theory is applied to rabbit cornea for which an empirical radial distribution has been obtained previously by analysis of electron micrographs. General agreement is found between theory and experiment for parameter values that are thought to be representative of stroma. The analysis constitutes a step toward the development of the physical basis of the ultrastructure of connective tissue and the way in which that structure affects physiological behavior.",R. A.

227,Thin-ship theory and influence of rake and flare,"The basic computational task of the thin-ship theory of free-surface potential flow about a ship that advances at constant speed along a straight path in calm water, of large depth and lateral extent, is considered. Specifically, a straightforward method for evaluating the pressure and the wave profile at a ship hull (the wave drag, hydrodynamic lift and pitch moment, and sinkage and trim are also considered) in accordance with Michell’s thin-ship theory is given. A main ingredient of this method is a simple analytical approximation to the local-flow component in the expression for the Green function (associated with the classical Michell–Kelvin linearized free-surface boundary condition) of thin-ship theory. This practical Green function is used to evaluate and analyze steady flow about a four-parameter family of ship bows with rake and flare. In particular, the variations of the bow-wave height and location with respect to the draft-based Froude number, the entrance angles at the top and bottom waterlines, and the rake angle are explored via a systematic parametric study. This parametric study provides estimates—immediately useful for design—of the influence of rake and flare on the height and the location of a ship bow wave, and shows that rake and flare effects can be significant, especially at low Froude numbers.","Francis Noblesse1, Gerard Delhommeau2, Hyun Yul Kim3 & …Chi Yang",Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-008-9247-x,"Bow flare,Bow rake,Green function,Ship bow wave,Thin-ship theory"

The adoption of lunar velocity,"This paper investigates the methods of eclipse prediction in China before the fourth century AD, with a detailed example of the eclipse theory in the Jing chu li (Luminous Inception System ). As the official calendar of the Jin dynasty and the Kingdom Wei during the three kingdoms period, the Jing chu li was used for more than 200 years after it was adopted in 237 AD. From the San tong li (Triple Concordance System ) of the Western Han to the Jing chu li, methods for predicting eclipses developed in three important ways: (i) from predicting only lunar eclipses to the prediction of both solar and lunar eclipses; (ii) from relying only on the mean periods of the sun and the moon to taking into consideration the variation in lunar velocity; and (iii) from estimating only a rough date to predicting the exact time of eclipses. This paper addresses two questions: first, how did ancient Chinese astronomers use cycles to predict eclipses in the Han dynasty? Second, how did astronomers such as Liu Hong  and Yang Wei  revise early eclipse prediction methods? The original text of the Jing chu li is analyzed to show how Yang Wei combined lunar velocity theory with the traditional method of predicting eclipses using cycles.",Yuzhen Guan,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-014-0146-4,"Solar Eclipse,Full Moon,Lunar Eclipse,Astronomical Phenomenon,Eclipse Period"

239,The education of Walter Kohn and the creation of density functional theory,"The theoretical solid-state physicist Walter Kohn was awarded one-half of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his mid-1960s creation of an approach to the many-particle problem in quantum mechanics called density functional theory (DFT). In its exact form, DFT establishes that the total charge density of any system of electrons and nuclei provides all the information needed for a complete description of that system. This was a breakthrough for the study of atoms, molecules, gases, liquids, and solids. Before DFT, it was thought that knowledge of the vastly more complicated many-electron wave function was essential for a complete description of such systems. Today, 50 years after its introduction, DFT (in one of its approximate forms) is the method of choice used by most scientists to calculate the physical properties of materials of all kinds. In this paper, I present a biographical essay of Kohn’s educational experiences and professional career up to and including the creation of DFT. My account begins with Kohn’s student years in Austria, England, and Canada during World War II and continues with his graduate and postgraduate training at Harvard University and Niels Bohr’s Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen. I then study the research choices he made during the first 10 years of his career (when he was a faculty member at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and a frequent visitor to the Bell Telephone Laboratories) in the context of the theoretical solid-state physics agenda of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Subsequent sections discuss his move to the University of California, San Diego, identify the research issue which led directly to DFT, and analyze the two foundational papers of the theory. The paper concludes with an explanation of how the chemists came to award “their” Nobel Prize to the physicist Kohn and a discussion of why he was unusually well suited to create the theory in the first place.",Andrew Zangwill,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-014-0140-x,"Variational Principle,Local Density Approximation,American Physical Society,Hartree Equation,Bell Telephone Laboratory"

This theory can be used to determine if certain events modeled by those systems reach a steady state. In this work we formalize the idea of a “stabilizable” discrete dynamical system. We present necessary and sufficient conditions for a Boolean monomial dynamical control system to be stabilizable in terms of properties of the dependency graph associated with the system. We use the equivalence of periodicity of the dependency graph and loop numbers to develop a new O(n
2logn) algorithm for determining the loop numbers of the strongly connected components of the dependency graph, and hence a new O(n
2logn) algorithm for determining when a Boolean monomial dynamical system is a fixed point system. Finally, we show how this result can be used to determine if a Boolean monomial dynamical control system is stabilizable in time O(n

Then (1) the theory T+ECT is conservative over T with respect to the class of AEN formulas; (2) the theory T+ECT+M is conservative over T+M{su−} with respect to the class of AEN formulas. Here ECT stands for the extended Church’s thesis, Mis the strong Markov principle, and M{su−} is the weak Markov principle. The following partial conservativeness properties are also proved: (3) T+ECT+M is conservative over T with respect to the class of negative arithmetic formulas; (4) the classical theory ZF2 is conservative over ZFI2C with respect to the class of negative arithmetic formulas.",A.

243,Features of the Logic-and-Probabilistic Risk Theory with Groups of Incompatible Events,"The propositions and characteristics of the logic-and-probabilistic theory of unsuccess risk with groups of incompatible events were presented, as well as examples of unsuccess risk scenarios and logic and probabilistic models. The problem of identification (training) of the risk logic-and-probabilistic model from the statistical data was stated, and a training algorithm was set forth. Statistical, combinatorial, and logic-and-probabilistic methods of risk analysis were described. High precision and robustness of the logic-and-probabilistic models of unsuccess risk were explained, and in terms of these characteristics the models were compared with other theories of risk and classification of objects. The results obtained can be used for modeling, analysis, and management of risks in complex organizational and technical systems.",E. D.

On the one hand, we offer a precise contextualization of this theory by considering it against its nineteenth-century geometrical background. Specifically, we examine some crucial steps in the emergence of the modern theory of geometrical equivalence. On the other hand, we analyze from a more conceptual perspective the significance of Hilbert’s theory of area for the foundational program pursued in Foundations. We argue that this theory played a fundamental role in the general attempt to provide a new independent basis for Euclidean geometry. Furthermore, we contend that our examination proves relevant for understanding the requirement of “purity of the method” in the tradition of modern synthetic geometry.","Eduardo N. Giovannini

254,Genetic control theory of developmental events,"An earlier theory of cell differentiation and morphogenesis (Wassermann, 1972, 1973, 1978) is combined with the genetic control model of Davidson and Britten (e.g. 1979). The resulting new theory suggests how, bysystematic process algorithms, specifically enumerated combinations of batteries of structural genes can become switched on in particularly enumerated cells, via battery-specific enumerable regulator genes. The systematization is idealized. Up to a certain stage of development in each mitotically arising cell a unique cell-specific combination of structural genes called ‘marker genes’ is active. Marker genes are assumed to code for cell-specifying marker proteins (CSMPs) which permit cells carrying related markers to recognize each other, thus permitting specific cell sorting.Batteries of marker genes could ensure great developmental precision and can safeguard—via redundancies of CSMP types—against accidental loss or detrimental mutational modification of CSMPs or marker genes, respectively. This paper is much concerned with cell lineage in relation to ‘microdifferentiation’, where ‘microdifferentiation’ of a cell refers to a cell's active marker genes and its syntheses of CSMPs. A drastic distinction is made between ‘microdifferentiation’ and ‘gross’ differentiation of a cell, where the same ‘gross’ differentiation may be shared by a large number of cells that could each be uniquely ‘microdifferentiated’. Typical ‘gross’ differentiation could manifest itself in tissue specificity, whereas, up to certain stages of development, all cells of the same gross differentiation type (say tissue specificity) could each be uniquely ‘microdifferentiated’. The theory also assumes that at certain stages of the developmental process some (or in some organisms all) of the previously uniquely specified cells could give rise to small (or occasionally large) clones of equispecified cells, some of which might form clusters that represent complete ‘morphogenetic fields’ Tentative implementation mechanisms are proposed which suggest how the theory could operate in molecular biological terms. In particular, CSMPs could endow cell surface membranes with a highly specific protein network, and an associated equally specific cell surface coat. It is suggested how these highly specified cell surface coats and other systems could provide an ‘extracellular guidance network’ which could help to direct cells to attain energetically optimal locations relative to each other based on the matching of their surface specificities. In numerous experimental situations, where normally present optimal matching of cells is excluded, ‘alternative matching’ based on experiment-specific suboptimal matching could explain many data, notably in experimental development neurobiology (Wassermann, 1978).",J.

N
 contains a monochromatic copy of H. A famous result of Chváatal, Rödl, Szemerédi and Trotter states that there exists a constant c(Δ) such that r(H) ≤ c(Δ)n for every graph H with n vertices and maximum degree Δ. The important open question is to determine the constant c(Δ). The best results, both due to Graham, Rödl and Ruciński, state that there are positive constants c and c′ such that \(2^{c'\Delta } \leqslant c(\Delta ) \leqslant ^{c\Delta \log ^2 \Delta }\). We improve this upper bound, showing that there is a constant c for which c(Δ) ≤ 2cΔlogΔ.The induced Ramsey number r

260,A Complexity Theory of Constructible Functions and Sheaves,"In this paper we introduce constructible analogs of the discrete complexity classes \(\mathbf {VP}\) and \(\mathbf {VNP}\) of sequences of functions. The functions in the new definitions are constructible functions on \(\mathbb {R}^n\) or \(\mathbb {C}^n\). We define a class of sequences of constructible functions that play a role analogous to that of \(\mathbf {VP}\) in the more classical theory. The class analogous to \(\mathbf {VNP}\) is defined using Euler integration. We discuss several examples, develop a theory of completeness, and pose a conjecture analogous to the \(\mathbf {VP}\) versus \(\mathbf {VNP}\) conjecture in the classical case. In the second part of the paper we extend the notions of complexity classes to sequences of constructible sheaves over \(\mathbb {R}^n\) (or its one point compactification). We introduce a class of sequences of simple constructible sheaves, that could be seen as the sheaf-theoretic analog of the Blum–Shub–Smale class \(\mathbf {P}_\mathbb {R}\). We also define a hierarchy of complexity classes of sheaves mirroring the polynomial hierarchy, \(\mathbf {PH}_\mathbb {R}\), in the B–S–S theory. We prove a singly exponential upper bound on the topological complexity of the sheaves in this hierarchy mirroring a similar result in the B–S–S setting. We obtain as a result an algorithm with singly exponential complexity for a sheaf-theoretic variant of the real quantifier elimination problem. We pose the natural sheaf-theoretic analogs of the classical \(\mathbf {P}\) versus \(\mathbf {NP}\) question, and also discuss a connection with Toda’s theorem from discrete complexity theory in the context of constructible sheaves.

It is demonstrated that such type of problems is more general than existing optimization models. In this part, the VP model is proposed first, and the relationship between variable programming and the general constrained nonlinear programming is established. To illustrate its practicality, problems on investment and the low-side-lobe conformal antenna array pattern synthesis to which VP can be appropriately applied are discussed for substantiation. Then, theoretical underpinnings of the VP problems are established. Difficulties in dealing with the VP problems are discussed. With some mild assumptions, the necessary conditions for the unconstrained VP problems with arbitrary and specific activated feasible sets are derived respectively. The necessary conditions for the corresponding constrained VP problems with the mild hypotheses are also examined.

276,Compactness results in extremal graph theory,"Let L be a given family of so called prohibited graphs. Let ex (n, L) denote the maximum number of edges a simple graph of ordern can have without containing subgraphs from L. A typical extremal graph problem is to determine ex (n, L), or at least, find good bounds on it. Results asserting that for a given L there exists a much smaller L*⫅L for which ex (n, L) ≈ ex (n, L*) will be calledcompactness results. The main purpose of this paper is to prove some compactness results for the case when L consists of cycles. One of our main tools will be finding lower bounds on the number of pathsP

278,“The arrival of the fittest”: Toward a theory of biological organization,"The formal structure of evolutionary theory is based upon the dynamics of alleles, individuals and populations. As such, the theory must assume the prior existence of these entities. This existence problem was recognized nearly a century ago, when DeVries (1904,Species and Varieties: Their Origin by Mutation) stated. “Natural selection may explain the survival of the fittest, but it cannot explain the arrival of the fittest.” At the heart of the existence problem is determining how biological organizations arise in ontogeny and in phylogeny.We develop a minimal theory of biological organization based on two abstractions from chemistry. The theory is formulated using λ-calculus, which provides a natural framework capturing (i) the constructive feature of chemistry, that the collision of molecules generates specific new molecules, and (ii) chemistry's diversity of equivalence classes, that many different reactants can yield the same stable product. We employ a well-stirred and constrained stochastic flow reactor to explore the generic behavior of large numbers of applicatively interacting λ-expressions. This constructive dynamical system generates fixed systems of transformation characterized by syntactical and functional invariances.Organizations are recognized and defined by these syntactical and functional regularities. Objects retained within an organization realize and algebraic structure and possess a grammar which is invariant under the interaction between objects. An organization is self-maintaining, and is characterized by (i) boundaries established by the invariances, (ii) strong self-repair capabilities responsible for a robustness to perturbation, and (iii) a center, defined as the smallest kinetically persistent and self-maintaining generator set of the algebra.Imposition of different boundary conditions on the stochastic flow reactor generates different levels of organization, and a diversity of organizations within each level. Level 0 is defined by selfcopying objects or simple ensembles of copying objects. Level 1 denotes a new object class, whose objects are self-maintaining organizations made of Level 0 objects, and Level 2 is defined by self-maintaining metaorganizations composed of Level 1 organizations.These results invite analogy to the history of life, that is, to the progression from self-replication to self-maintaining procaryotic organizations to ultimately yield self-maintaining eucaryotic organizations. In our system self-maintaining organizations arise as a generic consequence of two features of chemistry, without appeal to natural selection. We hold these findings as calling for increased attention to the structural basis of biological order.",Walter Fontana1 & Leo W.

291,Novikov-Morse theory for dynamical systems," The present paper contains an interpretation and generalization of Novikov's theory for Morse type inequalities for closed 1-forms in terms of concepts from Conley's theory for dynamical systems. We introduce the concept of a flow carrying a cocycle \(\alpha\), (generalized) \(\alpha\)-flow for short, where \(\alpha\) is a continuous cocycle in bounded Alexander-Spanier cohomology theory. Gradient-like flows can then be characterized as flows carrying a trivial cocycle. We also define \(\alpha\)-Morse-Smale flows that allow the existence of “cycles” in contrast to the usual Morse-Smale flows. \(\alpha\)-flows without fixed points carry not only a cocycle, but a cohomology class, in the sense of [8], and we shall deduce a vanishing theorem for generalized Novikov numbers in that situation. By passing to a suitable cover of the underlying compact polyhedron adapted to the cocycle \(\alpha\), we construct a so-called \(\pi\)-Morse decomposition for an \(\alpha\)-flow. On this basis, we can use the Conley index to derive generalized Novikov-Morse inequalitites, extending those of M. Farber [12]. In particular, these inequalities include both the classical Morse type inequalities (corresponding to the case when \(\alpha\) is a coboundary) as well as the Novikov type inequalities ( when \(\alpha\) is a nontrivial cocycle).",H.

294,Topological methods in moduli theory,"One of the main themes of this long article is the study of projective varieties which are K(H,1)’s, i.e. classifying spaces BH for some discrete group H. After recalling the basic properties of such classifying spaces, an important class of such varieties is introduced, the one of Bagnera–de Franchis varieties, the quotients of an Abelian variety by the free action of a cyclic group. Moduli spaces of Abelian varieties and of algebraic curves enter into the picture as examples of rational K(H,1)’s, through Teichmüller theory. The main trhust of the paper is to show how in the case of K(H,1)’s the study of moduli spaces and deformation classes can be achieved through by now classical results concerning regularity of classifying maps. The Inoue type varieties of Bauer and Catanese are introduced and studied as a key example, and new results are shown. Motivated from this study, the moduli spaces of algebraic varieties, and especially of algebraic curves with a group of automorphisms of a given topological type are studied in detail, following new results by the author, Michael Lönne and Fabio Perroni. Finally, the action of the absolute Galois group on the moduli spaces of such K(H,1) varieties is studied. In the case of surfaces isogenous to a product, it is shown how this yields a faifhtul action on the set of connected components of the moduli space: for each Galois automorphism of order different from 2 there is an algebraic surface S such that the Galois conjugate surface of S has fundamental group not isomorphic to the one of S.","F.

296,Interpolation Decomposition of Paley-Wiener-Schwartz Space with Application to Signal Theory and Zero Distribution,"In Section 1 we present results on interpolating recovery of entire functions of exponential type having a polynomial asymptotic on the real line. The interpolating formulas obtained extend the Shannon-Kotelnikov sampling formula for bandlimited signals to digitizing of signals having a polynomial time asymptotic and bounded highest frequency. The recovery formulas can be useful to accelerate the convergence of sampling series even in the Shannon-Kotelnikov classical case of time-bounded signals. By blending interpolants we obtain an interpolating formula for recovery of entire functions of exponential type without the restriction of a polynomial asymptotic behavior on a line, i.e., beyond the Paley-Wiener-Schwartz space. In Section 2, by using the interpolating formulas from Section 1, we construct oscillating Chebyshev entire functions of exponential type. They serve as a testing function to study the distribution of the zeros of real entire functions of exponential type. The results on zero distribution of an entire function of exponential type are sharp with respect to the prescribed asymptotic and generalize a theorem by Duffin and Schaeffer. In Section 3 we apply the results on zero distribution of entire functions from Section 2 to conclude one-sided local geometric behavior for real entire functions of exponential type. We give a precise version and extend a result by Hörmander on local geometric behavior of entire functions of exponential type.",D.

298,On the theory of the elasticity of crystals,"The fundamental aspects of the phenomenological theory of elasticity are critically examined and it is shown that the tensor representation of the elastic strains and stresses in the general case should be in the unsymmetrical form. On this basis, the stress-strain relationships are deduced and tabulated for the different crystal classes. The equations determining the velocities of wave-propagation in different directions are also obtained and tabulated. Static deformation problems are then discussed and it is shown that in the particular case of homogeneous strains, the elastic constants group themselves in linear combinations which are equivalent to the elastic modulii of the theory in its familiar form. In wave-propagation, however, the strains and stresses are heterogeneous and hence all the elastic constants are involved and appear in linear combinations which are different and also larger in number than those which figure in the formulæ for homogeneous deformations.

300,On the critical point of the Crocco-Lees mixing theory in the laminar near wake,"The application of the multimoment integral method to the study of the base pressure behind a supersonic vehicle is examined. The primary purpose is to understand the exact nature of the Crocco-Lees critical point, which provides a uniqueness condition in the problem. The analysis is carried out mainly in Poincaré phase space, where the singularities of the differential equations are investigated. Two singular curves are found. The one which is physically meaningful for the near wake flow is located downstream of the rear stagnation point. This singular curve consists of saddle points which yield “wake” solutions, and focal points or saddle-foci. Only those saddle points which yield “wake” solutions correspond to Crocco-Lees critical points. Thus, the integration of the differential equations should be started from a saddle point both for the upstream and the downstream solutions. The current analysis then requires that one deal with only a one-parameter (freestream Mach number) family of solutions, rather than the two-parameter (freestream Mach number and Reynolds number based on thickness of the viscous shear layer at the rear stagnation point) family of solutions obtained in previous works. Finally, this paper clarifies anomalous details of previous numerical investigations carried out for the near wake by Webb, Golik, Vogenitz, and Lees.",D. K.

The lower permeable disk is located at z = −a, while the upper disk is placed at z = a. Both the disks are porous and subjected to uniform injection. The fluid properties such as thermal conductivity vary with temperature. The Cattaneo-Christov thermal expression is implemented along with the Buongiorno nanofluid theory. By operating the similarity functions, the reduced form of the fluid model in terms of ordinary differential equations is obtained and solved by the bvp4c numerical technique. The physical quantities are demonstrated graphically on the velocity and temperature fields. Three-dimensional flow arrangements and two-dimensional contour patterns against several dimensionless variables are also sketched. The numerical values of the local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers for various quantities are presented in tabular set-up.

307,Finding the best resolution for the Kingman–Tajima coalescent: theory and applications,"Many summary statistics currently used in population genetics and in phylogenetics depend only on a rather coarse resolution of the underlying tree (the number of extant lineages, for example). Hence, for computational purposes, working directly on these resolutions appears to be much more efficient. However, this approach seems to have been overlooked in the past. In this paper, we describe six different resolutions of the Kingman–Tajima coalescent together with the corresponding Markov chains, which are essential for inference methods. Two of the resolutions are the well-known \(n\)-coalescent and the lineage death process due to Kingman. Two other resolutions were mentioned by Kingman and Tajima, but never explicitly formalized. Another two resolutions are novel, and complete the picture of a multi-resolution coalescent. For all of them, we provide the forward and backward transition probabilities, the probability of visiting a given state as well as the probability of a given realization of the full Markov chain. We also provide a description of the state-space that highlights the computational gain obtained by working with lower-resolution objects. Finally, we give several examples of summary statistics that depend on a coarser resolution of Kingman’s coalescent, on which simulations are usually based.","Raazesh Sainudiin1, Tanja Stadler2 & Amandine Véber",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-014-0796-5,"

This procedure, which uses dynamic scaling and invariance together with iterated perturbation methods, allows us to evaluate transport coefficients and transport equations for the large-scale (slow) modes. The RNG theory, which does not include any experimentally adjustable parameters, gives the following numerical values for important constants of turbulent flows: Kolmogorov constant for the inertial-range spectrumC

309,Einstein’s quantum theory of the monatomic ideal gas: non-statistical arguments for a new statistics,"In this article, we analyze the third of three papers, in which Einstein presented his quantum theory of the ideal gas of 1924–1925. Although it failed to attract the attention of Einstein’s contemporaries and although also today very few commentators refer to it, we argue for its significance in the context of Einstein’s quantum researches. It contains an attempt to extend and exhaust the characterization of the monatomic ideal gas without appealing to combinatorics. Its ambiguities illustrate Einstein’s confusion with his initial success in extending Bose’s results and in realizing the consequences of what later came to be called Bose–Einstein statistics. We discuss Einstein’s motivation for writing a non-combinatorial paper, partly in response to criticism by his friend Ehrenfest, and we paraphrase its content. Its arguments are based on Einstein’s belief in the complete analogy between the thermodynamics of light quanta and of material particles and invoke considerations of adiabatic transformations as well as of dimensional analysis. These techniques were well known to Einstein from earlier work on Wien’s displacement law, Planck’s radiation theory and the specific heat of solids. We also investigate the possible role of Ehrenfest in the gestation of the theory.",Enric Pérez1 & Tilman Sauer,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-010-0066-x,"Dimensional Analysis,Adiabatic Compression,Light Quantum,Prussian Academy,Adiabatic Transformation"

311,Singular perturbation theory for predicting extravasation of Brownian particles,"Motivated by recent studies on tumor treatments using the drug delivery of nanoparticles, we provide a singular perturbation theory and perform Brownian dynamics simulations to quantify the extravasation rate of Brownian particles in a shear flow over a circular pore with a lumped mass transfer resistance. The analytic theory we present is an expansion in the limit of a vanishing Péclet number (\(P\)), which is the ratio of convective fluxes to diffusive fluxes on the length scale of the pore. We state the concentration of particles near the pore and the extravasation rate (Sherwood number) to \(O(P^{1/2})\). This model improves upon previous studies because the results are valid for all values of the particle mass transfer coefficient across the pore, as modeled by the Damköhler number (\(\kappa \)), which is the ratio of the reaction rate to the diffusive mass transfer rate at the boundary. Previous studies focused on the adsorption-dominated regime (i.e., \(\kappa \rightarrow \infty \)). Specifically, our work provides a theoretical basis and an interpolation-based approximate method for calculating the Sherwood number (a measure of the extravasation rate) for the case of finite resistance [\(\kappa \sim O(1)\)] at small Péclet numbers, which are physiologically important in the extravasation of nanoparticles. We compare the predictions of our theory and an approximate method to Brownian dynamics simulations with reflection–reaction boundary conditions as modeled by \(\kappa \). They are found to agree well at small \(P\) and for the \(\kappa \ll 1\) and \(\kappa \gg 1\) asymptotic limits representing the diffusion-dominated and adsorption-dominated regimes, respectively. Although this model neglects the finite size effects of the particles, it provides an important first step toward understanding the physics of extravasation in the tumor vasculature.","Preyas Shah1, Sean Fitzgibbon2, Vivek Narsimhan2 & …Eric S.

Mackey’s first contribution is a detailed version of the so-called Gelfand criterion for weakly symmetric Gelfand pairs.

315,Finite line-transitive linear spaces: Theory and search strategies,"The paper summarises existing theory and classifications for finite line-transitive linear spaces, develops the theory further, and organises it in a way that enables its effective application. The starting point is a theorem of Camina and the fifth author that identifies three kinds of line-transitive automorphism groups of linear spaces. In two of these cases the group may be imprimitive on points, that is, the group leaves invariant a nontrivial partition of the point set. In the first of these cases the group is almost simple with point-transitive simple socle, and may or may not be point-primitive, while in the second case the group has a non-trivial point-intransitive normal subgroup and hence is definitely point-imprimitive. The theory presented here focuses on point-imprimitive groups. As a non-trivial application a classification is given of the point-imprimitive, line-transitive groups, and the corresponding linear spaces, for which the greatest common divisor gcd(k, v − 1) ≤ 8, where v is the number of points, and k is the line size. Motivation for this classification comes from a result of Weidong Fang and Huiling Li in 1993, that there are only finitely many non-trivial point-imprimitive, line-transitive linear spaces for a given value of gcd(k, v −1). The classification strengthens the classification by Camina and Mischke under the much stronger restriction k ≤ 8: no additional examples arise. The paper provides the backbone for future computer-based classifications of point-imprimitive, line-transitive linear spaces with small parameters. Several suggestions for further investigations are made.","Anton Betten1, Anne Delandtsheer2, Maska Law3, Alice C. Niemeyer3, Cheryl E.

Mathematical model of learning in this paper along with Second selection problem requires to solve the so-called First selection problem where using training data one first selects from wide set of function in Hilbert space an admissible subset of functions that include the desired function and second selects in this admissible subset a good approximation to the desired function. Existence of two selection problems reflects fundamental property of Hilbert space, existence of two different concepts of convergence of functions: weak convergence (that leads to solution of the First selection problem) and strong convergence (that leads to solution of the Second selection problem).

322,"Mathematical model of COVID-19 spread in Turkey and South Africa: theory, methods, and applications","A comprehensive study about the spread of COVID-19 cases in Turkey and South Africa has been presented in this paper. An exhaustive statistical analysis was performed using data collected from Turkey and South Africa within the period of 11 March 2020 to 3 May 2020 and 05 March and 3 of May, respectively. It was observed that in the case of Turkey, a negative Spearman correlation for the number of infected class and a positive Spearman correlation for both the number of deaths and recoveries were obtained. This implied that the daily infections could decrease, while the daily deaths and number of recovered people could increase under current conditions. In the case of South Africa, a negative Spearman correlation for both daily deaths and daily infected people were obtained, indicating that these numbers may decrease if the current conditions are maintained. The utilization of a statistical technique predicted the daily number of infected, recovered, and dead people for each country; and three results were obtained for Turkey, namely an upper boundary, a prediction from current situation and lower boundary. The histograms of the daily number of newly infected, recovered and death showed a sign of lognormal and normal distribution, which is presented using the Bell curving method parameters estimation. A new mathematical model COVID-19 comprised of nine classes was suggested; of which a formula of the reproductive number, well-poseness of the solutions and the stability analysis were presented in detail. The suggested model was further extended to the scope of nonlocal operators for each case; whereby a numerical method was used to provide numerical solutions, and simulations were performed for different non-integer numbers. Additionally, sections devoted to control optimal and others dedicated to compare cases between Turkey and South Africa with the aim to comprehend why there are less numbers of deaths and infected people in South Africa than Turkey were presented in detail.","Abdon Atangana1,2 & Seda İğret Araz",Advances in Difference Equations,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13662-020-03095-w,"Statistical analysis,Bell curve,Prediction,New COVID-19 model,Nonlocal operators,Optimal control,Turkey vs South Africa"

The solution concepts of primal and dual problems are inspired by the nondominated solution concept employed in multiobjective programming problems, since the ordering among the fuzzy numbers introduced in this paper is a partial ordering. In order to consider the differentiation of a fuzzy-valued function, we invoke the Hausdorff metric to define the distance between two fuzzy numbers and the Hukuhara difference to define the difference of two fuzzy numbers. Under these settings, the Wolfe’s dual problem can be formulated by considering the gradients of differentiable fuzzy- valued functions.

In previous work by the second- and third-named authors, the double Hurwitz numbers were conjectured to satisfy a polynomiality structure and to be governed by the topological recursion, analogous to existing results concerning single Hurwitz numbers. In this paper, we resolve these conjectures by a careful analysis of the semi-infinite wedge representation for double Hurwitz numbers. We prove an ELSV-like formula for double Hurwitz numbers, by deforming the Johnson–Pandharipande–Tseng formula for orbifold Hurwitz numbers and using properties of the topological recursion under variation of spectral curves.

339,Test on Stochastic Block Model: Local Smoothing and Extreme Value Theory,"In this paper, to obtain a consistent estimator of the number of communities, the authors present a new sequential testing procedure, based on the locally smoothed adjacency matrix and the extreme value theory. Under the null hypothesis, the test statistic converges to the type I extreme value distribution, and otherwise, it explodes fast and the divergence rate could even reach n in the strong signal case where n is the size of the network, guaranteeing high detection power. This method is simple to use and serves as an alternative approach to the novel one in Lei (2016) using random matrix theory. To detect the change of the community structure, the authors also propose a two-sample test for the stochastic block model with two observed adjacency matrices. Simulation studies justify the theory. The authors apply the proposed method to the political blog data set and find reasonable group structures.","Fan Wu1, Xinbing Kong2 & Chao Xu",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-021-0154-9,"Extreme value distribution,network data,stochastic block model"

At the same time, the molecular dynamics method based on solving the equations of motion for a multiparticle system proved to be directly related to the basic concepts of classical statistical physics, in particular, to the problem of the occurrence of irreversibility. This paper analyzes the dynamic and stochastic properties of molecular dynamics systems connected with the local instability of trajectories and the errors of the numerical integration.

It is also tested in two more cases: one in which the original work fails to predict the optimal outcome, and another one that is quite complex to solve analytically. Lastly, I present two potential extensions of this algorithm: one dynamic, and another one based on quantity competition.ConclusionsThis algorithm opens the door to the extensive inclusion of pricing in agent-based models, but also, it helps to establish a link between the industrial organization literature and the agent-based modeling.","Juan Manuel Sanchez-Cartas

V denote the ith exterior power of the reflection representation V of W. The focus of this paper is on the algebra of W-invariants in

This result was established for e = 0 by Solomon [28] and was proved by Henderson [17] in types A, B, C when e is regular in a Levi subalgebra.The above statement about the W-invariants implies a conjecture of Lehrer–Shoji [19] about the occurrences of Λi
V in \( {H^*}\left( {{\mathcal{B}_e}} \right) \), which was originally stated when e is regular in a Levi subalgebra.

According to this principle it is possible to consider the statistical stabilization not only with respect to the standard real topology on the field of rational numbersQ but also with respect to an arbitrary topology onQ. The case ofp-adic (and more general non-Archimedean) topologies is the most important. Our frequency theory of Probability is a fruitful extension of the frequency theory of R. von Mises[18]. It's well known that the axiomatic theory of Kolmogorov uses the frequency theory as one of the foundations. And a new general frequency theory can be considered as the base for the general axiomatic theory of probability (Kolmogorov's theory is a particular case of this theory which corresponds to the real topology of the statistical stabilization onQ). The situation in the theory of probability becomes similar to that in modern geometry. The Kolmogorov axiomatics (as the Euclidean) is only one of the possibilities, and we have generated a great number of different non-Kolmogorov theories of probability.The applications top-adic quantum mechanics and field theory are considered.",Andrei Khrennikov,Acta Mathematicae Applicatae Sinica,1996,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02009564,"Frequency theory of probability of von Mises,non-Kolmogorovean probability models,

The main difference between the two theories is that the line integral around the ship waterline that occurs in the classical NK boundary-integral flow representation is eliminated in the NM theory. Specifically, the integrand of the waterline integral in the NK theory is \({G\phi_x-\phi G_x}\) , where x is the coordinate along the ship length, \({\phi}\) is the flow potential, and G is the Green function associated with the Kelvin–Michell linear free-surface boundary condition. It is shown that the term \({G \phi_x}\) does not appear in a consistent linear flow model. Furthermore, the term \({\phi G_x}\) can be eliminated using a mathematical transformation, which amounts to an integration by parts.","Francis Noblesse1, Fuxin Huang2 & Chi Yang",Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-012-9568-7,"Boundary-integral method,Free-surface flows,Green’s function,Neumann–Kelvin,Neumann–Michell,Panel method,Ship waves"
358,Information fusion-based approach for studying influence on Twitter using belief theory,"Influence in Twitter has become recently a hot research topic, since this micro-blogging service is widely used to share and disseminate information. Some users are more able than others to influence and persuade peers. Thus, studying most influential users leads to reach a large-scale information diffusion area, something very useful in marketing or political campaigns. In this study, we propose a new approach for multi-level influence assessment on multi-relational networks, such as Twitter. We define a social graph to model the relationships between users as a multiplex graph where users are represented by nodes, and links model the different relations between them (e.g., retweets, mentions, and replies). We explore how relations between nodes in this graph could reveal about the influence degree and propose a generic computational model to assess influence degree of a certain node. This is based on the conjunctive combination rule from the belief functions theory to combine different types of relations. We experiment the proposed method on a large amount of data gathered from Twitter during the European Elections 2014 and deduce top influential candidates. The results show that our model is flexible enough to to consider multiple interactions combination according to social scientists needs or requirements and that the numerical results of the belief theory are accurate. We also evaluate the approach over the CLEF RepLab 2014 data set and show that our approach leads to quite interesting results.","Lobna Azaza1,2, Sergey Kirgizov1, Marinette Savonnet1, Éric Leclercq1, Nicolas Gastineau1 & …Rim Faiz",Computational Social Networks,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40649-016-0030-2,"Social influence,Information fusion,Multi-level fusion,Belief theory,Twitter network"

361,Statistical ranking and combinatorial Hodge theory,"We propose a technique that we call HodgeRank for ranking data that may be incomplete and imbalanced, characteristics common in modern datasets coming from e-commerce and internet applications. We are primarily interested in cardinal data based on scores or ratings though our methods also give specific insights on ordinal data. From raw ranking data, we construct pairwise rankings, represented as edge flows on an appropriate graph. Our statistical ranking method exploits the graph Helmholtzian, which is the graph theoretic analogue of the Helmholtz operator or vector Laplacian, in much the same way the graph Laplacian is an analogue of the Laplace operator or scalar Laplacian. We shall study the graph Helmholtzian using combinatorial Hodge theory, which provides a way to unravel ranking information from edge flows. In particular, we show that every edge flow representing pairwise ranking can be resolved into two orthogonal components, a gradient flow that represents the l
2-optimal global ranking and a divergence-free flow (cyclic) that measures the validity of the global ranking obtained—if this is large, then it indicates that the data does not have a good global ranking. This divergence-free flow can be further decomposed orthogonally into a curl flow (locally cyclic) and a harmonic flow (locally acyclic but globally cyclic); these provides information on whether inconsistency in the ranking data arises locally or globally. When applied to statistical ranking problems, Hodge decomposition sheds light on whether a given dataset may be globally ranked in a meaningful way or if the data is inherently inconsistent and thus could not have any reasonable global ranking; in the latter case it provides information on the nature of the inconsistencies. An obvious advantage over the NP-hardness of Kemeny optimization is that HodgeRank may be easily computed via a linear least squares regression. We also discuss connections with well-known ordinal ranking techniques such as Kemeny optimization and Borda count from social choice theory.","Xiaoye Jiang1, Lek-Heng Lim2, Yuan Yao3 & …Yinyu Ye",Mathematical Programming,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-010-0419-x,"Statistical ranking,Rank aggregation,Combinatorial Hodge theory,Discrete exterior calculus,Combinatorial Laplacian,Hodge Laplacian,Graph Helmholtzian,HodgeRank,Kemeny optimization,Borda count"

The nascent variable precision rough sets (VPRS) model is introduced and compared with the decision tree method ID3 (through a ‘leave n out’ approach), using the same dataset of morphometric measures of European barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) and assessing the accuracy of gender classification based on these measures. The results demonstrate that the VPRS model, allied with the use of a modern method of discretization of data, is comparable with the more traditional non-parametric ID3 decision tree method. We show that, particularly in small samples, the VPRS model can improve classification and to a lesser extent prediction aspects over ID3. Furthermore, through the ‘leave n out’ approach, some indication can be produced of the relative importance of the different morphometric measures used in this problem. In this case we suggest that VPRS has advantages over ID3, as it intelligently uses more of the morphometric data available for the data classification, whilst placing less emphasis on variables with low reliability. In biological terms, the results suggest that the gender of swallows can be determined with reasonable accuracy from morphometric data and highlight the most important variables in this process. We suggest that both analysis techniques are potentially useful for the analysis of a range of different types of biological datasets, and that VPRS in particular has potential for application to a range of biological circumstances.",M.

This nonlinear dependence on λ is allowed both in the leading coefficients and in the potentials. Relative oscillation theory rather than measuring the spectrum of one single problem measures the difference between the spectra of two different problems.

366,Investigation of Cattaneo–Christov Double Diffusions Theory in Bioconvective Slip Flow of Radiated Magneto-Cross-Nanomaterial Over Stretching Cylinder/Plate with Activation Energy,"The present exploration examines the Cattaneo–Christov double diffusions theory in magneto-Cross nanomaterial flow conveying gyrotactic microorganisms over an extending horizontal cylinder/plate under the aspects of velocity slippage, and activation energy with chemically reacting features. The phenomena of thermophoresis, Brownian movement, and thermal radiation are also incorporated. Utilization of the adopted similarity transformations makes it convenient to transform our governing nonlinear higher-order coupled PDEs into ODEs which are further solved numerically by adopting well-known MATLAB function bvp4c. The quantitative outcomes of emerging thermo-physical and geometrical parameters on the associated non-dimensional profiles of interest are anatomized via requisite graphs and numerically erected tabular forms. It is detected that fluid velocity components decline due to upgraded magnetic field and velocity slippage parameter. When thermal time relaxation parameter varies from 0.0 to 0.9, Nusselt number augments about \(22.02\%\) for cylindrical surface and about \(23.61\%\) for plate surface. Likewise, with the same variations in thermal time relaxation parameter Sherwood number increases about \(17.32\%\) for cylindrical surface and about \(18.24\%\) for plate surface. Moreover, comparative exploration of the emerging flow features over a flat plate, and cylindrical surface is reported. It is visualized that flat plate offers less temperature than cylindrical surface when flow occurs. The results would offer primary guidance for many industrial, biological, medical and ecological challenges, for instance, bio-fuel, bio-diesel, ethanol, biological tissues, bio-fertilizers, bio-micro-systems, reproduction, infection, and marine life ecosystems, etc.","Asgar Ali

370,A multiplicative Gauss-Newton minimization algorithm: Theory and application to exponential functions,"Multiplicative calculus (MUC) measures the rate of change of function in terms of ratios, which makes the exponential functions significantly linear in the framework of MUC. Therefore, a generally non-linear optimization problem containing exponential functions becomes a linear problem in MUC. Taking this as motivation, this paper lays mathematical foundation of well-known classical Gauss-Newton minimization (CGNM) algorithm in the framework of MUC. This paper formulates the mathematical derivation of proposed method named as multiplicative Gauss-Newton minimization (MGNM) method along with its convergence properties. The proposed method is generalized for n number of variables, and all its theoretical concepts are authenticated by simulation results. Two case studies have been conducted incorporating multiplicatively-linear and non-linear exponential functions. From simulation results, it has been observed that proposed MGNM method converges for 12972 points, out of 19600 points considered while optimizing multiplicatively-linear exponential function, whereas CGNM and multiplicative Newton minimization methods converge for only 2111 and 9922 points, respectively. Furthermore, for a given set of initial value, the proposed MGNM converges only after 2 iterations as compared to 5 iterations taken by other methods. A similar pattern is observed for multiplicatively-non-linear exponential function. Therefore, it can be said that proposed method converges faster and for large range of initial values as compared to conventional methods.",Anmol Gupta1 & Sanjay Kumar,Applied Mathematics-A Journal of Chinese Universities,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11766-021-3814-6,"multiplicative calculus,multiplicative least square method,multiplicative Newton minimization,multiplicative Gauss-Newton minimization,non-linear exponential functions"

374,The basic theory of infinite time register machines,"Infinite time register machines (ITRMs) are register machines which act on natural numbers and which are allowed to run for arbitrarily many ordinal steps. Successor steps are determined by standard register machine commands. At limit times register contents are defined by appropriate limit operations. In this paper, we examine the ITRMs introduced by the third and fourth author (Koepke and Miller in Logic and Theory of Algorithms LNCS, pp. 306–315, 2008), where a register content at a limit time is set to the lim inf of previous register contents if that limit is finite; otherwise the register is reset to 0. The theory of these machines has several similarities to the infinite time Turing machines (ITTMs) of Hamkins and Lewis. The machines can decide all \({\Pi^1_1}\) sets, yet are strictly weaker than ITTMs. As in the ITTM situation, we introduce a notion of ITRM-clockable ordinals corresponding to the running times of computations. These form a transitive initial segment of the ordinals. Furthermore we prove a Lost Melody theorem: there is a real r such that there is a program P that halts on the empty input for all oracle contents and outputs 1 iff the oracle number is r, but no program can decide for every natural number n whether or not \({n \in r}\) with the empty oracle. In an earlier paper, the third author considered another type of machines where registers were not reset at infinite lim inf’s and he called them infinite time register machines. Because the resetting machines correspond much better to ITTMs we hold that in future the resetting register machines should be called ITRMs.","Merlin Carl1, Tim Fischbach1, Peter Koepke1, Russell Miller2, Miriam Nasfi1 & …Gregor Weckbecker",Archive for Mathematical Logic,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00153-009-0167-x,"Ordinal computability,Hypercomputation,Infinitary computation,Register machine"

To every system \({\mathfrak{A}}\) , we put into a correspondence a family \({\mathcal{F}_{\mathfrak{A}}}\) of continuous mappings of a suitable non-Archimedean metric space and show that the system is completely transitive if and only if the family \({\mathcal{F}_{\mathfrak{A}}}\) is ergodic w.r.t. the Haar measure; then we find easy-to-verify conditions the system must satisfy to be completely transitive. The theory can be applied to analyse behaviour of straight-line computer programs (in particular, pseudo-random number generators that are used in cryptography and simulations) since basic CPU instructions (both numerical and logical) can be considered as continuous mappings of a (non-Archimedean) metric space \({\mathbb{Z}_{2}}\) of 2-adic integers.",Vladimir Anashin,Mathematics in Computer Science,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11786-012-0132-7,"Automaton,Discrete system,Ergodicity,

The theory may be interpreted substantially as a “hit theory” involving the concepts of “sensitive volume” or “target area”. The variability of the sensitivity of the organism to the radiation and its capacity of recovery between single hits is taken into account. It is shown that in a continuous irradiation of a biological aggregate in which the effect of each single hit cannot be observed, recovery and variation of sensitivity are formally equivalent to each other so that a discrimination between these two phenomena is possible only by discontinuous irradiation or by using different radiation intensities. Methods for the calculation of the “number of hits” and for the determination of the kinetics of the processes from “survival curves” or similar experimental data are given. The relation between the recovery and the Bunsen-Roscoe law is discussed.

385,Analyzing facial expressions with fuzzy quantification theory II: indefinite generalized eigenvalue problem,"Machine understanding of human interactive behaviour is a challenging task. In this paper, facial expressions are used to induce emotions on a group of subjects and sense fuzzy human interactive behaviour. When fuzzy quantification theory II is used to analyze the emotions induced by facial expressions, the relationship between induced emotions and facial features is linearized by solving a dense generalized eigenvalue problem. As the matrices are ill-conditioned and indefinite when small data set of facial expressions is used, the theory describing the possible solutions of the eigenvalue problem gets complicated. This paper proposes a perturbation of the eigenvalue problem by using the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse that keeps the error bounds of the solution within the error bounds of the widely used GUPTRI algorithm. Experimental results show that GUPTRI algorithm fails in some cases where the number of samples is very small while the solution provided by proposed approach never fails and is more accurate.","Luis A.

The question may seem to be utterly absurd, possibly because we are empirically so used to the existence of two opposite sexes that we take this fact for granted. Genetics shows us the usefulness of sexual reproduction compared with asexual reproduction. The former provides for the possibility of producing a number of new combinations of genes and thus a number of different varieties of individuals of a species. But why only two sexes? It is logically conceivable that biological structures may exist such that their multiplication may require the fusion not of two but of three, four or any other numberk of cells. Such situations are quite easily imagined for unicellulars, such as bacteria or paramecia. But with some greater effort of our imagination we may well imagine such a situation to occur also in higher organisms and men. Why does this not occur?

400,On handle theory for Morse–Bott critical manifolds,"In this article, we use Conley Index Theory to set up a framework to associate topological-dynamical invariants to a Morse–Bott flow in a neighborhood of a critical manifold. Isolating blocks N for a critical manifold S are characterized in terms of conditions on the ranks of its homology Conley index. The necessity of these conditions follows from the generalized Morse–Bott inequalities for isolating blocks. Morse–Bott semi-graphs turn out to be a useful combinatorial device to record these topological conditions. One goal is to verify that these conditions when imposed on an n-abstract Morse–Bott semi-graph are sufficient for its realization. This is attained by introducing Morse–Bott handle surgeries in order to construct isolating blocks for critical manifolds in dimensions 2 and 3, and for a large class in higher dimensions.

402,"Independence and port oracles for matroids, with an application to computational learning theory","Given a matroidM with distinguished elemente, aport oracie with respect toe reports whether or not a given subset contains a circuit that containse. The first main result of this paper is an algorithm for computing ane-based ear decomposition (that is, an ear decomposition every circuit of which contains elemente) of a matroid using only a polynomial number of elementary operations and port oracle calls. In the case thatM is binary, the incidence vectors of the circuits in the ear decomposition form a matrix representation forM. Thus, this algorithm solves a problem in computational learning theory; it learns the class ofbinary matroid port (BMP) functions with membership queries in polynomial time. In this context, the algorithm generalizes results of Angluin, Hellerstein, and Karpinski [1], and Raghavan and Schach [17], who showed that certain subclasses of the BMP functions are learnable in polynomial time using membership queries. The second main result of this paper is an algorithm for testing independence of a given input set of the matroidM. This algorithm, which uses the ear decomposition algorithm as a subroutine, uses only a polynomial number of elementary operations and port oracle calls.

This allows the theorems of density functional theory to relate non-relativistic quantum mechanics to a classical statistical mechanical derivation of polymer self-consistent field theory for ring polymers in a 4 dimensional thermal-space. One dynamic postulate is added to two static postulates which allows for a description of quantum physics from a 5 dimensional thermal-space-time ensemble perspective.

The main result is Theorem 1 in which an explicit form of the Fourier expansion is presented which generalizes the well-known formula of Selberg and Chowla. From this, in particular, there follows a proof of the analytic continuation and the functional equations for this Eisentein series which is independent of the work of Langlands. The arithmetic coefficients in the Fourier expansion which generalize the number-theoretic functions σs(n)=∑d¦n,d>od5 make it possible to relate the Eisenstein series considered to the problem of finding the asymptotics as Χ → ∞ of the sum ∑n⩽Χτ3(n)τ3(n+κ), where τ3(n) is the number of solutions of the equation d1d2d3=n in natural numbers.

The “island model” bias is treated for the case of two islands and a single axon tracing, resulting in a pair of linear difference equations with two indices. The reflexive bias is extended to multiple-axon tracing by an approximate method resulting in a modification of the random net recursion formula.

412,"Einstein and the Early Theory of Superconductivity, 1919–1922","Einstein's early thoughts about superconductivity are discussed as a case study of how theoretical physics reacts to experimental findings that are incompatible with established theoretical notions. One such notion that is discussed is the model of electric conductivity implied by Drude's electron theory of metals, and the derivation of the Wiedemann-Franz law within this framework. After summarizing the experimental knowledge on superconductivity around 1920, the topic is then discussed both on a phenomenological level in terms of implications of Maxwell's equations for the case of infinite conductivity, and on a microscopic level in terms of suggested models for superconductive charge transport. Analyzing Einstein's manuscripts and correspondence as well as his own 1922 paper on the subject, it is shown that Einstein had a sustained interest in superconductivity and was well informed about the phenomenon. It is argued that his appointment as special professor in Leiden in 1920 was motivated to a considerable extent by his perception as a leading theoretician of quantum theory and condensed matter physics and the hope that he would contribute to the theoretical direction of the experiments done at Kamerlingh Onnes' cryogenic laboratory. Einstein tried to live up to these expectations by proposing at least three experiments on the phenomenon, one of which was carried out twice in Leiden. Compared to other theoretical proposals at the time, the prominent role of quantum concepts was characteristic of Einstein's understanding of the phenomenon. The paper concludes with comments on Einstein's epistemological reflections on the problem.",Tilman Sauer,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-006-0122-8,"Early Theory,Liquid Helium Temperature,Electron Theory,Perfect Conductivity,Conduction Chain"
413,A theory of recursive dimension for ordered sets,"The classical theorem of R. P. Dilworth asserts that a partially ordered set of width n can be partitioned into n chains. Dilworth's theorem plays a central role in the dimension theory of partially ordered sets since chain partitions can be used to provide embeddings of partially ordered sets in the Cartesian product of chains. In particular, the dimension of a partially-ordered set never exceeds its width. In this paper, we consider analogous problems in the setting of recursive combinatorics where it is required that the partially ordered set and any associated partition or embedding be described by recursive functions. We establish several theorems providing upper bounds on the recursive dimension of a partially ordered set in terms of its width. The proofs are highly combinatorial in nature and involve a detailed analysis of a 2-person game in which one person builds a partially ordered set one point at a time and the other builds the partition or embedding.","Henry A.

414,On the modular representation theory of the partition algebra,"We determine the decomposition numbers of the partition algebra when the characteristic of the ground field is zero or larger than the degree of the partition algebra. This will allow us to determine exactly for which values of the parameter the partition algebras are semisimple over an arbitrary field. Furthermore, we show that the blocks of the partition algebra over an arbitrary field categorify weight spaces of an action of the quantum groups \(\mathcal {U}_q(\widehat{\mathfrak {sl}_p})\) and \(\mathcal {U}_q(\mathfrak {sl}_\infty )\) on an analogue of the Fock space. In particular, we recover the block structure which was recently determined by Bowman et al. In order to do so, we use induction and restriction functors as well as analogues of Jucys–Murphy elements. The description of decomposition numbers will be in terms of combinatorics of partitions but can also be given a Lie theoretic interpretation in terms of a Weyl group of type \(A\): a simple module \(L(\mu )\) is a composition factor of a cell module \(\Delta (\lambda )\) if and only if \(\lambda \) and \(\mu \) differ by the action of a transposition.",Armin Shalile,Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10801-014-0580-z,"Partition algebra,Diagram algebras,Decomposition numbers,Blocks,Jucys–Murphy elements"
415,Morse Theory for S-balanced Configurations in the Newtonian n-body Problem,"For the Newtonian (gravitational) n-body problem in the Euclidean d-dimensional space, the simplest possible solutions are provided by those rigid motions (homographic solutions) in which each body moves along a Keplerian orbit and the configuration of the n-body is a (constant up to rotations and scalings) central configuration. For \(d\le 3\), the only possible homographic motions are those given by central configurations. For \(d \ge 4\) instead, new possibilities arise due to the higher complexity of the orthogonal group \(\mathrm {O}(d)\), as observed by Albouy and Chenciner (Invent Math 131(1):151–184, 1998). For instance, in \(\mathbb {R}^4\) it is possible to rotate in two mutually orthogonal planes with different angular velocities. This produces a new balance between gravitational forces and centrifugal forces providing new periodic and quasi-periodic motions. So, for \(d\ge 4\) there is a wider class of S -balanced configurations (containing the central ones) providing simple solutions of the n-body problem, which can be characterized as well through critical point theory. In this paper, we first provide a lower bound on the number of balanced (non-central) configurations in \(\mathbb {R}^d\), for arbitrary \(d\ge 4\), and establish a version of the \(45^\circ \)-theorem for balanced configurations, thus answering some of the questions raised in Moeckel (Central configurations, 2014). Also, a careful study of the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Poincaré polynomial of the collision free configuration sphere will enable us to derive some rather unexpected qualitative consequences on the count of S-balanced configurations. In the last part of the paper, we focus on the case \(d=4\) and provide a lower bound on the number of periodic and quasi-periodic motions of the gravitational n-body problem which improves a previous celebrated result of McCord (Ergodic Theory Dyn Syst 16:1059–1070, 1996).","Luca Asselle

420,Structure theory of flip graphs with applications to Weak Symmetry Breaking,"This paper is devoted to advancing the theoretical understanding of the iterated immediate snapshot (IIS) complexity of the Weak Symmetry Breaking task (WSB). Our rather unexpected main theorem states that there exist infinitely many values of n, such that WSB for n processes is solvable by a certain explicitly constructed 3-round IIS protocol. In particular, the minimal number of rounds, which an IIS protocol needs in order to solve the WSB task, does not go to infinity, when the number of processes goes to infinity. Our methods can also be used to generate such values of n. We phrase our proofs in combinatorial language, while avoiding using topology. To this end, we study a certain class of graphs, which we call flip graphs. These graphs encode adjacency structure in certain subcomplexes of iterated standard chromatic subdivisions of a simplex. While keeping the geometric background in mind for an additional intuition, we develop the structure theory of matchings in flip graphs in a purely combinatorial way. Our bound for the IIS complexity is then a corollary of this general theory. As an afterthought of our result, we suggest to change the overall paradigm. Specifically, we think, that the bounds on the IIS complexity of solving WSB for n processes should be formulated in terms of the size of the solutions of the associated Diophantine equation, rather than in terms of the value n itself.",Dmitry N.

The Lie theoretic origin of known van der Pol and Lahiri-type arithmetic identities is thus unveiled, and similar new ones are derived in a systematic way. These identities relate divisor functions, Ramanujan’s τ-function and functions defined by the Fourier coefficients of other cusp forms and involve hybrid coefficients, drawn from Lie theory and number theory, given explicitly by formulae combining the arithmetic Clebsch–Gordan coefficients and the Bernoulli numbers. A few side results, interesting in their own right, such as Leibniz-type rules satisfied by the Rankin–Cohen brackets, are also obtained.","Amine M.

In spite of early interest, in recent years relatively little research using this method has been published, perhaps because the JPG method is rarely explained in its totality and when it is, the descriptions are often inconsistent or unclear. Although it is now embedded in several software programs and its use may be more widespread, it is no better understood and after processing there is a marked lack of consistency in how the results are interpreted. This paper provides a historical background for the development of the JPG and a discussion of its conceptual or theoretical origins, followed by a “worked example” of the mathematics of the JPG. In combination with the results for two further cases, the paper identifies some important interpretative limits in the method and uses the examples to explain its potential use in design analysis.

423,New Polynomial Invariants of Knotoids and the Theory of Polar Knots,"We introduce new polynomial invariants for both planar knotoids and spherical knotoids. To introduce these invariants, we first introduce what we call polar knots, and give the fundamentals of their theory. Polar knots are knots with a finite number of points that do not allow strands slide over or under them. We focus on polar knots with two poles, which we call 2-polar knots. We show that knotoids are in one-to-one correspondence with a subset of 2-polar knots. We obtain this correspondence through what we call the right traffic closure (or left traffic closure) of knotoids, which relates every knotoid with a 2-polar knot. We use Kauffman bracketology to define isotopy invariants for 2-polar knots and hence for knotoids. Our polynomial invariant of planar knotoids and planar 2-polar knots, denoted by \(X_{p}\), involves eight variables, and it can distinguish between a knotoid and its reverse unlike other polynomials previously defined using Kauffman bracket. Our invariant of spherical knotoids and spherical 2-polar knots, denoted by \( X_{s}\), involves four variables. We also define some geometric invariants of 2-polar knots and we conjecture that they can be detected by the \(X_{p}\) and \(X_{s}\) polynomials.","Khaled Bataineh

An important extension of classical two-dimensional topological field theories is provided by open-closed two-dimensional topological field theories. In this paper we extend open-closed two-dimensional topological field theories to nonorientable surfaces. We call them Klein topological field theories (KTFT).We prove that KTFTs bijectively correspond to (in general noncommutative) algebras with certain additional structures, called structure algebras. The semisimple structure algebras are classified. Starting from an arbitrary finite group, we construct a structure algebra and prove that it is semisimple.We define an analog of Hurwitz numbers for real algebraic curves and prove that they are correlators of a KTFT. The structure algebra of this KTFT is the structure algebra of a symmetric group.","A. Alexeevski1 & S.

436,"Efficient numerical methods in non-uniform
sampling theory
","
We present a new ``second generation""
reconstruction algorithm for irregular sampling, i\@.e\@. for the
problem of
recovering a band-limited function from its non-uniformly sampled
values. The efficient new method is a combination of the adaptive
weights
method which was developed by the two first named authors
and the method of conjugate gradients for the solution of positive
definite linear systems.
The choice of ""adaptive weights"" can be seen as a simple but very
efficient
method of preconditioning. Further substantial acceleration is
achieved by utilizing the Toeplitz-type structure of the system
matrix. This new algorithm can handle problems of much larger
dimension and condition number than have been
accessible so far. Furthermore, if some gaps between samples are
large, then the algorithm can still be used as a very efficient
extrapolation method across the gaps.

It is of theoretical interest in revealing lifting mechanisms. It is therefore, interesting to generalize the classical lifting line theory to cases more general than just the free space problem. In this article, we present the Prandtl lifting line theory for wing-in-ground effect (WIG) near a free surface. While, the fundamental methodology being similar to the classical lifting line theory, it turns out that the difficulty lies in finding the three-dimensional Green’s function for the system of horseshoe vortices operating over the deformable free surface. Linear free surface boundary conditions are applied to deal with the two-dimensional lifting problem solved by the singularity distribution method and the three-dimensional correction found by placing a system of horseshoe vortices on the wing. This approach was validated against published data. Excellent agreement is found among results obtained from this study, experiments and numerical simulations. Extensive numerical examples are carried out to show the features of lift coefficients in the vicinity of a free surface. As expected, the free surface can be represented by a rigid wall for the case of high velocity. Finally, the free surface effect on WIG is discussed.","Z. Zong1, H. Liang1 & L.

It is shown that data transport in the system is determined by file volumes and the systems topology and expressed by the “topological transport factor”. The quality of the system design can be measured by its transport factor and the relation of this to the topological transport factor.On this basis future development of algorithms for minimal data transport and of standard lists for file contents and typical transport factors are expected.

The central quantity of the classical theory is Hamilton’s function, which determines canonical equations, a corresponding flow, and a Liouville equation for a probability density. We extend this theory in two respects: (1) The same structure is defined for arbitrary observables. Thus, we have all of the above entities generated not only by Hamilton’s function but also by every observable. (2) We introduce for each observable a phase space function representing the classical action. This is a redundant quantity in a classical context but indispensable for the transition to QT. The basic equations of the resulting theory take a “quantum-like” form, which allows for a simple derivation of QT by means of a projection to configuration space reported previously [Quantum Stud Math Found 5:219–227, 2018]. We obtain the most important relations of QT, namely the form of operators, Schrödinger’s equation, eigenvalue equations, commutation relations, expectation values, and Born’s rule. Implications for the interpretation of QT are discussed, as well as an alternative projection method allowing for a derivation of spin.","U. Klein

The motion on every perturbed torus is quasiperiodic with the same frequencies. In this sense the frequencies of invariant tori of the unperturbed system are preserved. Recently, it has been found that the Kolmogorov nondegeneracy condition can be weakened so as to guarantee the preservation of only some subset of frequencies. Such partial preservation of frequencies can also be defined for lower dimensional invariant tori, whose dimension is less than the number of degrees of freedom. We consider a more general problem of partial preservation not only of the frequencies of invariant tori but also of their Floquet exponents (the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix of the variational equation along the torus). The results are formulated for Hamiltonian, reversible, and dissipative systems (with a complete proof for the reversible case).",M. B.

466,A theory of regularity structures,"We introduce a new notion of “regularity structure” that provides an algebraic framework allowing to describe functions and/or distributions via a kind of “jet” or local Taylor expansion around each point. The main novel idea is to replace the classical polynomial model which is suitable for describing smooth functions by arbitrary models that are purpose-built for the problem at hand. In particular, this allows to describe the local behaviour not only of functions but also of large classes of distributions. We then build a calculus allowing to perform the various operations (multiplication, composition with smooth functions, integration against singular kernels) necessary to formulate fixed point equations for a very large class of semilinear PDEs driven by some very singular (typically random) input. This allows, for the first time, to give a mathematically rigorous meaning to many interesting stochastic PDEs arising in physics. The theory comes with convergence results that allow to interpret the solutions obtained in this way as limits of classical solutions to regularised problems, possibly modified by the addition of diverging counterterms. These counterterms arise naturally through the action of a “renormalisation group” which is defined canonically in terms of the regularity structure associated to the given class of PDEs. Our theory also allows to easily recover many existing results on singular stochastic PDEs (KPZ equation, stochastic quantisation equations, Burgers-type equations) and to understand them as particular instances of a unified framework. One surprising insight is that in all of these instances local solutions are actually “smooth” in the sense that they can be approximated locally to arbitrarily high degree as linear combinations of a fixed family of random functions/distributions that play the role of “polynomials” in the theory. As an example of a novel application, we solve the long-standing problem of building a natural Markov process that is symmetric with respect to the (finite volume) measure describing the \(\Phi ^4_3\) Euclidean quantum field theory. It is natural to conjecture that the Markov process built in this way describes the Glauber dynamic of \(3\)-dimensional ferromagnets near their critical temperature.",M.

468,Geometric Invariant Theory in a Model-Independent Analysis of Spontaneous Symmetry and Supersymmetry Breaking,"Functions which are covariant or invariant under the transformations of a reductive linear algebraic group can be advantageously expressed in terms of functions defined in the orbit space of the group, i.e. as functions of a finite set of basic invariant polynomials. This fact and the tools of geometric invariant theory can be exploited in many physical contexts where the study of covariant or invariant functions is important, for instance in the determination of patterns of spontaneous symmetry and/or supersymmetry breaking in possibly supersymmetric quantum field theories of elementary particles, in the analysis of phase spaces and structural phase transitions in solid state physics (Landau's theory), in covariant bifurcation theory, in crystal field theory and in most areas of solid state theory where use is made of symmetry adapted functions.

470,A theory of Fisher's reproductive value,"The formal Darwinism project aims to provide a mathematically rigorous basis for optimisation thinking in relation to natural selection. This paper deals with the situation in which individuals in a population belong to classes, such as sexes, or size and/or age classes. Fisher introduced the concept of reproductive value into biology to help analyse evolutionary processes of populations divided into classes. Here a rigorously defined and very general structure justifies, and shows the unity of concept behind, Fisher's uses of reproductive value as measuring the significance for evolutionary processes of (i) an individual and (ii) a class; (iii) recursively, as calculable for a parent as a sum of its shares in the reproductive values of its offspring; and (iv) as an evolutionary maximand under natural selection. The maximand is the same for all parental classes, and is a weighted sum of offspring numbers, which implies that a tradeoff in one aspect of the phenotype can legitimately be studied separately from other aspects. The Price equation, measure theory, Markov theory and positive operators contribute to the framework, which is then applied to a number of examples, including a new and fully rigorous version of Fisher's sex ratio argument. Classes may be discrete (e.g. sex), continuous (e.g. weight at fledging) or multidimensional with discrete and continuous components (e.g. sex and weight at fledging and adult tarsus length).",Alan Grafen,Journal of Mathematical Biology,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-006-0376-4,"Reproductive Value,R.A.

471,Perturbations of elliptic operators on high codimension subsets and the extension theory on an indefinite metric space,The spectral aspect of the problem of perturbations supported on thin sets of codimension θ≥2m in ℝn is considered for elliptic operators of order m. The problem of realization of such perturbations is formulated as a problem of self-adjoint extension of a linear symmetric relation in a space with indefinite metric. It is shown how to construct such a relation for a given elliptic operator and a family of distributions. Its functional model is obtained in terms of Q-functions. Self-adjoint extensions and their resolvents are described. The theory developed is applied to quantum models of point interactions in high dimensions and high moments. Bibliography: 35 titles.,Yu.

We prove that if X and Y are compact, connected triangulated manifolds without boundary, of the same dimension, then given \(\epsilon > 0\), there is an n-valued map \(\psi \) homotopic to \(\phi \) within Hausdorff distance \(\epsilon \) of \(\phi \) such that \(\psi \) has finitely many roots at a. We conjecture that if X and Y are q-manifolds without boundary, \(q \ne 2\), then there is an n-valued map homotopic to \(\phi \) that has \(N(\phi : a)\) roots at a.

480,"Problems, Models and Complexity. Part I: Theory","The meaning of the term ‘problem’ in operations research (OR) deviates from the understanding in the theoretical computer sciences: While an OR problem is often conceived to be stated or represented by model formulations, a computer-science problem can be viewed as a mapping from encoded instances to solutions. Such a computer-science problem turns out to be rather similar to an OR model formulation. This ambiguity may cause difficulties if the computer-science theory of computational complexity is applied in the OR context. In OR, a specific model formulation is commonly used in the analysis of the underlying problem and the results obtained for this model are simply lifted to the problem level. But this may lead to erroneous results, if the model used is not appropriate for such an analysis of the problem.To resolve this issue, we first suggest a new precise formal definition of the term problem which is identified with an equivalence class of models describing it. Afterwards, a new definition is suggested for the size of a model which depends on the assumed encoding scheme. Only models which exhibit a minimal size with respect to a ‘reasonable’ encoding scheme finally turn out to be suitable for the model-based complexity analysis of an OR problem. Therefore, the appropriate choice (or if necessary the construction) of a suitable representative of an OR problem becomes an important theoretical aspect of the modelling process.","W.

481,A note on the mathematical theory of the effect of nervous stress on coronary thrombosis,"The “classical” view of formation of blood clots is that the disintegration of platelets releases thrombokinase which activates prothrombin into thrombin. The latter combining with fibrinogen produces fibrin, the substance of the clot. There is, however, ample evidence of hormonal and other biochemical factors as playing a role in the process of clotting. Through the necessity of a breakdown of platelets has been challenged, yet theirpresence is considered as necessary for clotting. Thefirst part of this paper is based on the assumption that either a breakdown or even an injury of a platelet produces thrombokinase. An injury is likely to occur due to collisions between platelets, between platelets and erythrocytes or between platelets and leukocytes. A probability is ascribed to the production of thrombokinase by a collision. Thus not every collision is effective. The frequency of those collisions is calculated according to classical physics. Inasmuch as mental stress usually causes vasoconstriction and therefore an increase of concentration of the formed elements of blood, the frequency of collisions and therefore the production of small amounts of thrombokinase increases with stress. If thrombokinase formed by the collision remains preserved and therefore accumulates in the blood, we arrive at an expression which gives us the necessary total duration of stress to produce thrombosis. According to that equation, even in the absence of stress, any individual if he lives long enough should eventually develop a thrombosis. If, however the thrombokinase is destroyed, then it is necessary that during a sufficiently short time enough effective collisions occur to increase the amount of thrombokinase to a danger level. With this picture we find only theprobability of a formation of a thrombus as a function of the intensity of stress and its duration. The probability remains finite event for zero stress, showing that even individuals who are always relaxed may develop thrombi.In the second part of the paper an outline of a biochemical approach is given. Inasmuch as we know very little about the biochemical mechanism involved, it is simply assumed that during a stress of intensityS and duration Δ there is a probability of a thrombosis occurring. Then by applying the theory of probabilities, an expression is derived giving the probability of occurrence of a thrombus after a given number of stress incidences. The expressions are different from those obtained from the first approach but lead basically to the same results. A comparison of both or of their combination, with available data may give indications as to which of the factors plays a preponderant part.",N.

We review the physical derivation of this deep periodic orbit theory in terms of the phase space formulation with a view toward the Hamiltonian dynamical systems. The Maslov phase appearing in the trace formula is clarified by Meinrenken as Conley–Zehnder index for periodic orbits of Hamiltonian systems. We also survey and compare various versions of Maslov indices to establish this fact. A refinement and improvement to Conley–Zehnder’s index theory in which we will recall all essential ingredients is the Maslov-type index theory for symplectic paths developed by Long and his collaborators. It would shed new light on the computations and understandings of the semiclassical trace formula.

In this paper, a nonlinear theory is developed for coalescence, where two characteristics change from hyperbolic to elliptic via collision. Firstly, a linear theory develops the structure of colliding characteristics involving the topological sign of characteristics and multiple Jordan chains, and secondly, a nonlinear modulation theory is developed for transitions. The nonlinear theory shows that coalescing characteristics morph the Whitham equations into an asymptotically valid geometric form of the two-way Boussinesq equation, that is, coalescing characteristics generate dispersion, nonlinearity and complex wave fields. For illustration, the theory is applied to coalescing characteristics associated with the modulation of two-phase travelling wave solutions of coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations, highlighting how collisions can be identified and the relevant dispersive dynamics constructed.","Thomas J.

The work used cumulative prospect theory, currently the most influential model for decision under uncertainty, to optimize urban bus network. To achieve the research objective, the work developed the theoretical framework of urban bus network optimization, including optimization principle, optimization objectives and constraints. Furthermore, optimization objectives could comprehensively reflect expectations of passengers and bus companies from the dimension of time, space and value. It is more scientific and reasonable compared with only one stakeholder or dimension alone in the previous studies. In addition, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) was used to determine the positive and negative ideal alternative. The correlations between the optimization alternatives and the ideal alternatives were estimated by grey relational analysis simultaneously. The cumulative prospect theory (CPT) was used to determine the best alternative by comparing comprehensive prospect value of every alternative, accurately describing decision-making behavior compared with expected utility theory in actual life. Finally, Case of Xi’an showed that the method can better adjust the bus network, and the optimization solution is more reasonable to meet the actual needs.","Xiaowei Li1,2,3, Wei Wang2,3, Chengcheng Xu2,3, Zhibin Li2,3 & …Baojie Wang2,",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-015-2049-0,"Bus network,cumulative prospect theory,optimization,traffic engineering"

504,"Life, information theory, and topology","The information content of an organism determines to a large extent its ability to perform the basic vital functions: selection of food, breaking up of the food molecules into appropriate parts, selection of those parts, and their assimilation. The information content needed is very large and requires a sufficiently large complexity of the organism. The information content of an organism is largely determined by the information content of the constituent organic molecules. The information content of the latter is in its turn determined by the number of physically distinguishable atoms or radicals of which the molecule is composed. The different arrangements of atoms in a molecule are represented by the structural formula, which is basically a graph. It is shown that the topology of this graph also determines to a large extent the information content. Different points of a graph may be physically indistinguishable; in general, however, they are different in regard to their topological properties. A study of the relations between the topological properties of graphs and their information content is suggested, and several theorems are demonstrated. A relation between topology and living processes is thus found also on the molecular level.",N.

513,Application of Queueing Theory in Dispensation of Resources and Optimization in Teleconsultation,"The common queueing problem in hospital has always focused on domestic and foreign specialist. Various improved models of queueing theory are widely used to solve problems. Most of the existing research results focus on improving the efficiency of hospital outpatient service and operation on bed arrangement, and rarely involve the emerging phenomenon of long-distance consultation queueing. With the development of medical information, more patients will request for remote consultation in primary hospitals to obtain experts resources of bigger hospitals in the most convenient way. In cities where some telemedicine development is at the forefront, there has been a phenomenon of queueing for remote consultation, however, the special queueing phenomenon that patients do not appear in hospitals cannot be explained by existing queueing model. Hence a more suitable queueing model is needed. We deduced the following, according to the parameters, the queueing system of remote consultation is simulated. It is found that the queueing of internal medicine department is congested. By analyzing the number of consultation rooms and the influence of experts of internal medicine department on queueing length and queueing time, it is concluded that experts of internal medicine department need not change too much. This study enriches the theoretical optimization queueing problem in hospital management and provides an analysis and decision making method for perfecting the theory of hospital queueing and improving the efficiency of medical services.","Saviour Worlanyo Akuamoah

(A)
We cast aside the traditional quaternion theory and build up the theory of functions of a complex variable under Dirac-Pauli representation. Thus the multivariate and multidimensional problems become rather simple problems.


(B)
We simplify the Navier-Stokes equation of incompressible viscous fluid dynamics and the equations group of isentropic aerodynamics by theory of functions of a complex variable under Dirac-Pauli representation. And the above-equations, as central problems of fluid dynamics, are classified as the nonlinear equation with only one complex unknown function.

In this work, returns of securities are assumed to be uncertain variables, which cannot be estimated by randomness or fuzziness. The model in the uncertain environment is formulated as a nonlinear programming model based on uncertainty theory. Also, some other criteria like short-and long-term returns, dividends, number of assets in the portfolio, and the maximum and minimum allowable capital invested in stocks of any company are considered. Since there is no efficient solution methodology to solve the proposed model, assuming the returns as some special uncertain variables, the original portfolio selection model is transformed into an equivalent deterministic model, which can be solved by any state-of-the-art solution methodology.ResultsThe feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by a numerical example extracted from Bombay Stock Exchange, India. Returns are considered in the form of trapezoidal uncertain variables. A genetic algorithm is used for simulation.ConclusionsThe efficiency of the portfolio is evaluated by looking for risk contraction on one hand and expected return and skewness augmentation on the other hand. An empirical application has served to illustrate the computational tractability of the approach and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","Rupak Bhattacharyya1, Amitava Chatterjee2 & Samarjit Kar",Journal of Uncertainty Analysis and Applications,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2195-5468-1-16,"Uncertainty modeling,Mean-entropy-skewness portfolio selection model,Uncertain variables,Trapezoidal uncertain variable,Genetic algorithm"
517,Further results concerning the refined theory of anisotropic laminated composite plates,"A simple refined discrete-layer theory of anisotropic laminated composite plates is substantiated. The theory is based on the assumption of a piecewise linear variation of the in-plane displacement components and of the constancy of the transverse displacement throughout the thickness of the laminate. This plate model incorporates transverse shear deformation, dynamic and thermal effects as well as the geometrical non-linearities and fulfills the continuity conditions for the displacement components and transverse shear stresses at the interfaces between laminae. As it is shown in the paper, the refinement implying the fulfillment of continuity conditions is not accompanied by an increase of the number of independent unknown functions, as implied in the standard first order transverse shear deformation theory. It is also shown that the within the framework of the linearized static counterpart of the theory, several theorems analogous to the ones in the 3-D elasticity theory could be established. These concern the energetic theorems, Betti's reciprocity theorem, the uniqueness theorem for the solutions of boundary-value problems of elastic composite plates, etc. Finally, comparative remarks on the present and standard first order transverse shear deformation theories are made and pertinent conclusions about its usefulness and further developments are outlined.",R.

532,"On the abstract theory of additive and multiplicative
Schwarz algorithms
","
  In recent years, it has been shown that many modern iterative algorithms
  (multigrid schemes, multilevel preconditioners, domain decomposition
   methods etc.)
  for solving problems resulting from the discretization
  of PDEs can be
  interpreted as additive (Jacobi-like) or multiplicative
  (Gauss-Seidel-like) subspace correction methods. The key to their
  analysis is the study of certain metric properties of the underlying
  splitting of the discretization space \(V\) into a sum of subspaces \(V_j\)
  and the splitting of the variational problem on \(V\) into auxiliary problems on
  these subspaces.

In this paper, we propose a modification of the abstract convergence
  theory of the additive and multiplicative Schwarz methods, that
  makes the relation to traditional iteration methods more explicit.
  The analysis of the additive and multiplicative Schwarz iterations
  can be carried out in almost the same spirit as in the
  traditional block-matrix
  situation, making convergence proofs of multilevel and domain decomposition
  methods clearer, or, at least, more classical.

  In addition, we present a
  new bound for the convergence rate of the appropriately scaled
  multiplicative Schwarz method directly in terms
  of the condition number of the corresponding additive
  Schwarz operator.

533,The combinatorics of discrete time-trees: theory and open problems,"A time-tree is a rooted phylogenetic tree such that all internal nodes are equipped with absolute divergence dates and all leaf nodes are equipped with sampling dates. Such time-trees have become a central object of study in phylogenetics but little is known about the parameter space of such objects. Here we introduce and study a hierarchy of discrete approximations of the space of time-trees from the graph-theoretic and algorithmic point of view. One of the basic and widely used phylogenetic graphs, the \(\mathrm {NNI}\) graph, is the roughest approximation and bottom level of our hierarchy. More refined approximations discretize the relative timing of evolutionary divergence and sampling dates. We study basic graph-theoretic questions for these graphs, including the size of neighborhoods, diameter upper and lower bounds, and the problem of finding shortest paths. We settle many of these questions by extending the concept of graph grammars introduced by Sleator, Tarjan, and Thurston to our graphs. Although time values greatly increase the number of possible trees, we show that 1-neighborhood sizes remain linear, allowing for efficient local exploration and construction of these graphs. We also obtain upper bounds on the r-neighborhood sizes of these graphs, including a smaller bound than was previously known for \(\mathrm {NNI}\). Our results open up a number of possible directions for theoretical investigation of graph-theoretic and algorithmic properties of the time-tree graphs. We discuss the directions that are most valuable for phylogenetic applications and give a list of prominent open problems for those applications. In particular, we conjecture that the split theorem applies to shortest paths in time-tree graphs, a property not shared in the general \(\mathrm {NNI}\) case.","Alex Gavryushkin

534,Strip theory for underwater vehicles in water of finite depth,"This paper addresses the need to know the unsteady forces and moments on an underwater vehicle in finite-depth water, at small enough submergences for it to be influenced by sea waves. The forces are those due to the waves themselves, as well as the radiation forces due to unsteady vehicle motions. Knowledge of these forces and the mass distribution of the vehicle allow solution of the equations of motion at a single-frequency. Since the theory is linear, any incident wave field can be decomposed into the sum of many individual single-frequency sinusoidal waves. The motions due to each frequency component can then be added together to obtain the total predicted vehicle motions. The wave forces are due to the undisturbed sea wave plus those due to the diffracted wave necessary to satisfy boundary conditions on the vehicle. The long-used strip theory for ships, with the inviscid-flow approximation, is modified for finite depth and inclusion of lift forces on the vehicle fins. The two-dimensional solutions for the forces on each strip are found by a different method than is commonly used for strip theory. This form of the theory is easier to deal with and requires much less computing time than a fully three-dimensional approach. Experiments are conducted and their results are compared with the theory. Excellent agreement is found between the theoretical and experimental wave forces, including the diffracted wave. It is shown that inclusion of the forces on the fins not only improves the theoretical wave forces, but also brings the results of theory for the radiation forces and moments due to vehicle motions much closer to the experimental values that the theory without inclusion of fin lift forces.",Jerome H.

541,An Exceptional Set in the Ergodic Theory of Expanding Maps on Manifolds,"Under a general hypothesis an expanding map T of a Riemannian manifold M is known to preserve a measure equivalent to the Liouville measure on that manifold. As a consequence of this and Birkhoff’s pointwise ergodic theorem, the orbits of almost all points on the manifold are asymptotically distributed with regard to this Liouville measure. Let T be Lipschitz of class τ for some τ in (0,1], let Ω(x) denote the forward orbit closure of x and for a positive real number δ and let E(x0, δ) denote the set of points x in M such that the distance from x0 to Ω is at least δ. Let dim A denote the Hausdorff dimension of the set A. In this paper we prove a result which implies that there is a constant C(T) > 0 such that 
					 \(\dim E(x_0,\delta) \ge \dim M - \frac{C(T)}{\vert\!\log \delta \vert} \)
					if τ = 1 and
					\(\dim E(x_0,\delta) \ge \dim M - \frac{C(T)}{\log \vert \log \delta \vert}\)	if τ < 1. This gives a quantitative converse to the above asymptotic distribution phenomenon.

Various conflict redistribution rules have been examined with respect to their influence on the results. Furthermore, the implications of the surrogate model type, i.e. using combined, single or a hybrid of both, have been studied. The suggested algorithms were applied to several well-known global optimization test problems. The results indicate that the used approach leads for all problems to a thorough exploration of the variable domain, i.e. the vicinities of global optima could be detected, and that the global minima could in most cases be approximated with high accuracy.",Juliane Müller1 & Robert Piché,Journal of Global Optimization,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-010-9620-y,"Global optimization,Mixture surrogate models,Dempster-Shafer theory,Response surface"

It is confirmed that for the present bending model, the new solution strategy possesses more general applicability and superior flexibility in the selection of collocation points. Finally, the effects of different boundary conditions, applied loads, and geometrical shapes on the bending properties of MEE nanoplates are evaluated by using the developed method.

548,Hybrid Galerkin boundary elements: theory and implementation,"
Summary. In this paper we present a new quadrature method for computing Galerkin stiffness matrices arising from the discretisation of 3D boundary integral equations using continuous piecewise linear boundary elements. This rule takes as points some subset of the nodes of the mesh and can be used for computing non-singular Galerkin integrals corresponding to pairs of basis functions with non-intersecting supports. When this new rule is combined with standard methods for the singular Galerkin integrals we obtain a “hybrid” Galerkin method which has the same stability and asymptotic convergence properties as the true Galerkin method but a complexity more akin to that of a collocation or Nyström method. The method can be applied to a wide range of singular and weakly-singular first- and second-kind equations, including many for which the classical Nyström method is not even defined. The results apply to equations on piecewise-smooth Lipschitz boundaries, and to non-quasiuniform (but shape-regular) meshes. A by-product of the analysis is a stability theory for quadrature rules of precision 1 and 2 based on arbitrary points in the plane. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new method realises the performance expected from the theory.","I.G. Graham1, W. Hackbusch2 & S.A.

Using Bohr’s correspondence principle and Einstein’s quantum theory of radiation along with advanced techniques from classical mechanics, Van Vleck showed that quantum formulae for emission, absorption, and dispersion of radiation merge with their classical counterparts in the limit of high quantum numbers. For modern readers Van Vleck’s paper is much easier to follow than the famous paper by Kramers and Heisenberg on dispersion theory, which covers similar terrain and is widely credited to have led directly to Heisenberg’s Umdeutung paper. This makes Van Vleck’s paper extremely valuable for the reconstruction of the genesis of matrix mechanics. It also makes it tempting to ask why Van Vleck did not take the next step and develop matrix mechanics himself.","Anthony Duncan1 & Michel Janssen2,",Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-007-0010-x,"Quantum Theory,Physical Review,Correspondence Principle,Light Quantum,Dispersion Theory"

562,Instability theory of shock wave in a channel,"The instability theory of shock wave was extended from the case with an infinite front[1] to the case of a channel with a rectangular cross section. First, the mathematical formulation of the problem was given which included a system of disturbed equations and three kinds of boundary conditions. Then, the general solutions of the equations upstream and downstream were given and each contained five constants to be determined. Thirdly, under one boundary condition and one assumption, it was proved that all of the disturbances in front of the shock front and one of the two acoustic disturbances behind the shock front should be zero. The boundary condition was that all of the disturbed physical quantities should approach to zero at infinity. The assumption was that only the unstable shock wave was concerned here. So it was reasonable to assume ω=iγ, γ was the instability growth rate and was a positive real number. Another kind of boundary conditions was that the normal disturbed velocities should be zero at the solid wall of the channel, and it led to the result that the wave number of disturbances could only be a set of discrete values. Finally, a total of five conservation equations across the disturbed shock front was the third kind of boundary conditions which was used to determine the remained four undertermined constants downstream and an undetermined constant representing the amplitude of disturbed shock front. Then a dispersion relation was derived. The results show that a positive real γ does exist, so the assumption made above is self-consistent, and there are two modes, instead of one, for unstable shock. One mode corresponds to γ=−W·k (W<0). It is a newly discovered mode and represents an absolute instability of shock. The instability criterion derived from another mode is nearly the same as the one obtained in [2, 3], in addition, its growth rate is newly derived in this paper, and on this basis, it is further pointed out that at j2(ϱ/ϱP)H=1+2M, the shock wave is most unstable, i.e. its nondimensional growth rate Γ=∞If ω is assumed to be a complex number with Im(ω)≥0 instead of being assumed a pure imaginary number at the beginning, it can be proved in Section V that there are still two models for the instability criteria, besides, the roots ω of the dispersion equation are still imaginary.",Xu Fu1 & Chen Le-shan,Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,1993,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02456653,"shock wave,shock wave in a channel,instability theory of shock wave,shock wave stability"

564,"Nevanlinna theory, diophantine approximation, and numerical analysis","This article treats the problem of the approximation of an analytic function f on the unit disk by rational functions having integral coefficients, with the goodness of each approximation being judged in terms of the maximum of the absolute values of the coefficients of the rational function. This relates to the more usual approximation by a rational function in that it could imply how many decimal places are needed when applying a particularly good rational function approximation having non-integrad coefficients.It is shown how to obtain “good” approximations of this type and it is also shown how under certain circumstances “very good” bounds are not possible. As in diophantine approximation this means that many merely “good” approximations do exist, which may be the preferable case. The existence or nonexistence of “very good” approximations is closely related to the diophantine approximation of the first nonzero power series coefficient of at z=0.

566,Homotopy Theory in Digital Topology,"Digital topology is part of the ongoing endeavor to understand and analyze digitized images. With a view to supporting this endeavor, many notions from algebraic topology have been introduced into the setting of digital topology. But some of the most basic notions from homotopy theory remain largely absent from the digital topology literature. We embark on a development of homotopy theory in digital topology, and define such fundamental notions as function spaces, path spaces, and cofibrations in this setting. We establish digital analogues of basic homotopy-theoretic properties such as the homotopy extension property for cofibrations, and the homotopy lifting property for certain evaluation maps that correspond to path fibrations in the topological setting. We indicate that some depth may be achieved by using these homotopy-theoretic notions to give a preliminary treatment of Lusternik–Schnirelmann category in the digital topology setting. This topic provides a connection between digital topology and critical points of functions on manifolds, as well as other topics from topological dynamics.","Gregory Lupton

577,Direct transcription solution of optimal control problems with higher order state constraints: theory vs practice,"
Theoretical results from optimal control theory and numerical analysis play an important role in understanding and numerically solving optimal control problems with higher order state inequality constraints. However, the application of these theoretical results to numerical practice can sometimes be misleading. In this paper we examine a specific example which arose in the development of an industrial grade optimal control package that uses a direct transcription approach. This example illustrates several aspects of direct transcription codes that require a reinterpretation of the numerical and analytical theory.

But it is straightforward to transform his famous `acoustic analogy' to make vorticity rather than Reynolds stress the ultimate `source' of sound in homentropic flows. `Vortex sound' theory becomes especially useful in applications involving acoustically compact flow-structure interactions, where it actually emerges as an extension of Kelvin's theory of `vortex impulse', a notion that Lighthill regarded as important enough to be given special treatment in undergraduate lectures on fluid mechanics. The `impulse source' can be recast in a form more suited for numerical or analytical evaluation, and is closely related to the `compact Green's function'. Convergence difficulties encountered in the casual application of the acoustic analogy to non-compact flow-structure interactions are resolved in a natural manner by the methods of vortex sound theory. New illustrations of these methods are given in this paper by consideration of the unsteady development of lift by a starting airfoil, of the production of sound by a `vortex whistle', and of the infrasound generated when a high-speed train enters the tunnel.",M.S.

Let K be a finite simplicial complex of dimension three or less endowed with the piecewise Euclidean geometry given by declaring edges to have unit length, and satisfying the property that every 2-simplex is a face of at most two 3-simplices in K. Our main result is that if |K| is nonpositively curved [in the sense of CAT(0)] then K simplicially collapses to a point. The main tool used in the proof is Forman’s discrete Morse theory, a combinatorial analog of the classical smooth theory developed in the 1920s.

The asymptotical relatedness condition is such that dependence on u is allowed even as \(|\xi |\rightarrow +\infty \). Unlike in previous work f is allowed to satisfy a more general growth condition, which permits a coupling between the x and u variables. Due to the generality of the asymptotical relatedness condition this coupling induces a subtle restriction on the regularity required of the various functions in the growth condition, and we study these restrictions in this paper. In addition, here we do not obtain the full spectrum of Hölder continuity for the minimizer, but rather a restricted range of Hölder exponents that depend on the initial data.",Christopher S.

The strain-displacement relations (kinematic equations) are calculated by the displacement fields of the twisted micro-beam. The strain gradient theory (SGT) is used to implement the size dependent effect at microscale. Finally, using an energy method and Hamilton’s principle, the governing equations of motion for the twisted micro-beam are derived. Natural frequencies and the wave propagation speed of the twisted micro-beam are calculated with an analytical method. Also, the natural frequency, the phase speed, the cut-off frequency, and the wave number of the twisted micro-beam are obtained by considering three material length scale parameters, the rate of twist angle, the thickness, the length of twisted micro-beam, and the elastic medium. The results of this work indicate that the phase speed in a twisted micro-beam increases with an increase in the rate of twist angle. Moreover, the wave number is inversely related with the thickness of micro-beam. Meanwhile, it is directly related to the wave propagation frequency. Increasing the rate of twist angle causes the increase in the natural frequency especially with higher thickness. The effect of the twist angle rate on the group velocity is observed at a lower wave propagation frequency.","M. Mohammadimehr1, M. J. Farahi1 & S.

In contrast to this point of view, moreover widely shared in the literature, this article argues that it is possible to find a connection between the formulation of the correspondence principle and the assessment that led Bohr to abandon the search for a Planck-type theory. In fact, a thorough examination of Bohr’s works shows that the birth of this principle coincided with the depletion of a research program whose origins may date back to Bohr’s stay at the Rutherford’s laboratory (summer 1912). Finally, this article argues that original program of research was abandoned when it became clear that Planck’s quantum hypothesis for the harmonic oscillator was not an adequate support for the theoretical architecture of atomic physics; namely, there was evidence enough to justify a most drastic conclusion, according to Bohr: “I do not think that a theory of the Planck type can be made logical consistent”.",Sandro Petruccioli,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-014-0137-5,"Quantum Theory,Harmonic Oscillator,Atomic System,Correspondence Principle,Philosophical Magazine"
595,Rank and duality in representation theory,"There is both theoretical and numerical evidence that the set of irreducible representations of a reductive group over local or finite fields is naturally partitioned into families according to analytic properties of representations. Examples of such properties are the rate of decay at infinity of “matrix coefficients” in the local field setting, and the order of magnitude of “character ratios” in the finite field situation.In these notes we describe known results, new results, and conjectures in the theory of “size” of representations of classical groups over finite fields (when correctly stated, most of them hold also in the local field setting), whose ultimate goal is to classify the above mentioned families of representations and accordingly to estimate the relevant analytic properties of each family.Specifically, we treat two main issues: the first is the introduction of a rigorous definition of a notion of size for representations of classical groups, and the second issue is a method to construct and obtain information on each family of representation of a given size.In particular, we propose several compatible notions of size that we call U-rank, tensor rank and asymptotic rank, and we develop a method called eta correspondence to construct the families of representation of each given rank.Rank suggests a new way to organize the representations of classical groups over finite and local fields—a way in which the building blocks are the “smallest” representations. This is in contrast to Harish-Chandra’s philosophy of cusp forms that is the main organizational principle since the 60s, and in it the building blocks are the cuspidal representations which are, in some sense, the “largest”. The philosophy of cusp forms is well adapted to establishing the Plancherel formula for reductive groups over local fields, and led to Lusztig’s classification of the irreducible representations of such groups over finite fields. However, the understanding of certain analytic properties, such as those mentioned above, seems to require a different approach.",Shamgar Gurevich1 & Roger Howe,Japanese Journal of Mathematics,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11537-020-1728-3,"harmonic analysis,character ratios,rank,oscillator representation,dual pairs,eta correspondence"

601,Representation theory in chiral conformal field theory: from fields to observables,"This article develops new techniques for understanding the relationship between the three different mathematical formulations of two-dimensional chiral conformal field theory: conformal nets (axiomatizing local observables), vertex operator algebras (axiomatizing fields), and Segal CFTs. It builds upon previous work (Tener in Adv Math 349:488–563, 2019), which introduced a geometric interpolation procedure for constructing conformal nets from VOAs via Segal CFT, simultaneously relating all three frameworks. In this article, we extend this construction to study the relationship between the representation theory of conformal nets and the representation theory of vertex operator algebras. We define a correspondence between representations in the two contexts, and show how to construct representations of conformal nets from VOAs. We also show that this correspondence is rich enough to relate the respective ‘fusion product’ theories for conformal nets and VOAs, by constructing local intertwiners (in the sense of conformal nets) from intertwining operators (in the sense of VOAs). We use these techniques to show that all WZW conformal nets can be constructed using our geometric interpolation procedure.",James E.

602,Symmetric bilinear forms over finite fields with applications to coding theory,"Let \(q\) be an odd prime power and let \(X(m,q)\) be the set of symmetric bilinear forms on an \(m\)-dimensional vector space over \(\mathbb {F}_q\). The partition of \(X(m,q)\) induced by the action of the general linear group gives rise to a commutative translation association scheme. We give explicit expressions for the eigenvalues of this scheme in terms of linear combinations of generalized Krawtchouk polynomials. We then study \(d\)-codes in this scheme, namely subsets \(Y\) of \(X(m,q)\) with the property that, for all distinct \(A,B\in Y\), the rank of \(A-B\) is at least \(d\). We prove bounds on the size of a \(d\)-code and show that, under certain conditions, the inner distribution of a \(d\)-code is determined by its parameters. Constructions of \(d\)-codes are given, which are optimal among the \(d\)-codes that are subgroups of \(X(m,q)\). Finally, with every subset \(Y\) of \(X(m,q)\), we associate two classical codes over \(\mathbb {F}_q\) and show that their Hamming distance enumerators can be expressed in terms of the inner distribution of \(Y\). As an example, we obtain the distance enumerators of certain cyclic codes, for which many special cases have been previously obtained using long ad hoc calculations.",Kai-Uwe Schmidt,Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10801-015-0595-0,"Association scheme,Symmetric bilinear form,Quadratic form,Code,Weight enumerator"

In contrast to the existing methods such as Singular-Spectrum Analysis and Recurrence Quantification Analysis the proposed method can distinguish the difference between a temporal outlier and a change in non-linear dynamics. Moreover, applying the proposed method to the real data, we found the indirect relation between the change in non-linear dynamics and some outer force (the actress in TV commercial or attack by competitors).","Tetsuji Hidaka1,2 & Yasunori Okabe",Japan Journal of Industrial and Applied Mathematics,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13160-011-0055-8,"Change point detection,Non-linear dynamics,Time series,Self-organizing maps,The theory of KM2O-Langevin equations"

In particular, problems are considered where signals from several neurons must pass through a single one, thus resulting in a “bottleneck” in the flow of information, an abstract model of the corresponding bottleneck from the retina to the optic nerve. The first part of the paper deals with a construction of a McCulloch-Pitts net in which the redundancy in the messages originating in two neurons is utilized so that the messages can be sent over a single neuron with little loss of information. In the second part, messages from a set of neurons are “pumped” into two channel neurons. The optimum connection scheme is computed for this case, i.e, one resulting in a minimum loss of information.

There are some experimental indications that it is not, with differences conjectured to be due to wave lift and drag associated with the divergent gravity-wave system in the surface flow field generated by the boat. Maruo (Schiffstechnik 72 (1967) 57) presents an integral equation for flat low-aspect-ratio planing hulls.

610,Transmission Eigenvalues and the Riemann Zeta Function in Scattering Theory for Automorphic Forms on Fuchsian Groups of Type I,"We introduce the concept of transmission eigenvalues in scattering theory for automorphic forms on fundamental domains generated by discrete groups acting on the hyperbolic upper half complex plane. In particular, we consider Fuchsian groups of type I. Transmission eigenvalues are related to those eigen-parameters for which one can send an incident wave that produces no scattering. The notion of transmission eigenvalues, or non-scattering energies, is well studied in the Euclidean geometry, where in some cases these eigenvalues appear as zeros of the scattering matrix. As opposed to scattering poles, in hyperbolic geometry such a connection between zeros of the scattering matrix and non-scattering energies is not studied, and the goal of this paper is to do just this for particular arithmetic groups. For such groups, using existing deep results from analytic number theory, we reveal that the zeros of the scattering matrix, consequently non-scattering energies, are directly expressed in terms of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Weyl’s asymptotic laws are provided for the eigenvalues in those cases along with estimates on their location in the complex plane.",Fioralba Cakoni1 & Sagun Chanillo,"Acta Mathematica Sinica, English Series",2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10114-019-8128-8,"Transmission eigenvalues,Fuchsian groups,Riemann zeta function,scattering theory"

614,Morse Theory and Evasiveness," is a non-contractible subcomplex of a simplex S then M is evasive. In this paper we make this result quantitative, and show that the more non-contractible M is, the more evasive M is. Recall that M is evasive if for every decision tree algorithm A there is a face  of S that requires that one examines all vertices of S (in the order determined by A) before one is able to determine whether or not  lies in M. We call such faces evaders of A. M is nonevasive if and only if there is a decision tree algorithm A with no evaders. A main result of this paper is that for any decision tree algorithm A, there is a CW complex M', homotopy equivalent to M, such that the number of cells in M' is precisely  where the constant is +1 if the emptyset  is not an evader of A, and -1 otherwise. In particular, this implies that if there is a decision tree algorithm with no evaders, then M is homotopy equivalent to a point. This is the theorem in [12].In fact, in [12] it was shown that if M is non-collapsible then M is evasive, and we also present a quantitative version of this more precise statement.The proofs use the discrete Morse theory developed in [6].",Robin Forman,Combinatorica,2000,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004930070003,"AMS Subject Classification (1991) Classes:  05C99, 55U05"

The main feature of the principle of induction used (due to Givant and Tarski) is that it incorporates Foundation. On the analogy of what is done in Arithmetic, in the axiomatic system selected the transitive closure of the membership relation is taken as a primitive notion, so as to permit an immediate adaptation of the theory to cases of restricted induction (in particular primitive recursive induction). At the end of the paper several different forms of induction, which play an important role in the development of the theory, are compared.

622,Learning theory: stability is sufficient for generalization and necessary and sufficient for consistency of empirical risk minimization,"
Solutions of learning problems by Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) – and almost-ERM when the minimizer does not exist – need to be consistent, so that they may be predictive. They also need to be well-posed in the sense of being stable, so that they might be used robustly. We propose a statistical form of stability, defined as leave-one-out (LOO) stability. We prove that for bounded loss classes LOO stability is (a) sufficient for generalization, that is convergence in probability of the empirical error to the expected error, for any algorithm satisfying it and, (b) necessary and sufficient for consistency of ERM. Thus LOO stability is a weak form of stability that represents a sufficient condition for generalization for symmetric learning algorithms while subsuming the classical conditions for consistency of ERM. In particular, we conclude that a certain form of well-posedness and consistency are equivalent for ERM.

623,Modelling the growth of solid tumours and incorporating a method for their classification using nonlinear elasticity theory,"Medically, tumours are classified into two important classes — benign and malignant. Generally speaking, the two classes display different behaviour with regard to their rate and manner of growth and subsequent possible spread. In this paper, we formulate a new approach to tumour growth using results and techniques from nonlinear elasticity theory. A mathematical model is given for the growth of a solid tumour using membrane and thick-shell theory. A central feature of the model is the characterisation of the material composition of the model through the use of a strain-energy function, thus permitting a mathematical description of the degree of differentiation of the tumour explicitly in the model. Conditions are given in terms of the strain-energy function for the processes of invasion and metastasis occurring in a tumour, being interpreted as the bifurcation modes of the spherical shell which the tumour is essentially modelled as. Our results are compared with actual experimental results and with the general behaviour shown by benign and malignant tumours. Finally, we use these results in conjunction with aspects of surface morphogenesis of tumours (in particular, the Gaussian and mean curvatures of the surface of a solid tumour) in an attempt to produce a mathematical formulation and description of the important medical processes of staging and grading cancers. We hope that this approach may form the basis of a practical application.",M. A. J. Chaplain1 nAff2 & B. D.

The first produce their food themselves from some external source of energy, which in general may be an energy of any kind. The others use other organismic sets as the source of their food and energy. On earth we know only one kind of generalgeneral autotrophic organismic sets, namely, the autotrophic plants which use solar radiation as their source of energy and for production of their own food. It is shown why autotrophic animals do not exist on earth except as microorganisms like, e.g.,Euglena. A rigorous proof of the previously derived theorem that in an organismic set of ordern>1 no element can be completely specialized is given. It requires the introduction of new postulates.

Multivalued maps like orbit, limit set, prolongations etc., are an useful tool in Dynamical Systems theory. In this work we develop a calculus for multivalued maps associated with a dynamical system. Then we give general definitions of stability and attraction of a compact set with respect to a multivalued map. On the basis of our calculus, we obtain several characterizations of stability and attraction, which generalise well known classical theorems.

643,"New horizons in sphere-packing theory, part II: lattice-based derivative-free optimization via global surrogates","Derivative-free algorithms are frequently required for the optimization of nonsmooth scalar functions in n dimensions resulting, for example, from physical experiments or from the statistical averaging of numerical simulations of chaotic systems such as turbulent flows. The core idea of all efficient algorithms for problems of this type is to keep function evaluations far apart until convergence is approached. Generalized pattern search (GPS) algorithms, a modern class of methods particularly well suited to such problems, accomplish this by coordinating the search with an underlying grid which is refined, and coarsened, as appropriate. One of the most efficient subclasses of GPS algorithms, known as the surrogate management framework (SMF; see Booker et al. in Struct Multidiscip Optim 17:1–13, 1999), alternates between an exploratory search over an interpolating function which summarizes the trends exhibited by existing function evaluations, and an exhaustive poll which checks the function on neighboring points to confirm or confute the local optimality of any given candidate minimum point (CMP) on the underlying grid. The original SMF algorithm implemented a GPS step on an underlying Cartesian grid, augmented with a Kriging-based surrogate search. Rather than using the n-dimensional Cartesian grid (the typical choice), the present work introduces for this purpose the use of lattices derived from n-dimensional sphere packings. As reviewed and analyzed extensively in Part I of this series (see Belitz, PhD dissertation, University of California, San Diego, 2011, Chap. 2), such lattices are significantly more uniform and have many more nearest neighbors than their Cartesian counterparts. Both of these facts make them far better suited for coordinating GPS algorithms, as demonstrated here in a variety of numerical tests.",Paul Belitz1 & Thomas Bewley,Journal of Global Optimization,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-012-9866-7,"N-dimensional sphere-packing theory,Generalized pattern search,Derivative-free optimization,Global optimization,Surrogate-based methods,Kriging interpolation"

In this paper, we are concerned with the analysis of private sector proposals and the selection of the private sector partner to whom to award the contract. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been addressed within a game theory framework. To fill this gap, we model this decision problem as a static non-cooperative game of complete information and propose a new ordinal game theory algorithm for finding an optimal generalized Nash equilibrium. The proposed algorithm determines a single ranking of proposals or bidders that takes account of multiple performance criteria and reflects both the public sector and the private sector perspectives, and can handle any number of private sector players and any number of contractual terms. An illustrative scenario is provided to guide the reader through the workings of the proposed ordinal game theory algorithm. The proposed ordinal game theory-based analysis framework can be used by the private sector to analyse any set of potential proposals most likely to be submitted by bidders and to assist with the choice of bidding strategies, and by the public sector player to analyse any set of potential proposals most likely to be submitted under any set of contractual terms and to assist with the choice of a realistic set of contractual terms and their performance measures.","Jamal Ouenniche1, Aristotelis Boukouras2 & Mohammad Rajabi",Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-015-0844-3,"Ordinal game theory,Non-cooperative games,Public–private partnership,Generalized Nash equilibria"

660,A Model for Carrier-Mediated Biological Signal Transduction Based on Equilibrium Ligand Binding Theory,"Different variants of a mathematical model for carrier-mediated signal transduction are introduced with focus on the odor dose–electrophysiological response curve of insect olfaction. The latter offers a unique opportunity to observe experimentally the effect of an alteration in the carrier molecule composition on the signal molecule-dependent response curve. Our work highlights the role of involved carrier molecules, which have largely been ignored in mathematical models for response curves in the past. The resulting model explains how the involvement of more than one carrier molecule in signal molecule transport can cause dose–response curves as observed in experiments, without the need of more than one receptor per neuron. In particular, the model has the following features: (1) An extended sensitivity range of neuronal response is implemented by a system consisting of only one receptor but several carrier molecules with different affinities for the signal molecule. (2) Given that the sensitivity range is extended by the involvement of different carrier molecules, the model implies that a strong difference in the expression levels of the carrier molecules is absolutely essential for wide range responses. (3) Complex changes in dose–response curves which can be observed when the expression levels of carrier molecules are altered experimentally can be explained by interactions between different carrier molecules. The principles we demonstrate here for electrophysiological responses can also be applied to any other carrier-mediated biological signal transduction process. The presented concept provides a framework for modeling and statistical analysis of signal transduction processes if sufficient information on the underlying biology is available.","Johannes W. R.

663,Dynamic structure theory: A structural approach to social and biological systems,"The relationships that define the structure of a given ecosystem, social system, or even a physiological function can only exist if certain parameters are confined to a certain range of values. As the values change and exceed this given range the relationships are forced to change, and so produce a new pattern of relationships. The concept of a dynamic structure captures this potential for structural change in relation to a set of parameters. The precise definition of structure and allowable transformation constitutes the definition of a category. The total range of parameters associated with all the relevant structures provides a parameter space which is assumed to be a manifold. Maps with extra structure from the manifold to the category define dynamic structures. The domain of differential dynamic systems is the manifold, and a flow or movement across the manifold is associated with a series of structural transformations in the category. In some cases a structure outruns its parameter range, to be faced with an obstruction—an absence of possible transformations. Ways of studying such “obstructions” are considered along with the related problem of extending a dynamic structure beyond a previously given set of parameters. The cost or resistance of transformations is also studied. The concepts of dynamic structures are illustrated by the structural change of food webs and they are used in a necessarily qualitative fashion to study dominance structures of social orders and finally to speculate on the qualitative nature of evolutionary change of functional aspects of organisms.",A.

668,New results in Sridhar filtering theory: The discrete case,"A nonlinear time-varying adaptive filter is introduced, and its derivation using optimal control concepts is given in detail. The filter, which is called the discrete Pontryagin filter, is basically an extension to Sridhar filtering theory. The proposed approach can easily replace the conventional methods of autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models in their many applications. Instead of using a large number of time-invariant parameters to describe the signal or the time series, a single time-varying function is enough. This function is estimated using optimization techniques. Many features are gained using this approach, such as simpler and compact filter equations and better overall accuracy. The statistical properties of the filter are given, and it is shown that the signal estimate will converge in thepth mean to the true value.",A. S. Abutaleb1 & M.

669,A Universal Algebraic Set Theory Built on Mereology with Applications,"Category theory is often treated as an algebraic foundation for mathematics, and the widely known algebraization of ZF set theory in terms of this discipline is referenced as “categorical set theory” or “set theory for category theory”. The method of algebraization used in this theory has not been formulated in terms of universal algebra so far. In current paper, a universal algebraic method, i.e. one formulated in terms of universal algebra, is presented and used for algebraization of a ground mereological system described as “quantitative” (QMS) and of the standard set theories built upon it. The QMS is algebraized by using abelian generalized groups (AGGs) generalizing both abelian groups and Boolean algebras. To algebraize set theory, the AGG are enriched with operators to produce extensional algebras (EA) of Tarskian “Boolean algebras with operators” type. EAs explicate the intuition of set theory’ universes (of discourse). The axiomatic set theory presented in this paper, named extension theory, previously went through an intuitive phase of development during its use by the author in computer science projects, where it served as the basis for development of a foundational data science framework and an extensional model of natural languages also outlined here.",Ioachim Drugus,Logica Universalis,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11787-022-00295-8,"Algebraic set theory,Generalized Boolean algebra,Boolean algebra with operators"

In this paper, a Fuchsian group Γ is a group of linear isometries of the Minkowski space such that \({\mathbb{H}^d/\Gamma}\) is a compact manifold. We introduce Fuchsian convex bodies, which are closed convex sets in Minkowski space, globally invariant for the action of a Fuchsian group. A volume can be associated to each Fuchsian convex body, and, if the group is fixed, Minkowski addition behaves well. Then Fuchsian convex bodies can be studied in the same manner as convex bodies of Euclidean space in the classical Brunn–Minkowski theory. For example, support functions can be defined, as functions on a compact hyperbolic manifold instead of the sphere. The main result is the convexity of the associated volume (it is log concave in the classical setting). This implies analogs of Alexandrov–Fenchel and Brunn–Minkowski inequalities. Here the inequalities are reversed.",François Fillastre,Geometric and Functional Analysis,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00039-012-0205-4,"Convex Body,Minkowski Space,Support Function,Fundamental Domain,Hyperbolic Manifold"
672,Multicriterion Aerodynamic Shape Design Optimization and Inverse Problems Using Control Theory and Nash Games,"
Multicriterion design is gaining importance in aeronautics in order to cope with new needs of society. In the literature, contributions to single discipline and/or single-point design optimization abound. The goal of this paper is to introduce a new approach combining the adjoint method with a formulation derived from game theory for multipoint aerodynamic design problems. Transonic flows around lifting airfoils are analyzed via Euler computations. Airfoil shapes are optimized according to various aerodynamic criteria. The notion of player is introduced. In a competitive Nash game, each player attempts to optimize its own criterion through a symmetric exchange of information with others. A Nash equilibrium is reached when each player, constrained by the strategy of the others, cannot improve further its own criterion. Specific real and virtual symmetric Nash games are implemented to set up an optimization strategy for design under conflict.

673,"Life, information theory, probability, and physics","A purely information-theoretical approach to the problem of self-replication of elementary living units implies that pure chance is the determining factor in the formation of the first living unit. The probability of such a spontaneous formation can be calculated from the minimum amount of information which an organism must possess in order to replicate itself. An estimation of this amount of information is made here by two different methods. First by a “paper and pencil experiment” which indicates the minimum amount of information needed on a printed page in order that with given tools the page could be reproduced. Second—by an analytical consideration of some hypothetical molecular mechanisms. A general method for handling such problems is suggested. On the basis of estimated information contents it is shown that under most favorable conditions the probability of a spontaneous generation by pure chance during the lifetime of the earth is vanishingly small. It is concluded that dynamic factors, which may reduce tremendously the information content, must play a role in the genesis of life on earth.",N.

675,"Median spheres: theory, algorithms, applications","A generalized hypersphere is either a hyperplane or a hypersphere, which consists of all points equidistant from a center. Geometrically, a weighted median hypersphere minimizes a weighted average of the distances from it to finitely many data points. As proved here, for each finite data set there exists at least one weighted median generalized hypersphere. Moreover, denote the sums of the weights of the data points inside by W
−, outside by W
+, and on the hypersphere by W
0. The present results show that each weighted median hypersphere is a weighted pseudo-halving hypersphere, in the sense that |W
− − W
+| < W
0, and passes through at least two distinct data points. Combinatorically, a hypersphere is blocked if and only if it passes through data points in general position, in the sense that no other hypersphere passes through the same data points. A hypersphere is a halving hypersphere if and only if it is blocked, contains exactly k data points inside, confines exactly ℓ data points outside, and |k − ℓ| ≤ 1. In the plane, the present results also show that if a median circle is not a halving circle, then moving its center along a median between two data points on it until it passes through the next data point yields a halving circle. Relative to the center, if the direction cosines of the external and internal data points have the same mean and variance, then the median circle must be blocked, and stays so under sufficiently small perturbations of the data. Moreover, for every set of four points, at least one unweighted median circle is blocked.

Thus, for example, the notions are appropriate in the context of semi-definite programming. We prove various theorems to demonstrate how the notions can be used in analyzing interior-point methods.

It represents an effective tool to turn unrated assets, such as commercial papers or lease contracts, into marketable financial products through the issuance of special notes, namely the asset-backed securities.In this paper we analyze the problem of optimally selecting the assets to be converted into notes with respect to scenarios motivated by real-world problems. In particular, we study the case in which the assets amortization rule is characterized by constant periodic principal installments instead of the more classical amortization rule based on constant general (principal plus interests) installments. We show the computational advantages and the practical implications of this choice. The particular shape of the outstanding principal for the case of constant principal installments is exploited in the solution of a general model which selects assets at different dates.Four approximation algorithms, based on LP-relaxation and on the implicit knapsack structure of the problem, are proposed for this general model. From a theoretical point of view we analyze the exact worst-case behavior of these algorithms compared to the optimal solution. Computational experiments are performed for a practical scenario suggested by a leasing bank.

An important class of tensor decomposition is sum-of-squares (SOS) tensor decomposition. SOS tensor decomposition has a close connection with SOS polynomials, and SOS polynomials are very important in polynomial theory and polynomial optimization. In this paper, we give a detailed survey on recent advances of high-order SOS tensors and their applications. It first shows that several classes of symmetric structured tensors available in the literature have SOS decomposition in the even order symmetric case. Then, the SOS-rank for tensors with SOS decomposition and the SOS-width for SOS tensor cones are established. Further, a sharper explicit upper bound of the SOS-rank for tensors with bounded exponent is provided, and the exact SOS-width for the cone consists of all such tensors with SOS decomposition is identified.

680,"Phase locking, period doubling bifurcations and chaos in a mathematical model of a periodically driven oscillator: A theory for the entrainment of biological oscillators and the generation of cardiac dysrhythmias","A mathematical model for the perturbation of a biological oscillator by single and periodic impulses is analyzed. In response to a single stimulus the phase of the oscillator is changed. If the new phase following a stimulus is plotted against the old phase the resulting curve is called the phase transition curve or PTC (Pavlidis, 1973). There are two qualitatively different types of phase resetting. Using the terminology of Winfree (1977, 1980), large perturbations give a type 0 PTC (average slope of the PTC equals zero), whereas small perturbations give a type 1 PTC. The effects of periodic inputs can be analyzed by using the PTC to construct the Poincaré or phase advance map. Over a limited range of stimulation frequency and amplitude, the Poincaré map can be reduced to an interval map possessing a single maximum. Over this range there are period doubling bifurcations as well as chaotic dynamics. Numerical and analytical studies of the Poincaré map show that both phase locked and non-phase locked dynamics occur. We propose that cardiac dysrhythmias may arise from desynchronization of two or more spontaneously oscillating regions of the heart. This hypothesis serves to account for the various forms of atrioventricular (AV) block clinically observed. In particular 2∶2 and 4∶2 AV block can arise by period doubling bifurcations, and intermittent or variable AV block may be due to the complex irregular behavior associated with chaotic dynamics.",Michael R.

As applications, we prove that certain Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms supported in displaceable subsets have infinitely many nontrivial geometrically distinct periodic points, and we also significantly expand the class of coisotropic submanifolds which are known to have positive displacement energy. For instance, any coisotropic submanifold of contact type (in the sense of Bolle) in any closed symplectic manifold has positive displacement energy, as does any stable coisotropic submanifold of a Stein manifold. We also show that any stable coisotropic submanifold admits a Riemannian metric that makes its characteristic foliation totally geodesic, and that this latter, weaker, condition is enough to imply positive displacement energy under certain topological hypotheses.",Michael Usher,Israel Journal of Mathematics,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11856-011-0058-9,"Periodic Point,Symplectic Manifold,Closed Geodesic,Characteristic Foliation,Stein Manifold"

Each molecule attracts and repels the others with forces varying as inverse powers of the distance. The diameter of a spherical space is calculated, assuming that these spaces are closely packed, so that it is taken to vary with temperature. In the calculation of properties, such as L

685,A contribution to Rashevsky’s mathematical theory of development,"The application of Rashevsky’s transformationT to a primordial graph yields a set of graphs corresponding to different stages in the development of the organism. However, sinceT is multiple-valued the graphs obtained are not ordered. To obtain an ordering, it is first shown that the set of graphs under consideration is equivalent to a well defined setO (for “organism”) ofn-tuples. A metric is then introduced which is based on a biological consideration discussed by Rashevsky (Bull. Math. Biophysics,16, 317–348, 1954). Since a metric implies an ordering of the setO, with a knowledge of the structure of the primordial, one can obtain the developmental sequence. Unfortunately, at present, the structure of the primordial graph is unknown which makes the direct application of the above principle impossible. Consequently, an indirect approach which makes use of more accessible biological phenomena is discussed as well. The hypothesis thatrate of development decreases exponentially and the implications this has with regard to the metric onO are discussed. It is shown that if the hypothesis is accepted the search for the developmental sequence is narrowed.",Edward G.

686,Machine Learning Versus Semidefinite Programming Approach to a Particular Problem of the Theory of Open Quantum Systems,"AbstractMost of the problems of theoretical quantum physics are characterized by a high complexity. Practically, this means that solution of such a problem demands computational effort and resources that often scale exponentially with the size of the quantum model and the solution can be obtained—even for relatively small models—only by resorting to high performance computing (HPC) technologies. Here we discuss a particular problem of the theory of open quantum systems, the so-called ‘‘Markovianity problem’’. To get the answer to the question whether a given quantum map can be obtained as the result of a time-continuous open quantum evolution, one needs to implement an algorithm whose complexity grows exponentially with the dimension of the model’s Hilbert space. We discuss how machine learning (ML) methods can be used to get the answer and provide some evidence for potential efficiency of the ML-based approach. We demonstrate that neural networks that are used to classify images can be used to determine the boundary between answers ‘‘yes’’ and ‘‘no’’ in the parameter space of a particular open quantum model. For an open model consisting of two qubits, our ML algorithm is able to give correct answer with \(97\%\) accuracy. The computational experiments were performed on the Lomonosov-2 supercomputer.","I.

Given finite sets \({\mathcal{R}}\) of resources and \({\mathcal{C}}\) of customers, a convex set \({\mathcal{B}_c}\), called block, and a convex function \({g_c:\mathcal{B}_c\to\mathbb{R}_{+}^{\mathcal{R}}}\) for every \({c\in\mathcal{C}}\), the task is to find \({b_c\in\mathcal{B}_c\ (c\in\mathcal{C})}\) approximately attaining \({\lambda^*:=\inf\{\max_{r\in\mathcal{R}}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}}(g_c(b_c))_r \mid b_c\in\mathcal{B}_c\ (c\in\mathcal{C})\}}\). As usual we assume that g

c
 can be computed efficiently and we have a constant σ ≥ 1 and oracle functions \({f_c : \mathbb{R}_{+}^{\mathcal{R}} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}_c}\), called block solvers, which for \({c \in \mathcal{C}}\) and \({y \in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{\mathcal{R}}}\) return an element \({b_c \in \mathcal{B}_c}\) with \({y^{\scriptscriptstyle\top}{g_c(b_c)} \leq \sigma \inf_{b \in \mathcal{B}_c} y^{\scriptscriptstyle\top}{g_c(b)}}\). We describe a simple algorithm which solves this problem with an approximation guarantee σ(1 + ω) for any ω > 0, and whose running time is \({O(\theta(|\mathcal{C}|+|\mathcal{R}|) \log|\mathcal{R}|(\log\log|\mathcal{R}|+\omega^{-2}))}\) for any fixed σ ≥ 1, where θ is the time for an oracle call. This generalizes and improves various previous results. We also prove other bounds and describe several speed-up techniques. In particular, we show how to parallelize the algorithm efficiently. In addition we review another algorithm, variants of which were studied before. We show that this algorithm is almost as fast in theory, but it was not competitive in our experiments. Our work was motivated mainly by global routing in chip design. Here the blocks are mixed-integer sets (whose elements are associated with Steiner trees), and we combine our algorithm with randomized rounding. We present experimental results on instances resulting from recent industrial chips, with millions of customers and resources. Our algorithm solves these instances nearly optimally in less than two hours.","Dirk Müller1, Klaus Radke2 & Jens Vygen",Mathematical Programming Computation,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12532-011-0023-y,"Min–max resource sharing,Fractional packing,Fully polynomial approximation scheme,Parallelization,Global routing,Chip design"

By taking the view that artificial recurrent neural nets are dynamical systems described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), new neural nets were recently derived in the literature using a unified control Liapunov function (CLF) approach, after interpreting the zero finding problem as a regulation problem for a closed-loop continuous-time dynamical system. The resulting neural net or continuous-time ODE is discretized by Euler’s method and the discretization step size interpreted as a control which is chosen so as to optimize the decrement in the chosen CLF, along system trajectories. Given the viewpoint adopted in this article, the words dynamical system, ODE and neural net are used interchangeably. For standard test functions of two variables, the basins of attraction are found by numerical simulation, starting from a uniformly distributed grid of initial points. For the chosen test functions, analysis of the basins shows a correlation between regularity of the basin boundaries and the predictability of convergence to a zero. In addition, this analysis suggests how to construct a team algorithm with favorable convergence properties.",Fernando A.

694,H.S.M. Coxeter’s Theory of Accessibility: From Mario Pieri to Marvin Greenberg,"In the 1960s, H. S. M. Coxeter adopted a set of incidence axioms similar to one O. Veblen and J. W. Young proposed in 1910, to study projective spaces for which a field of elements of a commutative number system is an algebraic model. Coxeter introduced a theory called “accessibility,” which is applicable to the study of conics defined in 1847 by G. K. C. von Staudt, and the partitioning of projective planes in terms of them. In a conversation of 1989, Coxeter revealed that he used ideas from an 1898 paper of M. Pieri to define the relation of accessible points in a continuity-independent projective plane. In 1979, M.J. Greenberg reinterpreted that relation in such a plane using incidence and order axioms from another of Coxeter’s works. We compare the axiomatic bases on which Coxeter, Greenberg, and Pieri construct projective planes with and without continuity, using synthetic methods to introduce analytic ones. We show how several of their publications intersect in significant ways. Other paths emerge from these investigations, such as one that examines the origins of a statement postulated by Pieri, often credited to Pasch, which Coxeter attributed to Veblen.","Elena Anne Corie Marchisotto

This complex is then used in Novikov theory, to obtain a geometric realization of the Novikov Complex as a complex of currents and a new characterization of Novikov Homology as cohomology with compact forward supports.

In this paper, the consolidation problem of unsaturated soil is investigated based on the theory of mixture. A theoretical formula of effective stress on anisotropic porous media and unsaturated soil is derived. The principle of effective stress and the principle of Curie symmetry are taken as two fundamental constitutive principles of unsaturated soil. A mathematical model of consolidation of unsaturated soil is proposed, which consists of 25 partial differenfial equations with 25 unknowns. With the help of increament linearizing method, the model is reduced to 5 governing equations with 5 unknowns, i.e., the three displacement components of solid phase, the pore water pressure and the pore gas pressure, 7 material parameters are involved in the model and all of them can be measured using soil tests. It is convenient to use the model to engineering practice. The well known Biot's theory is a special case of the model.","Chen Zheng-han1, Xie Ding-yi2 & Liu Zu-dian",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,1993,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02453355,"unsaturated soil,consolidation,theory of mixture,effective stress,the principle of Curie symmetry"

The aim of this paper is precisely to describe the heuristic path by which in 1827 Jacobi succeeded in finding these transformation formulae.

713,Tilting Theory and Functor Categories I. Classical Tilting,"Tilting theory has been a very important tool in the classification of finite dimensional algebras of finite and tame representation type, as well as, in many other branches of mathematics. Happel (1988) and Cline et al. (J Algebra 304:397–409 1986) proved that generalized tilting induces derived equivalences between module categories, and tilting complexes were used by Rickard (J Lond Math Soc 39:436–456, 1989) to develop a general Morita theory of derived categories. On the other hand, functor categories were introduced in representation theory by Auslander (I Commun Algebra 1(3):177–268, 1974), Auslander (1971) and used in his proof of the first Brauer–Thrall conjecture (Auslander 1978) and later on, used systematically in his joint work with I. Reiten on stable equivalence (Auslander and Reiten, Adv Math 12(3):306–366, 1974), Auslander and Reiten (1973) and many other applications. Recently, functor categories were used in Martínez-Villa and Solberg (J Algebra 323(5):1369–1407, 2010) to study the Auslander–Reiten components of finite dimensional algebras. The aim of this paper is to extend tilting theory to arbitrary functor categories, having in mind applications to the functor category Mod (modΛ), with Λ a finite dimensional algebra.",R.

A previously outlined theory of the form of plants is developed further, showing how the conditions of mechanical strength together with the specifications of the total mass and metabolism, may quantitatively determine not only the general form of the plant, but even the number, size, shape and shades of the leaves. Next the form of animals, as required by mechanical conditions and by the different types of possible locomotions is discussed. A mathematical theory of locomotion of snakes in relation to their shape is outlined. Next is discussed the form and locomotion of quadrupeds. A number of theoretical relations, which describe the shape of an animal, are derived and compared to available observations. After that the theory of flight of birds and insects is discussed, and again some form relations comparable with observations, are discussed. Finally a set of equations is outlined, which determines not only the external shape, but also the internal structure of animals. Different relations pertaining to some inner organs are derived and compared with available observations. The paper ends with a brief discussion on the shape of unicellular organisms.",N.

715,A theory of spectral partitions of metric graphs,"We introduce an abstract framework for the study of clustering in metric graphs: after suitably metrising the space of graph partitions, we restrict Laplacians to the clusters thus arising and use their spectral gaps to define several notions of partition energies; this is the graph counterpart of the well-known theory of spectral minimal partitions on planar domains and includes the setting in Band et al. (Commun Math Phys 311:815–838, 2012) as a special case. We focus on the existence of optimisers for a large class of functionals defined on such partitions, but also study their qualitative properties, including stability, regularity, and parameter dependence. We also discuss in detail their interplay with the theory of nodal partitions. Unlike in the case of domains, the one-dimensional setting of metric graphs allows for explicit computation and analytic—rather than numerical—results. Not only do we recover the main assertions in the theory of spectral minimal partitions on domains, as studied in Conti et al. (Calc Var 22:45–72, 2005), Helffer et al. (Ann Inst Henri Poincaré Anal Non Linéaire 26:101–138, 2009), but we can also generalise some of them and answer (the graph counterparts of) a few open questions.","James B.

It is proved that the normal closure over K of a pure cubic extension of F contains a certain pure cubic extension of K. The proposed proof can be generalized to radicals of any prime degree q. In the case where the base field K is the field of rational numbers and the field F is embedded in the cyclotomic extension obtained by adding the pth roots of unity, the corresponding simple radical extension of the field of rational numbers is explicitly constructed. The proof of the main result illustrates Hilbert’s Theorem 90. An example of a particular formula generalizing Ramanujan’s formulas for degree 5 is given. A necessary condition for nested radical expressions of depth 2 to be contained in the normal closure of a pure cubic extension of the field F is given.",I. A. Krepkii1 & K. I.

718,Simple theory of transfusions,"A transfusion can be hypothesized to be required when a determination factor (D=probability of adverse effects if transfusion not given/adverse effects if transfusion is given) exceeds some predetermined value.D varies between the limits 0 and ∞, and in most clinical situations will be a small number on the order of 20. Since the probabilities contributing to the denominator ofD are essentially independent of each other, they can be summed to obtain the probability of ill effects. A method of handling an exception to this, the incompatibility reactions following multiple transfusions within a short time interval, is pointed out. The probability of adverse effects if a transfusion is not given is more difficult to evaluate; values gathered from the literature are presented, as well as methods for obtaining further data. Two techniques for estimating future transfusion requirements are discussed. One is a correlative procedure, which functions by analyzing similar cases admitted to the hospital. The second procedure is an estimate of stability (homeostasis), based on a parameter introduced by B. C. Patten (Scince,134, 1010–1011, 1961).

719,Analysis of the ∈-Expansion in Turbulence Theory: Approximate Renormalization Group for Diffusion of a Passive Scalar in a Random Velocity Field,"The validity of the ∈-expansion in the turbulence problem is discussed using the example of diffusion of a passive scalar in a random velocity field. A generalization of Wilson's rule for calculating a diagram of arbitrary order is introduced. The resulting perturbation series, while having zero radius of convergence, is summed exactly yielding amplitudes which differ from those obtained to lowest order in the ∈-expansion by only a few percent. The properties of the expansion are analyzed in detail and it is shown that various subsets of diagrams, while differing by an infinite number of terms, give close results in the vicinity of the fixed point. This indicates nontrivial compensation of high-order interactions in turbulence. The irrelevance of high-order couplings is demonstrated for arbitrary values of ∈. The quality the approximation is tested by comparison with numerical experiments on diffusion of a passive scalar in a band-limited random velocity field in the limit of infinite Peclet number.",Steven A.

720,"Towards a (Max,+) Control Theory for Public Transportation Networks","We consider the modelling and analysisof public transportation networks, such as railway or subwaynetworks, governed by a timetable. Specifically, we study a (max,+)-linearmodel of a generic transportation network and thereby give aself-contained introduction to the key ideas underlying the (max,+)algebra. We elaborate on the algebraic structure implied by the(max,+)-model to formulate (and solve) the control problem inthe deterministic as well as in the stochastic case. The controlproblem is here whether a train should wait on a connecting trainwhich is delayed. Our objective is then to minimise the propagationof the delay through the network while maintaining as many connectionsas possible. With respect to the deterministic control problem,we present some recent ideas concerning the use of (max,+)-techniquesfor analysing the propagation of delays. Moreover, we show howone can use the (max,+)-algebra to drastically reduce the searchspace for the deterministic control problem. For the stochasticcontrol problem, we consider a parameterised version of the controlproblem, that is, we describe the control policy by means ofa real-valued parameter, say Θ. Finding theoptimal control is then turned into an optimisation problem withrespect to Θ. We address the problem by incorporatingan estimator of the derivative of the expected performance withrespect to Θ into a stochastic approximationalgorithm.",B.

721,Extreme value theory for continuous parameter stationary processes,"In this paper the central distributional results of classical extreme value theory are obtained, under appropriate dependence restrictions, for maxima of continuous parameter stochastic processes. In particular we prove the basic result (here called Gnedenko's Theorem) concerning the existence of just three types of non-degenerate limiting distributions in such cases, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for each to apply. The development relies, in part, on the corresponding known theory for stationary sequences.The general theory given does not require finiteness of the number of upcrossings of any levelx. However when the number per unit time is a.s. finite and has a finite meanμ(x), it is found that the classical criteria for domains of attraction apply whenμ(x) is used in lieu of the tail of the marginal distribution function. The theory is specialized to this case and applied to give the general known results for stationary normal processes for whichμ(x) may or may not be finite).A general Poisson convergence theorem is given for high level upcrossings, together with its implications for the asymptotic distributions ofr

722,Organismic sets: Outline of a general theory of biological and social organisms,"The discussion as to whether societies are organisms andvice versa has been going on for a long time. The question is meaningless unless a clear definition of the term “organism” is made. Once such a definition is made, the question may be answered by studying whether there exists any relational isomorphism between what the biologist calls an organism and what the sociologist calls society. Such a study should also include animal societies studied by ecologists. Both human and animal societies are sets of individuals together with certain other objects which are the products of their activities. A multicellular organism is a set of cells together with some products of their activities. A cell itself may be regarded as a set of genes together with the products of their activities because every component of the cell is either directly or indirectly the result of the activities of the genes. Thus it is natural to define both biological and social organisms as special kinds of sets. A number of definitions are given in this paper which define what we call here organismic sets. Postulates are introduced which characterize such sets, and a number of conclusions are drawn. It is shown that an organismic set, as defined here, does represent some basic relational aspects of both biological organisms and societies. In particular a clarification and a sharpening of the Postulate of Relational Forces given previously (Bull. Math. Biophysics,28, 283–308, 1966) is presented. It is shown that from the basic definitions and postulates of the theory of organismic sets, it folows that only such elements of those sets will aggregate spontaneously, which are not completely “specialized” in the performance of only one activity. It is further shown that such “non-specialized” elements undergo a process of specialization, and as a result of it their spontaneous aggregation into organismic sets becomes impossible. This throws light on the problem of the origin of life on Earth and the present absence of the appearance of life by spontaneous generation. Some applications to problems of ontogenesis and philogenesis are made. Finally the relation between physics, biology, and sociology is discussed in the light of the theory of organismic sets.",N.

724,A Theory of Stationary Trees and the Balanced Baumgartner–Hajnal–Todorcevic Theorem for Trees,"Building on early work by Stevo Todorcevic, we develop a theory of stationary subtrees of trees of successor-cardinal height. We define the diagonal union of subsets of a tree, as well as normal ideals on a tree, and we characterize arbitrary subsets of a non-special tree as being either stationary or non-stationary.We then use this theory to prove the following partition relation for trees:
Main Theorem. Let
\({\kappa}\)
be any infinite regular cardinal, let
ξ be any ordinal such that
\({2^{|\xi|} < \kappa}\), and let k be any natural number. Then
$$non-(2^{<\kappa})-special\, tree \rightarrow (\kappa + \xi)^{2}_k.$$This is a generalization to trees of the Balanced Baumgartner–Hajnal–Todorcevic Theorem, which we recover by applying the above to the cardinal \({(2^{< \kappa})^{+}}\), the simplest example of a non-\({(2^{< \kappa})}\)-special tree.As a corollary, we obtain a general result for partially ordered sets:
Theorem. Let
\({\kappa}\)
be any infinite regular cardinal, let
ξ be any ordinal such that
\({2^{|\xi|} < \kappa}\), and let k be any natural number. Let
P
be a partially ordered set such that

The theoretical basis for the algorithm is the potential theory for mean payoff games. This theory allows one to restate the problem in terms of solving systems of algebraic equations with minima and maxima. Also, in order to solve the mean payoff game problem, the arc reweighting technique is used. To this end, simple modifications, which do not change the set of winning strategies, are applied to the game graph; in the end, a trivial instance of the problem is obtained. It is shown that any game graph can be simplified by n reweightings. Bibliography: 16 titles.",Y. M. Lifshits1 & D. S.

This framework relies heavily on the expression of the RAS dynamics in the modeling framework of the Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets (GSPNs), and the employment of this GSPN-based representation towards the establishment of a systematic trade-off between the representational economy of the target scheduling policies and their operational efficiency. In this paper, we enhance the representational economy of the target policies in the aforementioned framework by taking advantage of some notions of “(non-)conflict” in the transitional dynamics of the underlying RAS-modeling GSPNs. A series of numerical experiments demonstrate that the representational gains resulting from the presented methodology can be very substantial.",Ran Li1 & Spyros Reveliotis,Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10626-015-0219-9,"Generalized stochastic petri nets,Performance optimization,Scheduling,Structural analysis,Sequential resource allocation systems"

To formulate a good Morse theory we use an appropriate definition of geodesic, introduced in the cited work. The main theorem of this paper (see Theorem 3.6, section 3) proofs that, although the energy is nonsmooth, we can find a continuous retraction of its sublevels in absence of critical points. So, we can give a good definition of index for isolated critical values and for isolated critical points. We prove that Morse relations hold and, at last, we give a definition of multiplicity of geodesics which is geometrical meaningful.

737,Quantum theory and crystal physics,The fundamental notions of quantum theory and thermodynamics indicate that a crystal should be regarded as an assembly of an immense number of oscillators whose energy states are quantised and which form a system in thermodynamic equilibrium. They also indicate that the spectroscopic properties and the thermal behaviour of crystals stand in the closest relation to each other. We are thus left with the problem of discovering and enumerating the oscillators of the different sorts comprised in the crystal and of determining their scheme of energy levels. This may be done by methods analogous to those which have proved successful in the field of molecular spectroscopy.

For the case when small-amplitude waves are generated in a medium with small anisotropy a qualitative analysis shows that these problems have nonunique solutions when it is assumed that the solutions involve Riemann waves and evolutionary discontinuities. The above-mentioned problems are considered as limits of properly formulated problems for visco-elastic media when the viscosity tends to zero or (what is the same) that time tends to infinity. It is numerically found that all above-mentioned inviscid solutions can represent the asymptotics of visco-elastic solutions. The type of asymptotics depends on those details of the visco-elastic problem formulation which are absent when formulating inviscid selfsimilar problems. Similar considerations are made for elastic media with dispersion along with dissipation which are manifested in small-scale processes. In such media the number of available asymptotics (as t→∞) for the above-mentioned solutions depends on a relation between dispersion and dissipation and can be large. Thus, two possible causes for the nonuniqueness of solutions to the equations of elasticity theory are investigated.","A. G. Kulikovskii1, A. P. Chugainova1 & E. I.

This theorem was demonstrated previously for the case of a rather special choice of the satisfaction function. It is now shown that it holds for a much wider class of such functions. In addition to previously studied cases of methods of sharing the object of satisfaction, several new cases are investigated. An attempt is made to give a mathematical formulation for a society in which individuals contribute according to their ability and share according to their needs. It is shown that in order for such a description to be meaningful, certain requirements must be imposed on the satisfaction function. Even with those requirements fulfilled, the possibility of such a society requires the fulfillment of an inequality between certain functionals.",N.

745,Construction of a linear K-system in Hamiltonian Floer theory,"The notion of linear K-system was introduced by the present authors as an abstract model arising from the structure of compactified moduli spaces of solutions to Floer’s equation in the book (Fukaya et al. in Springer monographs in mathematics, Springer, Berlin, 2020). The purpose of the present article is to provide a geometric realization of the linear K-system associated with solutions to Floer’s equation in the Morse–Bott setting. Immediate consequences [when combined with the abstract theory from Fukaya et al. (Springer monographs in mathematics, Springer, Berlin, 2020)] are the construction of Floer cohomology for periodic Hamiltonian systems on general compact symplectic manifolds without any restriction, and the construction of an isomorphism over the Novikov ring between the Floer cohomology and the singular cohomology of the underlying symplectic manifold. The present article utilizes various analytical results on pseudoholomorphic curves established in our earlier papers and books. However, the paper itself is geometric in nature, and does not presume much prior knowledge of Kuranishi structures and their construction but assumes only the elementary part thereof, and results from Fukaya et al. (Surv Differ Geom 22:133–190, 2018) and Fukaya et al. (Exponential decay estimate and smoothness of the moduli space of pseudoholomorphic curves) on their construction, and the standard knowledge on Hamiltonian Floer theory. We explain the general procedure of the construction of a linear K-system by explaining in detail the inductive steps of ensuring the compatibility conditions for the system of Kuranishi structures leading to a linear K-system for the case of Hamiltonian Floer theory.","Kenji Fukaya1, Yong-Geun Oh2,3, Hiroshi Ohta4 & …Kaoru Ono",Journal of Fixed Point Theory and Applications,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11784-022-00960-x,"53D40,53D35,58D27,57P99"

Typically, a preparation of a given polymer with unknown sequence is purified and then subjected to an enzyme known to cut the polymer at certain specific sites. The quantities and sequences of the resulting fragments are determined. For RNA primary sequences, pancreatic ribonuclease and T1 ribonuclease are ordinarily used as fragmenting enzymes. A technique is described for evaluating such fragment data. It has the following properties: It is easily determined whether or not the fragment data is inconsistent. It is always possible to determine the first and last nucleotides of the unknown sequence from the data of two limit digests. Consistent data from two limit digests can always be fitted into a convenient conceptual framework developed within the theory of graphs. In most cases, partial digest information can be used to modify the framework constructed from two limit digests, as such information is obtained. An efficient analysis of all fragment data in this conceptual framework can always be made.

This paper solves the problem by extending Gröbner basis theory. The authors first present a division of the set of elementary indexed differential monomials \(E_{\partial\kern-0.35em\raise0.22ex\hbox{/}}\) into disjoint subsets, by defining an equivalence relation on \(E_{\partial\kern-0.35em\raise0.22ex\hbox{/}}\) based on Leibniz expansions of monomials. The equivalence relation on \(E_{\partial\kern-0.35em\raise0.22ex\hbox{/}}\) also induces a division of a Gröbner basis of basic syzygies into disjoint subsets. Furthermore, the authors prove that the dummy index numbers of the sim-monomials of the elements in each equivalence class of \(E_{\partial\kern-0.35em\raise0.22ex\hbox{/}}\) have upper bounds, and use the upper bounds to construct fundamental restricted rings. Finally, the canonical form of an indexed differential polynomial proves to be the normal form with respect to a subset of the Gröbner basis in the fundamental restricted ring.","Jiang Liu1, Feng Ni1, Shihang Song1 & …Mingjun Du",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-021-0302-2,"Canonical form,Einstein summation convention,free commutative monoid ring,Gröbner basis,indexed differential polynomial"
760,Weakly nonlinear theory versus theory of secondary instability for plane poiseuille flow,In [1] the theory of secondary instability for plane Poiseuille flow was proposed. In this paper the weakly nonlinear theory is used to investigate the same problem. The results are consistent with those of the theory of secondary instability. It indicates that for plane Poiseuille flow there exists a certain intrinsic relation between the weakly nonlinear theory and the theory of secondary instability.,Zhao Geng-fu1 & Zhou Heng,Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,1988,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02465691,"Boundary Layer Flow,Nonlinear Theory,Secondary Instability,Dimensional Wave,Plane Poiseuille Flow"

762,A wavelet theory for local fields and related groups,"Let G be a locally compact abelian group with compact open subgroup H. The best known example of such a group is G = ℚp, the field of padic rational numbers (as a group under addition), which has compact open subgroup H = ℤp, the ring of padic integers. Classical wavelet theories, which require a non trivial discrete subgroup for translations, do not apply to G, which may not have such a subgroup. A wavelet theory is developed on G using coset representatives of the discrete quotient Ĝ/H⊥ to circumvent this limitation. Wavelet bases are constructed by means of an iterative method giving rise to socalled wavelet sets in the dual group Ĝ. Although the Haar and Shannon wavelets are naturally antipodal in the Euclidean setting, it is observed that their analogues for G are equivalent.","John J. Benedetto1,2 & Robert L.

The integrals which we consider here are in the general Denjoy sense, except those with respect to the random parameters, which exist in the Lebesgue sense defined on a probability space. The importance of our stochastic analysis lies in the completion that a minimum not attained in the classical sense may be, and frequently is, attained in the stochastic case.","S. N. Chuang1, T. T.

n, a monochromatic configurationL which is congruent toK exists.A configurationK is Ramsey if the following holds: For every positive integerr, a positive integern=n(K, r) exists such that, for allm≥n, R(K, m, r) holds.A configuration is spherical if it can be embedded in the surface of a sphere inn-space, providedn is sufficiently large. It is relatively easy to show that if a configuration is Ramsey, it must be spherical. Accordingly, a good fraction of the research efforts in Euclidean Ramsey theory is devoted to determining which spherical configurations are Ramsey. It is known that then-dimensional measure polytopes (the higher-dimensional analogs of a cube), then-dimensional simplex, and the regular polyhedra inR

Furthermore, the edges of any edge-Ramsey configuration must all have the same length. It is conjectured that the unit square is edge-Ramsey, and it is natural to ask the more general question: Which regular polytopes are edge-Ramsey?In this article it is shown that then-dimensional measure polytope and then-dimensional cross polytope are edge-Ramsey.

779,Contribution to the linkage theory of autopolyploids: I,"A theory of linkage of autopolyploids is developed under consideration ofm loci andr alleles. The simplifying assumption of chromosome segregation, which may be considered as an approximation to the more adequate theory of chromatid segregation, is made throughout. Random mating and distinct, non-overlapping generations are assumed. Under these assumptions the problem is determined by three basic probability distributions—the distributions of genotypes and of gametes, and the segregation distribution. The segregation distribution is assumed to be the same for males and for females. The aim of the paper is to establish recurrence formulas (which allow to find the distributions of gametes and of genotypes from generation to generation, if the distribution of genotypes for an initial generation is known) and to investigate the limit behavior of these distributions as the number of generations increases indefinitely.In the present paper (hereafter referred to as I) the problem is explained, and the three characteristic distributions are introduced for the general case of a 2s-ploid,m loci, andr alleles. Recurrence relations are established for tetraploids,s=2 andm=2 loci, while the recurrence relations for the general case as well as the limit theorems will be given in the second part of this paper (hereafter referred to as II).",Hilda Geiringer,The bulletin of mathematical biophysics,1949,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02477494,"Marginal Distribution,Haldane,Chromosome Segregation,Marginal Probability,Recurrence Formula"

796,Group theory analysis of mixed convection over a horizontal moving plate,"In the present paper, the investigation to the mixed convective boundary-layer behavior over a horizontal plate is carried out. By applying transformation group theory, the analysis of the governing equations of continuity, momentum, energy and diffusion shows the existence of similarity solution for the problem provided that the temperature and concentration at the wall are proportional to\(x^{4/(7 - 5^n )}\) and that the moving speed of the plate is proportional to\(x^{(3 - x)/(7 - 5^n )}\), furthermore, a set of similarity equations is obtained. The similarity equations are solved numerically by a fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme. The numerical results obtained for velocity, temperature and concentration distributions for Pr=0.72 and various values of the parameters Sc, K1, K2 and K3 reveals the influence of these parameters on the flow, and heat and mass transfer behavior.","Xu Xuezi1, Shi Junmei2 & Fan Jianren",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,1997,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02454121,"mixed convection,group theory,similarity solution"

805,A relational theory of biological systems II,"The general Theory of Categories is applied to the study of the (M, R)-systems previously defined. A set of axioms is provided which characterize “abstract (M, R)-systems”, defined in terms of the Theory of Categories. It is shown that the replication of the repair components of these systems may be accounted for in a natural way within this framework, thereby obviating the need for anad hoc postulation of a replication mechanism.A time-lag structure is introduced into these abstract (M, R)-systems. In order to apply this structure to a discussion of the “morphology” of these systems, it is necessary to make certain assumptions which relate the morphology to the time lags. By so doing, a system of abstract biology is in effect constructed. In particular, a formulation of a general Principle of Optimal Design is proposed for these systems. It is shown under what conditions the repair mechanism of the system will be localized into a spherical region, suggestive of the nuclear arrangements in cells. The possibility of placing an abstract (M, R)-system into optimal form in more than one way is then investigated, and a necessary and sufficient condition for this occurrence is obtained. Some further implications of the above assumptions are then discussed.",Robert Rosen,The bulletin of mathematical biophysics,1959,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02476354,"Canonical Form,Relational Theory,Optimal Form,Abstract System,Environmental Input"

808,A theory of evolution that includes prebiotic self-organization and episodic species formation,"A theory has been proposed that encompasses pre-replication changes in RNA synthesis and non-gradual variant formation, in addition to competitive replication. Using a fundamental theorem of natural selection and maximum principle scaled to nucleotide condensation, evolutionin vitro was demonstrated to maximally damp both kinetic and thermodynamic forces driving this reaction, from its pre-replication stage. This led to the finding that evolution follows a path of least action. These principles form the framework for a general theory of evolution, whose scope extends beyond evolution modeled by synthesis of non-interacting RNA molecules. It applies, in particular, to standard processes, such as competitive crystallization. In calculations simulatingde novo formation of self-replicating RNA molecules in the Qβ replicase system, spontaneous changes in strand secondary structure promoted the transition from random copolymerization to template-directed polymerization. This finding indicates selection preceded genome self-propagation. Non-gradual species formation was attributed to the presence of heterogeneous thermodynamic forces. Growth unconstrained by competition follows mutation to a variant able to utilize a free energy source alien to its progenitors. Evolution in a heterogeneous system can, therefore, exhibit discontinuous rates of species formation and spawn new species populations. Natural selection among competing self-propagators thus gives way to a principle of wider scope stating that evolution optimally damps the physicochemical forces causing change within an evolving system.",Brian K.

810,Some remarks on the mathematical theory of nutrition of fishes,"V. S. Ivlev [Experimental Ecology of Nutrition of Fishes, 1955, Moscow (in Russia)] has shown that the food uptake by fishes during a fixed interval of time is an exponential function of the concentration of food. Ivlev's equation is derived here, and it is shown that it can hold only for non-stationary conditions, such as prevailed in Ivlev's experiments. For a stationary state, the rate of food uptake should tend asymptotically to a limiting value as the concentration increases, but the variation is not exponential. Different other aspects of the problem are investigated, and definite new experimental procedures suggested. The implications of Ivlev's findings on the effect of non-uniformity of food distribution upon the rate of food consumption are studied from a mathematical point of view. The conclusion is reached that whereas a fish does not, in the process of eating, move directly to an individual food particle which it perceives, it does move more or less directly to large aggregates of particles, if the latter are distributed nonuniformly.",N.

811,Kac’s program in kinetic theory,"This paper is devoted to the study of propagation of chaos and mean-field limits for systems of indistinguishable particles, undergoing collision processes. The prime examples we will consider are the many-particle jump processes of Kac and McKean (Kac in Proceedings of the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability, 1954–1955, Vol. III, pp. 171–197, 1956; McKean in J. Comb. Theory 2:358–382, 1967) giving rise to the Boltzmann equation. We solve the conjecture raised by Kac (Proceedings of the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability, 1954–1955, Vol. III, pp. 171–197, 1956), motivating his program, on the rigorous connection between the long-time behavior of a collisional many-particle system and the one of its mean-field limit, for bounded as well as unbounded collision rates.Motivated by the inspirative paper by Grünbaum (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 42:323–345, 1971), we develop an abstract method that reduces the question of propagation of chaos to that of proving a purely functional estimate on generator operators (consistency estimates), along with differentiability estimates on the flow of the nonlinear limit equation (stability estimates). This allows us to exploit dissipativity at the level of the mean-field limit equation rather than the level of the particle system (as proposed by Kac).Using this method we show: (1) Quantitative estimates, that are uniform in time, on the chaoticity of a family of states. (2) Propagation of entropic chaoticity, as defined by Carlen et al. (Kinet. Relat. Models 3:85–122, 2010). (3) Estimates on the time of relaxation to equilibrium, that are independent of the number of particles in the system. Our results cover the two main Boltzmann physical collision processes with unbounded collision rates: hard spheres and true Maxwell molecules interactions. The proof of the stability estimates for these models requires significant analytic efforts and new estimates.",Stéphane Mischler1 & Clément Mouhot,Inventiones mathematicae,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-012-0422-3,"Kac’s program,Kinetic theory,Master equation,Mean-field limit,Quantitative,Uniform in time,Jump process,Collision process,Boltzmann equation,Maxwell molecules,Non-cutoff,Hard spheres"

We introduce a new complexity parameter, which depends on the geometry of T, and show that it suffices to choose s and m such that this parameter is small. Our result is a sparse analog of Gordon’s theorem, which was concerned with a dense \({\Phi}\) having i.i.d. Gaussian entries. We qualitatively unify several results related to the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma, subspace embeddings, and Fourier-based restricted isometries. Our work also implies new results in using the sparse Johnson–Lindenstrauss transform in numerical linear algebra, classical and model-based compressed sensing, manifold learning, and constrained least squares problems such as the Lasso.","Jean Bourgain1, Sjoerd Dirksen2 & Jelani Nelson",Geometric and Functional Analysis,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00039-015-0332-9,"Unify Theory,Random Projection,Restricted Isometry Property,Numerical Linear Algebra,Lindenstrauss Lemma"

The topological characterization of Kodaira fibrations is emblematic of the use of topological methods in the study of moduli spaces of surfaces and higher dimensional complex algebraic varieties, and their compactifications. Our tour through algebraic surfaces and their moduli (with results valid also for higher dimensional varieties) deals with fibrations, questions on monodromy and factorizations in the mapping class group, old and new results on Variation of Hodge Structures, especially a recent answer given (in joint work with Dettweiler) to a long standing question posed by Fujita. In the landscape of our tour, Galois coverings, deformations and rigid manifolds (there are by the way rigid Kodaira fibrations), projective classifying spaces, the action of the absolute Galois group on moduli spaces, stand also in the forefront. These questions lead to interesting algebraic surfaces, for instance remarkable surfaces constructed from VHS, surfaces isogenous to a product with automorphisms acting trivially on cohomology, hypersurfaces in Bagnera-de Franchis varieties, Inoue-type surfaces.",Fabrizio Catanese,Japanese Journal of Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11537-017-1569-x,"algebraic surfaces,Kähler manifolds,moduli,deformations,topological methods,fibrations,Kodaira fibrations,Chern slope,automorphisms,uniformization,projective classifying spaces,monodromy,fundamental groups,variation of Hodge structure,absolute Galois group,locally symmetric varieties"
817,First Colonization of a Spectral Outpost in Random Matrix Theory,"We describe the distribution of the first finite number of eigenvalues in a newly-forming band of the spectrum of the random Hermitian matrix model. The method is rigorously based on the Riemann–Hilbert analysis of the corresponding orthogonal polynomials. We provide an analysis with an error term of order N
−2γ where 1/γ=2ν+2 is the exponent of non-regularity of the effective potential, thus improving even in the usual case the analysis of the pertinent literature.The behavior of the first finite number of zeroes (eigenvalues) appearing in the new band is analyzed and connected with the location of the zeroes of certain Freud polynomials. In general, all these newborn zeroes approach the point of nonregularity at the rate N
−γ, whereas one (a stray zero) lags behind at a slower rate of approach. The kernels for the correlator functions in the scaling coordinate near the emerging band are provided together with the subleading term.

818,Historical development of Teichmüller theory,"Originally, the expression “Teichmüller theory” referred to the theory that Oswald Teichmüller developed on deformations and on moduli spaces of marked Riemann surfaces. This theory is not an isolated field in mathematics. At different stages of its development, it received strong impetuses from analysis, geometry, and algebraic topology, and it had a major impact on other fields, including low-dimensional topology, algebraic topology, hyperbolic geometry, geometric group theory, representations of discrete groups in Lie groups, symplectic geometry, topological quantum field theory, theoretical physics, and there are certainly others. Of course, the impacts on these various fields are not equally important, but in some cases (namely, low-dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, and physics) the impact was crucial. At the same time, Teichmüller theory established important connections between the fields mentioned. This, in part, is a consequence of the diversity and the richness of the structure that Teichmüller space itself carries. From a more subjective point of view, the result of pondering on these connections and applications demonstrates the unity of mathematics. The aim of this paper is to survey the origin of Teichmüller theory and the development of its early major ideas.",Lizhen Ji1 & Athanase Papadopoulos,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-012-0104-y,"Modulus Space,Riemann Surface,Complex Manifold,Quasiconformal Mapping,Quadratic Differential"
819,Embedded Factor Patterns for Deodhar Elements in Kazhdan-Lusztig Theory,"The Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for finite Weyl groups arise in the geometry of Schubert varieties and representation theory. It was proved very soon after their introduction that they have nonnegative integer coefficients, but no simple all positive interpretation for them is known in general. Deodhar [16] has given a framework for computing the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials which generally involves recursion. We define embedded factor pattern avoidance for general Coxeter groups and use it to characterize when Deodhar’s algorithm yields a simple combinatorial formula for the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of finite Weyl groups. Equivalently, if (W, S) is a Coxeter system for a finite Weyl group, we classify the elements w ∈ W for which the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis element \(C^{\prime}_{w}\) can be written as a monomial of \(C^{\prime}_{s}\) where s ∈ S.

We discuss two-point distortion theorems corresponding to the two-fold symmetry. New estimates are obtained for the module of a doubly connected domain. These estimates generalize known results by Rengel, Grötzsch, and Teichmüller to the case of rings with the n-fold symmetry, where \( \geqslant 2\). New distortion theorems are proved for functions meromorphic and univalent in a disk or in a ring. In these theorems, the extremal function also has the corresponding symmetry. All of the problems mentioned above are unified by the method applied; this method is based on properties of the conformal capacity and on symmetrization. Bibliography: 27 titles.",V. N.

","The ABC  lamellar phase of a triblock copolymer in the strong segregation region is studied on periodic and bounded intervals. In the periodic case we find a family of local minimizers of the free energy functional all with a fine lamellar structure. Among these local minimizers we identify the one most favored by the free energy, and hence determine the thickness of lamellar microdomains. In the bounded interval case we show that perfect lamellar structure does not exist due to the boundary effect. We view the strong segregation limit as a Γ -limit of the free energy by a proper choice of the material sample size. The key step is the spectral analysis of a large matrix resulting from the second derivative of the Γ -limit.

826,An exact duality theory for semidefinite programming and its complexity implications,"In this paper, an exact dual is derived for Semidefinite Programming (SDP), for which strong duality properties hold without any regularity assumptions. Its main features are: (i) The new dual is an explicit semidefinite program with polynomially many variables and polynomial size coefficient bitlengths. (ii) If the primal is feasible, then it is bounded if and only if the dual is feasible. (iii) When the primal is feasible and bounded, then its optimum value equals that of the dual, or in other words, there is no duality gap. Further, the dual attains this common optimum value. (iv) It yields a precise theorem of the alternative for semidefinite inequality systems, i.e. a characterization of theinfeasibility of a semidefinite inequality in terms of thefeasibility of another polynomial size semidefinite inequality.The standard duality for linear programming satisfies all of the above features, but no such explicit gap-free dual program of polynomial size was previously known for SDP, without Slater-like conditions being assumed. The dual is then applied to derive certain complexity results for SDP. The decision problem of Semidefinite Feasibility (SDFP), which asks to determine if a given semidefinite inequality system is feasible, is the central problem of interest, he complexity of SDFP is unknown, but we show the following: (i) In the Turing machine model, the membership or nonmembership of SDFP in NP and Co-NP is simultaneous; hence SDFP is not NP-Complete unless NP=Co-NP. (ii) In the real number model of Blum, Shub and Smale, SDFP is in NP∩CoNP.",Motakuri V.

829,The Kolmogorov–Obukhov Statistical Theory of Turbulence,"In 1941 Kolmogorov and Obukhov postulated the existence of a statistical theory of turbulence, which allows the computation of statistical quantities that can be simulated and measured in a turbulent system. These are quantities such as the moments, the structure functions and the probability density functions (PDFs) of the turbulent velocity field. In this paper we will outline how to construct this statistical theory from the stochastic Navier–Stokes equation. The additive noise in the stochastic Navier–Stokes equation is generic noise given by the central limit theorem and the large deviation principle. The multiplicative noise consists of jumps multiplying the velocity, modeling jumps in the velocity gradient. We first estimate the structure functions of turbulence and establish the Kolmogorov–Obukhov 1962 scaling hypothesis with the She–Leveque intermittency corrections. Then we compute the invariant measure of turbulence, writing the stochastic Navier–Stokes equation as an infinite-dimensional Ito process, and solving the linear Kolmogorov–Hopf functional differential equation for the invariant measure. Finally we project the invariant measure onto the PDF. The PDFs turn out to be the normalized inverse Gaussian (NIG) distributions of Barndorff-Nilsen, and compare well with PDFs from simulations and experiments.",Björn Birnir,Journal of Nonlinear Science,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00332-012-9164-z,"Turbulence,Inertial cascade,Kolmogorov–Obukhov scaling,Intermittency,Intermittency corrections,Invariant measure,Probability distribution function,Stochastic partial differential equations,Navier–Stokes equation,Central limit theorem,Large deviations,Feynman–Kac formula,Cameron–Martin formula,Structure functions,Log-Poisson processes,Brownian motion,Homogeneous Lévy process,Fully developed turbulence"

831,An extended version of Schur-Cohn-Fujiwara theorem in stability theory,"This paper is concerned with root localization of a complex polynomial with respect to the unit circle in the more general case. The classical Schur-Cohn-Fujiwara theorem converts the inertia problem of a polynomial to that of an appropriate Hermitian matrix under the condition that the associated Bezout matrix is nonsingular. To complete it, we discuss an extended version of the Schur-Cohn-Fujiwara theorem to the singular case of that Bezout matrix. Our method is mainly based on a perturbation technique for a Bezout matrix. As an application of these results and methods, we further obtain an explicit formula for the number of roots of a polynomial located on the upper half part of the unit circle as well.","Yongjian Hu1, Xuzhou Zhan1 & Gongning Chen",Frontiers of Mathematics in China,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11464-015-0453-3,"Inertia of polynomial,inertia of matrix,Bezout matrix,Schur-Cohn-Fujiwara theorem,Schur-Cohn matrix"

We show that the (open) set $\Omega^+\subset{\mathcal A}$ of all division algebra structures on $A$ has four connected components.

835,Semi-explicit solutions to the water-wave dispersion relation and their role in the non-linear Hamiltonian coupled-mode theory,"The Hamiltonian coupled-mode theory (HCMT), recently derived by Athanassoulis and Papoutsellis [Proceeding of 34th International Conference on Ocean Offshore Arctic Engineering, ASME, St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada, 2015], provides an efficient new approach for solving fully non-linear water-wave problems over arbitrary bathymetry. This theory exactly transforms the free-boundary problem to a fixed-boundary one, with space and time-varying coefficients. In calculating these coefficients, heavy use is made of the roots of a local, water-wave dispersion relation with varying parameters, which have to be calculated at every horizontal position and every time instant. Thus, fast and accurate calculation of these roots, valid for all possible values of the varying parameter, are of fundamental importance for the efficient implementation of HCMT. In this paper, new, semi-explicit and highly accurate root-finding formulae are derived, especially for the roots corresponding to evanescent modes. The derivation is based on the successive application of a Picard-type iteration and the Householders root-finding method. Explicit approximate formulae of very good accuracy are obtained, and machine-accurate determination of the required roots is easily achieved by no more than three iterations, using the explicit forms as initial values. Exploiting this procedure in the HCMT, results in an efficient, dimensionally reduced, numerical solver able to treat fully non-linear water waves over arbitrary bathymetry. Applications to four demanding non-linear problems demonstrate the efficiency and the robustness of the present approach. Specifically, we consider the classical tests of strongly non-linear steady wave propagation and the transformation of regular waves due to trapezoidal and sinusoidal bathymetry. Novel results are also given for the disintegration of a solitary wave due to an abrupt deepening. The derived root-finding formulae can be used with any other multimodal methods as well.","T. K.

For this reason, this paper, in terms of subdifferential, first shows a representation theorem for all finitely additive probability measures defined on the σ-algebra  of all subsets of N, and proves that every such measure can be uniquely decomposed into a convex combination of a countably additive probability measure and a statistical measure (i.e. a finitely additive probability measure μ with μ(k) = 0 for all singletons {k}). This paper also shows that classical statistical measures have many nice properties, such as: The set  of all such measures endowed with the topology of point-wise convergence on  forms a compact convex Hausdorff space; every classical statistical measure is of continuity type (hence, atomless), and every specific class of statistical measures fits a complementation minimax rule for every subset in N. Finally, this paper shows that every kind of statistical convergence can be unified in convergence of statistical measures.","LiXin Cheng1, GuoChen Lin1, YongYi Lan1 & …Hui Liu",Science in China Series A: Mathematics,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-008-0017-z,"statistical convergence,statistical measure,subdifferential,Banach space"

It is pointed out that with the all-or-none law a single chain of neurons connected in series transmits one bit of information per signal. A set ofN independent parallel chains transmitsN bits per signal. If, however, the chains are interconnected, the amount of information is reduced. At the same time, however, the degree of coordination of the final neuromuscular reaction is increased. A relation between the maximum possible speed of a reaction and its degree of coordination is derived, and possible applications to spoken language are suggested. A general quantitative discussion of the relation between amount of information and amount of knowledge which an individual may obtain when confronted with the external world is made and a possible connection with new trends in logical thinking is pointed out.In the second part transmission of information through “social chains” is discussed under certain special assumptions.

854,On tsunami and the regularized solitary-wave theory,"For ideal hydrodynamic modeling of earthquake-generated tsunamis, the principal features of tsunamis occuring in nature are abstracted to provide a fundamental case of a one-dimensional solitary wave of height a, propagating in a layer of water of uniform rest depth h for modeling the tsunami progressing in the open ocean over long range, with height down to a/h ≃ 10−4 as commonly known. The Euler model is adopted for evaluating the irrotational flow in an incompressible and inviscid fluid to attain exact solutions so that the effects of nonlinearity and wave dispersion can both be fully accounted for with maximum relative error of O(10−6) or less. Such high accuracy is needed to predict the wave-energy distribution as the wave magnifies to deliver any devastating attack on coastal destinations. The present UIFE method, successful in giving the maximum wave of height (a/h = 0.8331990) down to low ones (e.g. a/h = 0.01), becomes, however, impractical for similar evaluations of the dwarf waves (a/h < 0.01) due to the algebraic branch singularities rising too high to be accurately resolved. Here, these singularities are all removed by introducing regularized coordinates under conformal mapping to establish the regularized solitary-wave theory. This theory is ideal to differentiate between the nonlinear and dispersive effects in various premises for producing an optimal tsunami model, with new computations all regular uniformly down to such low tsunamis as that of height a/h = 10−4.",Theodore Yaotsu Wu1 & Sunao Murashige,Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-010-9423-7,"1-D tsunami wave,Conformal mapping,Dwarf solitary waves,Optimal tsunami model,Regularized coordinates,Regularized solitary-wave theory,Tsunami energy distribution"

857,A two-component theory of aerosol deposition in lung airways,"The deposition of aerosol particles in the human lung airways is due to two distinct mechanisms. One is by direct deposition resulting from diffusion, sedimentation and impaction as the aerosol moves in and out of the lung. The other is an indirect mechanism by which particles are transported mechanically from the tidal air to the residential air and eventually captured by the airways due to intrinsic particle motion. This last mechanism is not well understood at present. Using a trumpet airway model constructed from Weibel's data, a two-component theory is developed. In this theory, the particle concentrations in the airways and the alveoli at a given airway depth are considered to be quantitatively different. This difference in concentrations will cause a net mixing between the tidal and residential aerosol as the aerosol is breathed in and out. A distribution parameter is then introduced to account for the distribution of ventilation. The effect of intrinsic particle motion on the aerosol mixing is also included. From this theory, total and regional deposition in the lung at the steady mouth breathing without pause is calculated for several different respiratory cycles. The results agree reasonably well with the experimental data.",C. P.

859,Augmented intuition: a bridge between theory and practice,"Motivated by the celebrated paper of Hooker (J Heuristics 1(1): 33–42, 1995) published in the first issue of this journal, and by the relative lack of progress of both approximation algorithms and fixed-parameter algorithms for the classical decision and optimization problems related to covering edges by vertices, we aimed at developing an approach centered in augmenting our intuition about what is indeed needed. We present a case study of a novel design methodology by which algorithm weaknesses will be identified by computer-based and fixed-parameter tractable algorithmic challenges on their performance. Comprehensive benchmarkings on all instances of small size then become an integral part of the design process. Subsequent analyses of cases where human intuition “fails”, supported by computational testing, will then lead to the development of new methods by avoiding the traps of relying only on human perspicacity and ultimately will improve the quality of the results. Consequently, the computer-aided design process is seen as a tool to augment human intuition. It aims at accelerating and foster theory development in areas such as graph theory and combinatorial optimization since some safe reduction rules for pre-processing can be mathematically proved via theorems. This approach can also lead to the generation of new interesting heuristics. We test our ideas with a fundamental problem in graph theory that has attracted the attention of many researchers over decades, but for which seems it seems to be that a certain stagnation has occurred. The lessons learned are certainly beneficial, suggesting that we can bridge the increasing gap between theory and practice by a more concerted approach that would fuel human imagination from a data-driven discovery perspective.","Pablo Moscato

860,The re-examination of the weakly nonlinear theory of hydrodynamic stability,"
The weakly nonlinear theory has been widely applied in the problem of hydrodynamic stability and also in other fields. However, although its application has been successful for some problems, yet, for other problems, the results obtained are not satisfactory, especially for problems like transition or the evolution of the vortex in the free shear flow, for which the goal of the theoretical investigation is not seeking for a steady state, but predicting an evolutional process. In this paper, we shall examine the reason for the unsuccessfulness and suggest ways for its amendment.",Zhou Heng,Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,1991,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02098051,"hydrodynamic stability,weakly nonlinear theory,resonance"
861,"A Hecke-equivariant decomposition of spaces of Drinfeld cusp forms via representation theory, and an investigation of its subfactors","There are various reasons why a naive analog of the Maeda conjecture has to fail for Drinfeld cusp forms. Focussing on double cusp forms and using the link found by Teitelbaum between Drinfeld cusp forms and certain harmonic cochains, we observed a while ago that all obvious counterexamples disappear for certain Hecke-invariant subquotients of spaces of Drinfeld cusp forms of fixed weight, which can be defined naturally via representation theory. The present work extends Teitelbaum’s isomorphism to an adelic setting and to arbitrary levels, it makes precise the impact of representation theory, it relates certain intertwining maps to hyperderivatives of Bosser-Pellarin, and it begins an investigation into dimension formulas for the subquotients mentioned above. We end with some numerical data for \(A={\mathbb {F}}_3[t]\) that displays a new obstruction to an analog of a Maeda conjecture by discovering a conjecturally infinite supply of \({\mathbb {F}}_3(t)\)-rational eigenforms with combinatorially given (conjectural) Hecke eigenvalues at the prime t.","Gebhard Böckle

864,On the relationship between control theory and nonholonomic mechanics,"This paper concerns transitions of a mechanical system, in a given time, from one state, in which the generalized coordinates and velocities are given, into another one, in which the system should have the required coordinates and velocities. It is assumed that such a transition may be effected using a single control force. It is shown that if one determines the force using the Pontryagin maximum principle (from the minimality condition of the time integral of the force squared during the time of motion), then a nonholonomic high-order constraint occurs in the defined process of motion of the system. As a result, this problem can be attacked by the theory of motion of nonholonomic systems with high-order constraints. According to this theory, in the set of different motions with a constraint of the same order, the optimal motion is the one for which the generalized Gauss principle is fulfilled. Thus, a control force that is chosen from the set of forces that provide the transition of a mechanical system from one state to another during a given time can be specified both on the basis of the Pontryagin maximum principle and on the basis of the generalized Gauss principle. Particular attention is paid to the comparison of the results that are obtained by these two principles. This is illustrated using the example of a horizontal motion of a pendula cart system to which a required force is applied. To obtain the control force without jumps at the beginning and the end of the motion, an extended boundary problem is formulated in which not only the coordinates and velocities are given at these times, but also the derivatives of the coordinates with respect to time up to the order n ≥ 2. This extended boundary-value problem cannot be solved via the Pontryagin maximum principle, because in this case the number of arbitrary constants will be smaller than the total number of the boundary-value conditions. At the same time, the generalized Gauss principle is capable of solving the problem, because in this case it is only required to increase the order of the principle to a value that agrees with the number of given boundary-value conditions. The results of numerical calculations are presented.","M. P. Yushkov1, S. A. Zegzhda1, Sh. Kh. Soltakhanov2 & …A. A.

As an application of the new theory, we present full statements of the iterated contraction principle and the Banach contraction principle in cone metric spaces over a solid vector space. We propose a new approach to such cone metric spaces. We introduce a new notion of strict vector ordering, which is quite natural and it is easy to use in the cone metric theory and its applications to the fixed point theory. This notion plays the main role in the new theory. Among the other results in this paper, the following is perhaps of most interest. Every ordered vector space with convergence can be equipped with a strict vector ordering if and only if it is a solid vector space. Moreover, if the positive cone of an ordered vector space with convergence is solid, then there exists only one strict vector ordering on this space. Also, in this paper we present some useful properties of cone metric spaces, which allow us to establish convergence results for Picard iteration with a priori and a posteriori error estimates.MSC: 54H25, 47H10, 46A19, 65J15, 06F30.",Petko.

872,A mathematical theory of enamel solubility and the onset of dental caries: III. Development and computer simulation of a model of caries formation,"Part III attempts to develop a diffusion controlled model of caries in the intact enamel employing the kinetic results of the previous two parts. A model of the enamel as a granular bed with a diffusible organic matrix filling the interstices is considered. The basic equations of diffusion and simultaneous reaction are developed under the assumption that all the reactions are so rapid as compared with the diffusion rate, that they are in a quasi-equilibrium state. The resultant system of seven coupled, non-linear parabolic partial differential equations is of such complexity that only numerical solutions could be attempted. Stability restrictions inherent in the problem dictated the use of the DuFort-Frankel numerical solution for parabolic boundary problems. Numerical solutions giving the concentration of all reactants, the rate of mineral loss, and the enamel porosity were obtained for a variety of boundary conditions. It is found that departure from the equilibrium condition expressed in part II is necessary for the occurrence of an attack on the enamel. The rate and pattern of penetration is then determined primarily by the concentrations of undissociated buffer, and salts, together with the rate of diffusion in the surrounding medium. The possibility of a relatively intact surface layer persisting over a demineralized subsurface region due solely to the composition of the demineralizing medium is noted. Remineralization behavior in portions of the carious lesion occurs in the model under certain boundary conditions.",Stuart O.

By following arrows, one can then construct a natural Floer-type boundary operator. Here, we develop such a construction for arrow patterns where each cell may support several outgoing or incoming arrows (but not both), again in the absence of closed orbits. Our main technical achievement is the construction of a boundary operator that squares to 0 and therefore recovers the homology of the underlying complex.

879,The Mutation Process in Colored Coalescent Theory,"The mutation process is introduced into the colored coalescent theory. The mutation process can be viewed as an independent Poisson process running on the colored genealogical random tree generated by the colored coalescent process, with the edge lengths of the random tree serving as the time scale for the mutation process. Moving backward along the colored genealogical tree, the color of vertices may change in two ways, when two vertices coalesce, or when a mutation happens. The rule that governs the coalescent change of color involves a parameter x; the rule that governs the mutation involves a parameter μ. Explicit computations of the expectation of the coalescent time (the first hitting time), and the coalescent probabilities (the first hitting probabilities) are carried out. For example, our calculation shows that when x=1/2, for a sample of n colored individuals, the expected time for the colored coalescent process with the mutation process superimposed to first reach a black MRCA or a white MRCA, respectively, is 3−2/n with probability 1/2 for any value of the parameter μ. On the other hand, the expected time for the colored coalescent process with mutation to first reach a MRCA, either black or white, is 2−2/n for any values of the parameters μ and x, which is the same as that for the standard Kingman coalescent process.",Jianjun Paul Tian1 & Xiao-Song Lin,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-009-9428-4,"Coalescent theory,Colored coalescent process,Mutation process,Lumped process,Colored random tree"
880,A convergence theory for an overlapping Schwarz algorithm using discontinuous iterates,"A new type of overlapping Schwarz methods, using discontinuous iterates, is constructed by modifying the classical overlapping Schwarz algorithm. This new algorithm allows for discontinuous iterates across the artificial interface. For Poisson’s equation, this algorithm can be considered as an overlapping version of Lions’ Robin iteration method for which little is known concerning the rate of convergence. Since overlap improves the performance of the classical algorithms considerably, the existence of a uniform convergence factor is the fundamental question for our algorithm. A new theory using Lagrange multipliers is developed and conditions are found for the existence of an almost uniform convergence factor for the dual variables, which implies rapid convergence of the primal variables, in the two overlapping subdomain case. Our result also shows a relation between the boundary conditions of the given problem and the artificial interface condition. Numerical results for the general case with cross points are also presented. They indicate possible extensions of our results to this more general case.",Jung-Han Kimn,Numerische Mathematik,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-004-0572-3,"Boundary Condition,Mathematical Method,Lagrange Multiplier,Iteration Method,Fundamental Question"

It presents a review of some results obtained during the last decade in problems related to the dynamics of branch and self-similar groups on the boundary of a spherically homogeneous rooted tree and to the combinatorics and asymptotic properties of Schreier graphs associated with a group or with its action. Special emphasis is placed on the study of essentially free actions of selfsimilar groups, which are antipodes to branch actions. At the same time, the theme “free versus nonfree” runs through the paper. Sufficient conditions are obtained for the essential freeness of an action of a self-similar group on the boundary of a tree. Specific examples of such actions are given. Constructions of the associated dynamical system and the Schreier dynamical system generated by a Schreier graph are presented. For groups acting on trees, a trace on the associated C*-algebra generated by a Koopman representation is introduced, and its role in the study of von Neumann factors, the spectral properties of groups, Schreier graphs, and elements of the associated C*-algebra is demonstrated. The concepts of asymptotic expander and asymptotic Ramanujan graph are introduced, and examples of such graphs are given. Questions related to the notion of the cost of action and the notion of rank gradient are discussed.","R. I.

The salient feature in the energy equation is accounted due to the implementation of the Cattaneo-Christov heat flux. A liquid with variable thermal conductivity is considered in the Darcy-Forchheimer porous space. The mathematical expressions of momentum and energy are coupled due to the presence of mixed convection. A highly nonlinear coupled system of equations is tackled with the homotopic algorithm. The convergence of the homotopy expressions is calculated graphically and numerically. The solutions of the velocity and temperature are expressed for various values of the Deborah number, the ratio of the relaxation time to the retardation time, the porosity parameter, the mixed convective parameter, the Darcy-Forchheimer parameter, and the conductivity parameter. The results show that the velocity and temperature are higher in Fourier’s law of heat conduction cases in comparison with the Cattaneo-Christov heat flux model.","M. A. Meraj1, S. A. Shehzad1, T.

In this article, a new lower bounding procedure is proposed for simplicial methods yielding considerably better bounds at the expense of two linear programs in each iteration. Moreover, the resulting approach can solve easily linearly constrained problems, since in this case infeasible partition sets are automatically detected by the lower bounding procedure.Finally, it is shown that the lower bounds can be further improved when the method is applied to solve systems of inequalities.

The method utilizes a Schwartz-Christoffel transformation, the temporal flow development being calculated to yield vortex positions, pressures and overall forces on the vessel hull. The effect of the velocity term in Bernoulli's equation on hull forces is calculated by integrating pressure and confirmed using the Blasius formula. A functional form of the vortex-induced moment amplitude is deduced from the theory and applied to a frequency-domain equation of roll motion for the vessel. Comparison of theory with test data indicates that the vortex-shedding theory does predict the effects of this phenomenon on the roll motions of a specific hull shape.

906,Variational Interpolation of Functionals in Transport Theory Inverse Problems,"It is known that dual representation of problems (through the main function and its adjoint in the Lagrange sense) makes it possible to formulate an effective perturbation theory on which the successive approximation method in the inverse problem theory relies. Let us suppose that according to preliminary predictions, a solution to the inverse problem (for example, the structure of medium of interest) belongs to a certain set A. Then selecting a suitable (trial, reference) element a0 as an unperturbed one and applying the perturbation theory, one can approximately describe the behavior of a solution to the forward problem in this domain and find a subset A0 that matches the measurement data best. However, as the accuracy requirements increase, the domain of applicability of the first approximation A0 is rapidly narrowing, and its expansion via addition of higher terms of the expansion complicates the solving procedure. For this reason, a number of works have searched for unperturbed approaches, including the method of variational interpolation (VI method). In this method, not one but several reference problems a1, a2,...,an are selected, from which a linear superposition of the principal function and the adjoint one is constructed, followed by determination of coefficients from the condition of stationarity of the form of the desired functional representation.

911,On the theory of diffusion of electrolytes,"In the theory of diffusion of electrolytes the following assumptions are frequently made: (i) the electrolytic solution is electrically neutral everywhere, (ii) the ionic concentrations and the electric potential all depend on a single Cartesian coordinate as the only space variable. Often the electric potential of the solution is determined on the basis of the Poisson equation alone, disregarding any other relation between this potential and the ionic concentrations. Since the Poisson equation only represents a condition which the potential fulfills, the use of this equation alone may lead to error unless the explicit relation for the potential involving a space integration of ionic concentrations is also taken into account. But if this relation is used the Poisson equation becomes redundant and, more important, assumptions (i) and (ii) appear unacceptable, the former because it leads to a zero electric potential everywhere, the latter because it is mathematically incorrect. The present paper is based on general equations of diffusion of ions, excluding the Poisson equation. These equations form a system of nonlinear integrodifferential quations whose number equals the number of ionic species present in the solution. It appears that when all ions are distributed symmetrically around a point all functions related to the above system of equations can be made dependent on a single space coordinate: the distance from the center of symmetry. Two methods of successive approximations are given for the solution of the equations in the case of spherical symmetry with limitation to the steady state. These methods are then applied to the study of the distribution of ionic concentrations and electrical potentials inside a cell of spherical shape in equilibrium with its surroundings. These methods are rapidly convergent; exact theoretical values of the electric potential are calculable on the boundary of the cell. It appears that the potential at the center of the cell is not more than ∼50% higher than at its boundary and that variation of concentration inside the cell is not very large. For instance, with 100 mV on the boundary the ionic concentration there is about four times higher than at the center. Calculations show that extremely small amounts of electricity are sufficient to account for the electric potentials currently observed. In a cell of 100 micra diameter an average concentration of only 10−14 mole/cm3 of a monovalent ion would be sufficient to give 1 millivolt on the boundary. This concentration is directly proportional to the voltage and inversely proportional to the square of the cell diameter. Most of the numerical results given above are obtained by considering only those ions whose electrical charge is not compensated for by ions of an opposite sign. The total concentrations may be much higher than those quoted. The theory does not take into account possible effects of structural heterogeneities which may exist in the cell, particularly of various phase boundaries. An incidental result shows that the Boltzmann distribution function in the form employed in modern theory of electrolytes is fundamentally a consequence of the mathematical theory of diffusion alone. It is pointed out, however, that Boltzmann distribution is not always compatible with the definition of the electric potential.",I.

4 Spaces","The Lagrangian formalism for tensor fields over differentiable manifolds with contravariant and covariant affine connections (whose components differ not only by sign) and a metric \([(\bar L_n ,g) - spaces]\) is considered. The functional, the Lie, the covariant, and the total variations of a Lagrangian density, depending on components of tensor fields (with finite rank) and their first and second covariant derivatives, are established. A variation operator is determined and the corollaries of its commutation relations with the covariant and the Lie differential operators are found. The canonical (common) method of Lagrangians with partial derivatives (MLPD) and the method of Lagrangians with covariant derivatives (MLCD) are outlined. They differ each other by the commutation relations the variation operator has to obey with the covariant and the Lie differential operator. The covariant Euler–Lagrange equations are found on the basis of the MLCD. The energy-momentum tensors are considered on the basis of the Lie variation and the covariant Noether identities.As an application of the investigated general scheme, (pseudo) Riemannian spaces with contravariant and covariant affine connections (whose components differ not only by sign) \((\overline {V_n } {\text{ - }}spaces)\) are considered as a special case of \((\overline L _n ,g)\)-spaces with Riemannian metric, symmetric covariant connection and a weaker definition of dual vector basis with ‘conformal’ noncanonical contraction operator \(S({\text{d}}x^i ,\partial _j ) = {\text{d}}x^i (\partial _j ) = {\text{e}}^{\varphi (x)} \cdot g_j^i \).

In this article, we first introduce this class of splittings and then discuss the convergence theory for these sub-classes of matrices. We then obtain the comparison results for two double splittings of a K-monotone matrix. Most of these results are completely new even for \(K = \mathbb{R}_ + ^n\). The convergence behavior is discussed by performing numerical experiments for different matrices derived from the discretized Poisson equation.","Vaibhav Shekhar1, Nachiketa Mishra2 & Debasisha Mishra",Applications of Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.21136/AM.2021.0270-20,"linear system,iterative method,

926,Tri-directional Scheduling Scheme: Theory and Computation,"In this paper we introduce a new scheduling scheme based on so called tri-directional scheduling strategy to solve the well known resource constrained project scheduling problem. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of tri-directional scheduling scheme, it is incorporated into a priority rule based parallel scheduling scheme. Theoretical and numerical investigations show that the tri-directional scheduling scheme outperforms forward, backward and even bidirectional schemes depending on the problem structure and the priority rule used. Based on empirical evidence, it seems that as the number of activities are increased, the tri-directional scheduling scheme performs better irrespective of the priority rule used. This suggests that tri-directional scheme should also be applied within the category of heuristic methods.","H. R. Yoosefzadeh1, Hamed R. Tareghian1 & M. H.

927,Application of fixed point theory to chaotic attractors of forced oscillators,"A review of the structure of chaotic attractors of periodically forced second-order nonlinear oscillators suggests that the theory of fixed points of transformations gives information about the fundamental topological structure of attractors. First a simple extension of the Levinson index formula is proved. Then numerical evidence is used to formulate plausible conjectures about absorbing regions containing chaotic attractors in forced oscillators. Applying the Levinson formula suggests a fundamental relation between the number of fixed points or periodic points in a section of the chaotic attractor on the one hand, and a topological invariant of an absorbing region on the other hand.",H.

928,Theory of cation-phospholipid-induced shape changes in a lipid bilayer couple,"A quantitative model of ion binding and molecular interactions in the lipid bilayer membrane is proposed and found to be useful in examining the factors underlying such membrane characteristics as shape, sidedness, stability and vesicle size at various cation concentrations. The lipid membrane behaves as a bilayer couple whose preferential radius of curvature depends on the expansion or contraction of one monolayer relative to the other. It is proposed that molecular packing may be altered by electrostatic repulsion of adjacent like-charged phospholipid headgroups, or by bringing two headgroups closer together by divalent cation crossbridging. The surface concentrations of each type of cation-phospholipid complex can be described by simple binding equilibria and the Gouy-Chapman-Stern formulation for the surface potential in a diffuse double layer. The asymmetric distribution of acidic phospholipids in most biological membranes can account for the differential effects of identical ionic environments on either side of the bilayer. The fraction of vesicle material which tends to have a right-side-out orientation may be approximated by a normal distribution about the mean curvature. The theory generates vesicle sidedness distributions that, when fitted to experimental results from human erythrocyte membranes, provide an alternative method of estimating intrinsic cationphospholipid dissociation constants and other molecular parameters of the bilayer. The results also corroborate earlier suggestions that the Gouy-Chapman theory tends to overestimate free counter-ion concentrations at the surface under large surface potentials.",Gregory S. B.

929,From Koopman–von Neumann theory to quantum theory,"Koopman and von Neumann (KvN) extended the Liouville equation by introducing a phase space function \(S^{(K)}(q,p,t)\) whose physical meaning is unknown. We show that a different S(q, p, t), with well-defined physical meaning, may be introduced without destroying the attractive “quantum-like” mathematical features of the KvN theory. This new S(q, p, t) is the classical action expressed in phase space coordinates. It defines a mapping between observables and operators which preserves the Lie bracket structure. The new evolution equation reduces to Schrödinger’s equation if functions on phase space are reduced to functions on configuration space. This new kind of “quantization” does not only establish a correspondence between observables and operators, but provides in addition a derivation of quantum operators and evolution equations from corresponding classical entities. It is performed by replacing \(\frac{\partial }{\partial p}\) by 0 and p by \(\frac{\hbar }{\imath } \frac{\partial }{\partial q}\), thus providing an explanation for the common quantization rules.","U.

930,"Towards a general theory of bond markets 
","The main purpose of the paper is to provide a mathematical background for the theory of bond markets similar to that available for stock markets. We suggest two constructions of stochastic integrals with respect to processes taking values in a space of continuous functions. Such integrals are used to define the evolution of the value of a portfolio of bonds corresponding to a trading strategy which is a measure-valued predictable process. The existence of an equivalent martingale measure is discussed and HJM-type conditions are derived for a jump-diffusion model. The question of market completeness is considered as a problem of the range of a certain integral operator. We introduce a concept of approximate market completeness and show that a market is approximately complete iff an equivalent martingale measure is unique.

931,Some results in graph theory and their application to abstract relational biology,"It has been shown in earlier work that one approach to what Rashevsky has called “abstract biology” is through the study of the class of (\(\mathfrak{M}, \Re \))-systems that can be formed in an arbitrary subcategory of the category of sets. The concept of the (\(\mathfrak{M}, \Re \))-system, however, depends on the availability of mappings that contain other mappings in their range. It is shown that, by introducing an appropriate measure for this property, the problem of characterizing those categories suitable for a rich theory of (\(\mathfrak{M}, \Re \))-systems reduces to a problem familiar from the general theory of graphs. Some new results in these directions are obtained, and it is then shown that any category with mappings that possess properties we might expect to hold in the physical world will also admit a rich theory of (\(\mathfrak{M}, \Re \))-systems. In particular, it is shown that a sufficiently large family of mappings drawn at random from such a category will with overwhelming probability contain an (\(\mathfrak{M}, \Re \))-system.",Robert Rosen,The bulletin of mathematical biophysics,1963,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02478280,"Factorial Restriction,Multivalued Function,Effective Process,Finite Union,Rich Theory"

1 and f
2 from the sphere S
m to an n-manifold N, when are they loose, i.e. when can they be deformed away from one another? We study the geometry of their (generic) coincidence locus and its Nielsen decomposition. On the one hand, the resulting bordism class of coincidence data and the corresponding Nielsen numbers are strong looseness obstructions. On the other hand, the values which these invariants may possibly assume turn out to satisfy severe restrictions, e.g. the Nielsen numbers can only take the values 0, 1 or the cardinality of the fundamental group of N. In order to show this we compare different Nielsen classes in the root case (where f
1 or f
2 is constant) and we use the fact that all but possibly one Nielsen class are inessential in the selfcoincidence case (where f
1 = f

934,Multivariate phase-type theory for the site frequency spectrum,"Linear functions of the site frequency spectrum (SFS) play a major role for understanding and investigating genetic diversity. Estimators of the mutation rate (e.g. based on the total number of segregating sites or average of the pairwise differences) and tests for neutrality (e.g. Tajima’s D) are perhaps the most well-known examples. The distribution of linear functions of the SFS is important for constructing confidence intervals for the estimators, and to determine significance thresholds for neutrality tests. These distributions are often approximated using simulation procedures. In this paper we use multivariate phase-type theory to specify, characterize and calculate the distribution of linear functions of the site frequency spectrum. In particular, we show that many of the classical estimators of the mutation rate are distributed according to a discrete phase-type distribution. Neutrality tests, however, are generally not discrete phase-type distributed. For neutrality tests we derive the probability generating function using continuous multivariate phase-type theory, and numerically invert the function to obtain the distribution. A main result is an analytically tractable formula for the probability generating function of the SFS. Software implementation of the phase-type methodology is available in the R package PhaseTypeR, and R code for the reproduction of our results is available as an accompanying vignette.","Asger Hobolth

935,The Design Evaluation of the Green Space Layout of Urban Squares Based on Fractal Theory,"Many scholars have applied fractal geometry to analyze non–linear urban forms at the regional, city, and building levels. However, little attention has been given to the level of urban design. The aim of this paper is to test the validity of fractal analysis on the green space layout of urban squares. Four research cases – including one in USA, one in Argentina, and two in China – are analyzed usingBovill’s box–counting method. We find that continuous hierarchical scales are essential to the fractal nature of the built environment, and the scales derived from the human–scale theories of open space are used to develop the box sizes. The authors demonstrate the advantage of using calculation charts to provide direct visual insights into the fractal distribution of the layout, through lacunas and shadowed boxes. The significance of new lacunas is presented and discussed in particular. The proposed method allows for quantitative measures, convenient evaluation, and potential feedback to improve the fractal quality of the green space design.","Jiang Liang1, Yanqin Hu1 & Hui Sun",Nexus Network Journal,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00004-012-0135-3,"green space layout,urban square,fractal,hierarchical scale,design evaluation"

Next we consider the group \(\mathrm {Symp}(X, L)\) of symplectomorphisms of X preserving L setwise, and extend its action on the Oh spectral sequence to coefficients of arbitrary characteristic, incorporating its action on the classes of holomorphic discs. This imposes constraints on the differentials which force them to vanish in certain situations.

It is the asymptotic treatment of the stability problem that has a rational basis, since it is in the limit of high Reynolds numbers that the basic flow has the form of a boundary layer. The principles for constructing a boundary layer stability theory based on the triple-deck theory are proposed. Although most attention is focused on transonic outer flows, a comparative analysis with the asymptotic theory of boundary layer stability in subsonic flows is given. The parameters of internal waves near the lower branch of the neutral curve are associated with a certain perturbation field pattern. These parameters satisfy dispersion relations derived by solving eigenvalue problems. The dispersion relations are investigated in complex planes.","A. N. Bogdanov1, V. N. Diesperov1, V. I.

context. Rota’s work falls under three specific cases: vector invariants, the invariants of
binary forms, and the invariants of skew-symmetric tensors. We discuss each of these cases
and show how determinants and straightening play central roles. In fact, determinants
constitute all invariants in the vector case; for binary forms and skew-symmetric tensors,
they constitute all invariants when invariants are represented symbolically. Consequently,
we explain the symbolic method both for binary forms and for skew-symmetric tensors,
where Rota developed generalizations of the usual notion of a determinant. We also discuss
the Grassmann algebra, with its two operations of meet and join, which was a theme which
ran through Rota’s work on invariant theory almost from the very beginning.",Frank D. Grosshans,algebra universalis,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00012-003-1827-z,"13A50, 15A15, 15A72, 15A75"

942,Rotational flow of Oldroyd-B nanofluid subject to Cattaneo-Christov double diffusion theory,"A nanofluid is composed of a base fluid component and nanoparticles, in which the nanoparticles are dispersed in the base fluid. The addition of nanoparticles into a base fluid can remarkably improve the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid, and such an increment of thermal conductivity can play an important role in improving the heat transfer rate of the base fluid. Further, the dynamics of non-Newtonian fluids along with nanoparticles is quite interesting with numerous industrial applications. The present predominately predictive modeling studies the flow of the viscoelastic Oldroyd-B fluid over a rotating disk in the presence of nanoparticles. A progressive amendment in the heat and concentration equations is made by exploiting the Cattaneo-Christov heat and mass flux expressions. The characteristic of the Lorentz force due to the magnetic field applied normal to the disk is studied. The Buongiorno model together with the Cattaneo-Christov theory is implemented in the Oldroyd-B nanofluid flow to investigate the heat and mass transport mechanism. This theory predicts the characteristics of the fluid thermal and solutal relaxation time on the boundary layer flow. The von Kármán similarity functions are utilized to convert the partial differential equations (PDEs) into ordinary differential equations (ODEs). A homotopic approach for obtaining the analytical solutions to the governing nonlinear problem is carried out. The graphical results are obtained for the velocity field, temperature, and concentration distributions. Comparisons are made for a limiting case between the numerical and analytical solutions, and the results are found in good agreement. The results reveal that the thermal and solutal relaxation time parameters diminish the temperature and concentration distributions, respectively. The axial flow decreases in the downward direction for higher values of the retardation time parameter. The impact of the thermophoresis parameter boosts the temperature distribution.","A.

952,"Mean Curvature, Threshold Dynamics, and Phase Field Theory on Finite Graphs","In the continuum, close connections exist between mean curvature flow, the Allen-Cahn (AC) partial differential equation, and the Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) threshold dynamics scheme. Graph analogues of these processes have recently seen a rise in popularity as relaxations of NP-complete combinatorial problems, which demands deeper theoretical underpinnings of the graph processes. The aim of this paper is to introduce these graph processes in the light of their continuum counterparts, provide some background, prove the first results connecting them, illustrate these processes with examples and identify open questions for future study.We derive a graph curvature from the graph cut function, the natural graph counterpart of total variation (perimeter). This derivation and the resulting curvature definition differ from those in earlier literature, where the continuum mean curvature is simply discretized, and bears many similarities to the continuum nonlocal curvature or nonlocal means formulation. This new graph curvature is not only relevant for graph MBO dynamics, but also appears in the variational formulation of a discrete time graph mean curvature flow.We prove estimates showing that the dynamics are trivial for both MBO and AC evolutions if the parameters (the time-step and diffuse interface scale, respectively) are sufficiently small (a phenomenon known as “freezing” or “pinning”) and also that the dynamics for MBO are nontrivial if the time step is large enough. These bounds are in terms of graph quantities such as the spectrum of the graph Laplacian and the graph curvature. Adapting a Lyapunov functional for the continuum MBO scheme to graphs, we prove that the graph MBO scheme converges to a stationary state in a finite number of iterations. Variations on this scheme have recently become popular in the literature as ways to minimize (continuum) nonlocal total variation.","Yves van Gennip1, Nestor Guillen2, Braxton Osting2 & …Andrea L.

958,Theory of generalized discrepancies on a ball of arbitrary finite dimensions and algorithms for finding low-discrepancy point sets,"One of the objectives of this paper is to extend the idea of the generalized discrepancy to the ball of arbitrary finite dimensions and to study its properties. We first construct orthonormal systems in higher dimensions, Sobolev spaces as well as particular differential operators. The discrepancy is then derived from an error estimate for numerical integration on a ball. We also present some new statistical and numerical properties of the generalized discrepancy which have also been unknown in three dimensions before. In addition, this paper focuses on constructing and implementing novel algorithms in order to obtain low-discrepancy point grids on the ball. Such low-discrepancy grids are uniformly distributed and are appropriate for quadrature rules (sometimes also called cubature rules) and as centres of localized trial functions in tomographic inverse problems on the ball. For this purpose, we also consider the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm and examine different BFGS updates and line search methods.

The pencil-arithmetic operations extend elementary formulas for sums and products of rational numbers and include the algebra of linear transformations as a special case. These operations give an unusual perspective on a variety of pencil related computations. We derive generalizations of monodromy matrices and the matrix exponential. A new algorithm for computing a pencil-arithmetic generalization of the matrix sign function does not use matrix inverses and gives an empirically forward numerically stable algorithm for extracting deflating subspaces.,Peter Benner1 & Ralph Byers,Numerische Mathematik,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-006-0001-x,"Matrix Relation,Full Column Rank,Algebraic Riccati Equation,Matrix Pencil,IEEE Trans Automat Control"
961,On the index theory of Pseudo-Caratheodory functions. Application to the linear system stability problem,"This paper is concerned with the index theory of Carathéodory functions and more precisely with the index properties of these functions which can be exploited for the actual determination of their index. The rational pseudo-lossless functionsf(z), defined from the identity\(f(z) + \bar f(1/\bar z) = 0\), constitute an interesting subclass of pseudo-Carathéodory functions; the index determination problem for these particular functions appear to be equivalent to the polynomial zeros location problem. Various decomposition techniques are described for the index computation of rational pseudo-lossless functions. It turns out that most known tests to count the zeros of a polynomial in standard regions of the plane (unit disk or right half-plane) can be viewed as particular applications of the techniques above. As a result, the index theory of pseudo-lossless functions appears as an alternative, elegant and simple way to derive these tests directly in their full generality.",Yves Genin,Integral Equations and Operator Theory,1987,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01195795,"Linear System,Unit Disk,Location Problem,System Stability,Stability Problem"
962,Bridging game theory and the knapsack problem: a theoretical formulation,"This paper presents an approach to solving the knapsack problem in which the solution can be derived based on a treatment of the classical bargaining problem. In spatial game theory, all the players form an \(n\)-polyhedron in space, and the bargaining set of items is positioned such that the geometrical distance of each item from every player reference vertex point is inversely proportional to its utility to the player. The game-theoretical-based distance of an item to a player is defined as the ratio of the geometrical distance referenced from the player’s vertex position to the sum of distances from all the \(n\)-player vertices of the polyhedron, and its game moment is derived from the product of utility and this distance. Pareto optimality can then be achieved by balancing the effective game-moment contributions from \(n\)-player subsets of items at equilibrium. The Pareto-optimal solution is defined such that for a given set of consolidated items, further addition of items to the knapsack will result in diminishing returns in their payoffs or profits attained together with the corresponding unwanted increases in constraints or burdens to cause destabilization of this equilibrium. This game-theoretical approach is employed by having the game player entities work cooperatively to maximize profit and minimize burdens in order to arrive at a solution and is the first spatial game representation of the knapsack problem.","Kelvin Kian Loong Wong1,",Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-014-9742-1,"Game theory,Knapsack problem,Non-zero-sum game ,Pareto-optimal solution,Optimization"
963,A pure quantum mechanical theory of parity effect in tunneling and evolution of spins,"In recent years, the spin parity effect in magnetic macroscopic quantum tunneling has attracted extensive attention. Using the spin coherent-state path-integral method it is shown that if the HamiltonianH of a single-spin system hasM - fold rotational symmetry around z-axis, the tunneling amplitude 〈−S|eHt|S〉 vanishes when S, the quantum number of spin, is not an integer multiple ofM/2, where |m〉 (m=-S, -S +1, ⋯, S) are the eigenstates of Sz. Not only is a pure quantum mechanical approach adopted to the above result, but also is extended to more general cases where the quantum system consists ofN spins, the quantum numbers of which can take any values, including the single-spin system, ferromagnetic particle and antiferromagnetic particle as particular instances, and where the states involved are not limited to the extreme ones. The extended spin parity effect is that if the Hamiltonian ℋ of the system ofN spins also has the above symmetry, then 〈m′N⋯m′2

A surrounding elastic medium is simulated by the Pasternak foundation that considers both shear and normal loads. The sandwich nanoplate (SNP) consists of a core that is made of metal and two MEE layers on the upper and lower surfaces of the core made of BaTiO3/CoFe2O4. The refined zigzag theory (RZT) is used to model the SNP subject to both external electric and magnetic potentials. Using an energy method and Hamilton’s principle, the governing motion equations are obtained, and then solved analytically. A detailed parametric study is conducted, concentrating on the combined effects of the small scale parameter, external electric and magnetic loads, thicknesses of MEE layers, mode numbers, and surrounding elastic medium. It is concluded that increasing the small scale parameter decreases the critical buckling loads.","A. Ghorbanpour-Arani1,2, F. Kolahdouzan1 & M.

We also provide estimates, in terms of the physical parameters of the equations, for the Hausdorff and fractal dimensions of their global attractor. In analogy with the Kolmogorov theory of turbulence, we define a small spatial scale, ℓ
∈
, as the scale at which the balance occurs in the mean rates of nonlinear transport of energy and viscous dissipation of energy. Furthermore, we show that the number of degrees of freedom in the long-time behavior of the solutions to these equations is bounded from above by (L/ℓ
∈
)3, where L is a typical large spatial scale (e.g., the size of the domain). This estimate suggests that the Landau–Lifshitz classical theory of turbulence is suitable for interpreting the solutions of the NS-α equations. Hence, one may consider these equations as a closure model for the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations (NSE). We study this approach, further, in other related papers. Finally, we discuss the relation of the NS-α model to the NSE by proving a convergence theorem, that as the length scale α
1 tends to zero a subsequence of solutions of the NS-α equations converges to a weak solution of the three dimensional NSE.","Ciprian Foias1,2, Darryl D. Holm3 & Edriss S.

In contrast to physics which has a long history and experience in collaborative projects, biology is only recently becoming an evermore collaborative discipline. In this article we explore the effect of a collaboration network on the distribution of players having access to certain amount of resources from other players in the network and the distribution of the strength of interactions among them. We are interested in how they affect each other in the context of a network of scientific collaboration under the idea that while researchers are interested in maximizing their utilities, they also know that it is important to invest in building collaborative relationships.MethodsWe implemented two games played simultaneously: one for maximizing individual utility based on the iterated prisoner’s dilemma; the other, a coordination game for maximizing the connection strength between players. We tested our simulation on a biomedical research community network in México and compared the results with Erdös–Renyí, a Watts–Strogatz small-world and Barabási–Albert topologies.ResultsDifferent topologies display different global utility and global strength of interaction distributions. Moreover, the distribution of utility and strength of interaction in the researchers network is similar to that of Barabási–Albert and Watts–Strogatz topologies, respectively.ConclusionsData related to Science, from co-authorships to Scientists' movility are increasingly becoming available.

In order to matching P2P logical overlay network with physical topology, the position-based topology has been proposed. The proposed topology not only focuses on non-functional characteristics such as scalability, reliability, fault-tolerance, self-organization, decentralization and fairness, but also functional characteristics are addressed as well. The experimental results show that the hybrid complex topology achieves better characteristics than other complex networks’ models like small-world and scale-free models; since most of the real-life networks are both scale-free and small-world networks, it may perform well in mimicking the reality. Meanwhile, it reveals that the authors improve average distance, diameter and clustering coefficient versus Chord and CAN topologies.

On the basis of these considerations, a number of results are proved, including the possibility of selecting a unique representative (a “canonical form”) from a family of mathematical objects, all of which represent the same system.

An ideal geometry of the tissue is assumed, based to some extent on recent anatomical work concerning the functional distinction between two types of capillaries, the arteriolo-venular and the true capillaries. Equations are developed relating the concentration in the arterial blood to the mean capillary concentration, the concentration at the wall of the capillary in the extracellular space, and the average concentration in the extracellular space, and also relating the cellular concentration to the average extracellular concentration. The solutions of the equations are given for certain special cases and numerical results obtained. It is shown that the average extracellular concentration is a sensitive function of the permeability of the capillary wall and also is strongly influenced by the diffusion coefficient of the extracellular space. Furthermore, it is shown that the speed with which the average extracellular concentration approaches the steady state is largely a function of the permeability of the capillary wall.",George W.

A model is presented to maximize the probability of all constraints, while not exceeding a certain amount. We assume that the rows of the constraint matrix are dependent, so we use a marginal distribution of the Copula functions, instead of the distribution functions and the dependency is driven by an appropriate Archimedean Copula. Then, we transform the joint chance-constrained problems into deterministic problems of second-order cone programming. This is a new approach where considers the dependency between resource consumptions and connects Copulas to stochastic resource constrained shortest path problem (SRCSPP). The results indicate that the effect of marginal probability levels is considerable. Moreover, the linear relaxation of SRCSPP is generally not convex; thus we can use lower and upper bounds of the second-order cone programming approximation to solve the relaxation problem. The experimental results show that the SRCSPP with Copula theory can achieve efficient performance.","Zohreh Hosseini Nodeh1, Ali Babapour Azar1, Rashed Khanjani Shiraz1, Salman Khodayifar2 & …Panos M.

998,Lifschitz realizability for intuitionistic Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory,"A variant of realizability for Heyting arithmetic which validates Church’s thesis with uniqueness condition, but not the general form of Church’s thesis, was introduced by Lifschitz (Proc Am Math Soc 73:101–106, 1979). A Lifschitz counterpart to Kleene’s realizability for functions (in Baire space) was developed by van Oosten (J Symb Log 55:805–821, 1990). In that paper he also extended Lifschitz’ realizability to second order arithmetic. The objective here is to extend it to full intuitionistic Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, IZF. The machinery would also work for extensions of IZF with large set axioms. In addition to separating Church’s thesis with uniqueness condition from its general form in intuitionistic set theory, we also obtain several interesting corollaries. The interpretation repudiates a weak form of countable choice, AC

ω,ω
, asserting that a countable family of inhabited sets of natural numbers has a choice function. AC

ω,ω
 is validated by ordinary Kleene realizability and is of course provable in ZF. On the other hand, a pivotal consequence of AC

ω,ω

1014,On numerical optimization theory of infinite kernel learning,"In Machine Learning algorithms, one of the crucial issues is the representation of the data. As the given data source become heterogeneous and the data are large-scale, multiple kernel methods help to classify “nonlinear data”. Nevertheless, the finite combinations of kernels are limited up to a finite choice. In order to overcome this discrepancy, a novel method of  “infinite”  kernel combinations is proposed with the help of infinite and semi-infinite programming regarding all elements in kernel space. Looking at all infinitesimally fine convex combinations of the kernels from the infinite kernel set, the margin is maximized subject to an infinite number of constraints with a compact index set and an additional (Riemann–Stieltjes) integral constraint due to the combinations. After a parametrization in the space of probability measures, it becomes semi-infinite. We adapt well-known numerical methods to our infinite kernel learning model and analyze the existence of solutions and convergence for the given algorithms. We implement our new algorithm called “infinite” kernel learning (IKL) on heterogenous data sets by using exchange method and conceptual reduction method, which are well known numerical techniques from solve semi-infinite programming. The results show that our IKL approach improves the classifaction accuracy efficiently on heterogeneous data compared to classical one-kernel approaches.","S. Özöğür-Akyüz1 & G.-W.

The framework was based on the internal variable theory and the mechanism analysis. The ER suspension consists fo fine particles with high dielectric constant and the supporting fluid. Under the action of the electric field, the polarized particles will aggregate together to form the chain-like structures along the direction of the electric field. As the size and orientation of the particle aggregates are volatile, and they adjust according to the applied electric field and strain rate, the energy conservation equation and the force equilibrium equation were thus established to determine the orientation and size of the aggregates. Following that, a three-dimensional, explicit form of the constitutive equation was derived based on the interaction energy and the dissipation function of the system. The response of the system under the action of a simple shearing load was considered and discussed in detail. It is found that the shear-thinning viscosity of an ER suspension is well approximated by the power-law ∝ (Mn)−0.82.",Wang Biao1 & Xiao Zhong-min,Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02437884,"electrorheological fluid,internal variable theory,constitutive theory"

Jones conjectured in [7] that Algebraic K-theory of virtually cyclic subgroups V should constitute `building blocks' for the Algebraic K-theory of an arbitrary group G. In [6], they obtained some results on lower K-theory of V. In this paper, we obtain results on higher K-theory of virtually infinite cyclic groups V in the two cases: (i) when V admits an epimorphism (with finite kernel) to the infinite cyclic group (see 2.1 and 2.2(a),(b)) and (ii) when V admits an epimorphism (with finite kernel) to the infinite dihedral group (see 3.1, 3.2, 3.3).",Aderemi O.

1022,"Theory of Compressive Sensing via ℓ
1-Minimization: a Non-RIP Analysis and Extensions","Compressive sensing (CS) is an emerging methodology in computational signal processing that has recently attracted intensive research activities. At present, the basic CS theory includes recoverability and stability: the former quantifies the central fact that a sparse signal of length n can be exactly recovered from far fewer than n measurements via ℓ
1-minimization or other recovery techniques, while the latter specifies the stability of a recovery technique in the presence of measurement errors and inexact sparsity. So far, most analyses in CS rely heavily on the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) for matrices.In this paper, we present an alternative, non-RIP analysis for CS via ℓ
1-minimization. Our purpose is three-fold: (a) to introduce an elementary and RIP-free treatment of the basic CS theory; (b) to extend the current recoverability and stability results so that prior knowledge can be utilized to enhance recovery via ℓ
1-minimization; and (c) to substantiate a property called uniform recoverability of ℓ
1-minimization; that is, for almost all random measurement matrices recoverability is asymptotically identical. With the aid of two classic results, the non-RIP approach enables us to quickly derive from scratch all basic results for the extended theory.",Yin Zhang,Journal of the Operations Research Society of China,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40305-013-0010-2,"Compressive sensing,

1027,"Low-lying Zeros of Quadratic Dirichlet L-Functions, Hyper-elliptic Curves and Random Matrix Theory","The statistics of low-lying zeros of quadratic Dirichlet L-functions were conjectured by Katz and Sarnak to be given by the scaling limit of eigenvalues from the unitary symplectic ensemble. The n-level densities were found to be in agreement with this in a certain neighborhood of the origin in the Fourier domain by Rubinstein in his Ph.D. thesis in 1998. An attempt to extend the neighborhood was made in the Ph.D. thesis of Peng Gao (n-level density of the low-lying zeros of quadratic Dirichlet L-functions, 2005), who under GRH gave the density as a complicated combinatorial factor, but it remained open whether it coincides with the Random Matrix Theory factor. For n ≤ 7 this was recently confirmed by Levinson and Miller. We resolve this problem for all n, not by directly doing the combinatorics, but by passing to a function field analogue, of L-functions associated to hyper-elliptic curves of given genus g over a field of q elements. We show that the answer in this case coincides with Gao’s combinatorial factor up to a controlled error. We then take the limit of large finite field size q → ∞ and use the Katz–Sarnak equidistribution theorem, which identifies the monodromy of the Frobenius conjugacy classes for the hyperelliptic ensemble with the group USp(2g). Further taking the limit of large genus g→ ∞ allows us to identify Gao’s combinatorial factor with the RMT answer.","Alexei Entin1, Edva Roditty-Gershon1 & Zeév Rudnick",Geometric and Functional Analysis,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00039-013-0241-8,"Conjugacy Class,Random Matrix Theory,Hyperelliptic Curve,Monic Polynomial,Schwartz Function"

A frequency-hopping-based joint radar-communication system enables implementing a primary radar operation and a secondary communication function simultaneously. Then, we consider the problems of radar codes optimization under a peak-to-average-power ratio and an energy constraint. These radar codes design problems can be converted into non-convex quadratic programs with a finite or an infinite number of quadratic constraints. All problems are proved to be NP-hard optimization problems. Therefore, we develop optimization approaches, resorting to semi-definite programming relaxation technique along with to the idea of trigonometric polynomials, offering expected approximate solutions with a polynomial time calculation burden. We assess the capability of the proposed schemes, considering both the detection probability and the robustness in correspondence of Doppler shifts offered by the Neyman–Pearson detector. Simulation results show an improvement in detection performance as the average signal-to-noise ratio value increases, while still maintaining low symbol error rates between the proposed system nodes.","Yu Yao

1033,Limit linear series: Basic theory,"In this paper we introduce techniques for handling the degeneration of linear series on smooth curves as the curves degenerate to a certain type of reducible curves, curves of compact type. The technically much simpler special case of 1-dimensional series was developed by Beauville [2], Knudsen [21–23], Harris and Mumford [17], in the guise of “admissible covers”. It has proved very useful for studying the Moduli space of curves (the above papers and Harris [16]) and the simplest sorts of Weierstrass points (Diaz [4]). With our extended tools we are able to prove, for example, that:

1)
The Moduli spaceM

g
 of curves of genusg has general type forg≧24, and has Kodaira dimension ≧1 forg=23, extending and simplifying the work of Harris and Mumford [17] and Harris [16].


2)
Given a Weierstrass semigroup Γ of genusg and weightw≦g/2 (and in a somewhat more general case) there exists at least one component of the subvariety ofM

g
 of curves possessing a Weierstrass point of semigroup Γ which has the “expected” dimension 3g-2−w (and in particular, this set is not empty).


3)
The fundamental group of the space of smooth genusg curves having distinct “ordinary” Weierstrass points acts on the Weierstrass points by monodromy as the full symmetric group.


4)
Ifr andd are chosen so that
$$\rho : = g - (r + 1)(g - d + r) = 0,$$
 then the general curve of genusg has a certain finite number ofg

r’
d

s [15, 20]. We show that the family of all these, allowing the curve to vary among general curves, is irreducible, so that the monodromy of this family acts transitively. If4=1, we show further that the monodromy acts as the full symmetric group.


5)
Ifr andd are chosen so that
$$\rho  =  - 1,$$
 then the subvariety ofM

g
 consisting of curves posessing ag

r
d

 has exactly one irreducible component of codimension 1.


6)
For anyr, g, d such that ρ≦0, the subvariety ofM

g
 consisting of curves possessing ag

r
d

 has at least one irreducible component of codimension—ρ so long as
$$\rho  \geqq \left\{ \begin{gathered}   - g + r + 3              (r odd) \hfill \\   - \frac{r}{{r + 2}}g + r + 3      (r even). \hfill \\ \end{gathered}  \right.$$

An algorithm for constructing the so-called correcting operators, differing from the identity matrix by a small-rank term, is suggested. A correcting operator improves the matrix action on a subspace of small dimension and provides the possibility of controlling its action on the complementary subspace. In the algorithm suggested, correcting operators are computed by using the operation of multiplying the original matrix by a vector. The resulting preconditioner is a composition of basic correctors. Its nonsingularity is established in the general unsymmetric and indefinite case, and estimates enabling one to predict the convergence properties of the corresponding iterative algorithm are obtained. In order to reduce the arithmetic and memory costs, it is suggested to replace correcting operators by their approximations. Estimates for the resulting deterioration of the preconditioning quality are presented. Bibliography: 3 titles.",S. A. Kharchenko1 & A. Yu.

Intrinsic fractional harmonic maps are critical points of an energy whose first variation is a Dirichlet to Neumann map for the harmonic map problem on a half-space with a Riemannian metric which can degenerate/become singular along the boundary, depending on the fractional power. Similarly to the approach used to prove regularity for stationary intrinsic semi-harmonic maps, we take advantage of the connection between fractional harmonic maps and free boundary problems for harmonic maps in order to develop a partial regularity theory for the fractional harmonic maps we consider. In particular, we prove partial regularity for locally minimising harmonic maps with (partially) free boundary data on half-spaces with the aforementioned metrics up to the boundary; fractional harmonic maps then inherit this regularity. As a by-product of our methods we shed some new light on the monotonicity of the average energy of solutions of the degenerate linear elliptic equation related to fractional harmonic functions.",James Roberts,Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00526-018-1384-0,"35J85,58E20,35S99,31A05,35B05,35D10,35J70,35R35"

1052,Variation of geometric invariant theory quotients,"Geometric Invariant Theory gives a method for constructing quotients for group actions on algebraic varieties which in many cases appear as moduli spaces parameterizing isomorphism classes of geometric objects (vector bundles, polarized varieties, etc.). The quotient depends on a choice of an ample linearized line bundle. Two choices are equivalent if they give rise to identical quotients. A priori, there are infinitely many choices since there are infinitely many isomorphism classes of linearized ample line bundles. Hence several natural questions arise. Is the set of equivalence classes, and hence the set of non-isomorphic quotients, finite? How does the quotient vary under change of the equivalence class? In this paper we give partial answers to these questions in the case of actions of reductive algebraic groups on nonsingular projective algebraic varieties. We shall show that among ample line bundles which give projective geometric quotients there are only finitely many equivalence classes.

1053,A Tableau Approach to the Representation Theory of 0-Hecke Algebras,"A 0-Hecke algebra is a deformation of the group algebra of a Coxeter group. Based on work of Norton and Krob-Thibon, we introduce a tableau approach to the representation theory of 0-Hecke algebras of type A, which resembles the classic approach to the representation theory of symmetric groups by Young tableaux and tabloids. We extend this approach to types B and D, and obtain a correspondence between the representation theory of 0-Hecke algebras of types B and D and quasisymmetric functions and noncommutative symmetric functions of types B and D. Other applications are also provided.",Jia Huang,Annals of Combinatorics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00026-016-0338-5,"05E05,05E10"
1054,Maximum likelihood estimation of the Heston stochastic volatility model using asset and option prices: an application of nonlinear filtering theory,"Let us suppose that the dynamics of the stock prices and of their stochastic variance is described by the Heston model, that is by a system of two stochastic differential equations with a suitable initial condition. The aim of this paper is to estimate the parameters of the Heston model and one component of the initial condition, that is the initial stochastic variance, from the knowledge of the stock and option prices observed at discrete times. The option prices considered refer to an European call on the stock whose prices are described by the Heston model. The method proposed to solve this problem is based on a filtering technique to construct a likelihood function and on the maximization of the likelihood function obtained. The estimated parameters and initial value component are characterized as being a maximizer of the likelihood function subject to some constraints. The solution of the filtering problem, used to construct the likelihood function, is based on an integral representation of the fundamental solution of the Fokker–Planck equation associated to the Heston model, on the use of the wavelet expansions presented in (Fatone et al. in High performance algorithms based on a new wavelet expansion for time dependent acoustic obstacle scattering.

SIAM J. Sci. Comput. (submitted)) to approximate the integral kernel appearing in the representation formula of the fundamental solution, on a simple truncation procedure to exploit the sparsifying properties of the wavelet expansions and on the use of the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The use of these techniques generates a very efficient and fully parallelizable numerical procedure to solve the filtering problem, this last fact makes possible to evaluate very efficiently the likelihood function and its gradient. As a byproduct of the solution of the filtering problem we have developed a stochastic variance tracking technique that gives very good results in numerical experiments. The maximum likelihood problem used in the estimation procedure is a low dimensional constrained optimization problem, its solution with ad hoc techniques is justified by the computational cost of evaluating the likelihood function and its gradient. We use parallel computing and a variable metric steepest ascent method to solve the maximum likelihood problem. Some numerical examples of the estimation problem using synthetic and real data, that is data relative to an index of the Milano stock exchange (S&PMIB30), obtained with a parallel implementation of the previous numerical method are presented. Very impressive speed up factors are obtained in the numerical examples using the parallel implementation of the numerical method proposed.

1055,The use of possibility theory in the definition of fuzzy Pareto-optimality,"Pareto-optimality conditions are crucial when dealing with classic multi-objective optimization problems. Extensions of these conditions to the fuzzy domain have been discussed and addressed in recent literature. This work presents a novel approach based on the definition of a fuzzily ordered set with a view to generating the necessary conditions for the Pareto-optimality of candidate solutions in the fuzzy domain. Making use of the conditions generated, one can characterize fuzzy efficient solutions by means of carefully chosen mono-objective problems and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to fuzzy non-dominated solutions. The uncertainties are inserted into the formulation of the studied fuzzy multi-objective optimization problem by means of fuzzy coefficients in the objective function. Some numerical examples are analytically solved to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.",Ricardo C.

On the other hand, Burris also noted in 1971 that the equational theory of \({\mathcal {L}}_{\Delta }\) is decidable. We use the work of Jaroslav Ježek in a effort to find the point along the spectrum from the equational theory to the elementary theory where undecidability enters. We provide four additional proofs that \({\mathcal {L}}_{\Delta }\) has an undecidable elementary theory. Our sharpest result is that the \(\forall ^*\exists ^*\forall ^*\) theory of \({\mathcal {L}}_{\Delta }\) is hereditarily undecidable.",George F.

1057,Operator Scaling: Theory and Applications,"In this paper, we present a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for testing whether a symbolic matrix in non-commuting variables over \({\mathbb {Q}}\) is invertible or not. The analogous question for commuting variables is the celebrated polynomial identity testing (PIT) for symbolic determinants. In contrast to the commutative case, which has an efficient probabilistic algorithm, the best previous algorithm for the non-commutative setting required exponential time (Ivanyos et al. in Comput Complex 26(3):717–763, 2017) (whether or not randomization is allowed). The algorithm efficiently solves the “word problem” for the free skew field, and the identity testing problem for arithmetic formulae with division over non-commuting variables, two problems which had only exponential time algorithms prior to this work. The main contribution of this paper is a complexity analysis of an existing algorithm due to Gurvits (J Comput Syst Sci 69(3):448–484, 2004), who proved it was polynomial time for certain classes of inputs. We prove it always runs in polynomial time. The main component of our analysis is a simple (given the necessary known tools) lower bound on central notion of capacity of operators (introduced by Gurvits 2004). We extend the algorithm to actually approximate capacity to any accuracy in polynomial time, and use this analysis to give quantitative bounds on the continuity of capacity (the latter is used in a subsequent paper on Brascamp–Lieb inequalities). We also extend the algorithm to compute not only singularity, but actually the (non-commutative) rank of a symbolic matrix, yielding a factor 2 approximation of the commutative rank. This naturally raises a relaxation of the commutative PIT problem to achieving better deterministic approximation of the commutative rank. Symbolic matrices in non-commuting variables, and the related structural and algorithmic questions, have a remarkable number of diverse origins and motivations. They arise independently in (commutative) invariant theory and representation theory, linear algebra, optimization, linear system theory, quantum information theory, approximation of the permanent and naturally in non-commutative algebra. We provide a detailed account of some of these sources and their interconnections. In particular, we explain how some of these sources played an important role in the development of Gurvits’ algorithm and in our analysis of it here.","Ankit Garg1, Leonid Gurvits2, Rafael Oliveira3 & …Avi Wigderson",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-019-09417-z,"Derandomization,Non-commutative algebra,Polynomial identity testing,Invariant theory,Quantum operators"

1060,Global theory of one-frequency Schrödinger operators,"We study Schrödinger operators with a one-frequency analytic potential, focusing on the transition between the two distinct local regimes characteristic respectively of large and small potentials. From the dynamical point of view, the transition signals the emergence of non-uniform hyperbolicity, so the dependence of the Lyapunov exponent with respect to parameters plays a central role in the analysis. Though often ill-behaved by conventional measures, we show that the Lyapunov exponent is in fact remarkably regular in a “stratified sense” which we define: the irregularity comes from the matching of nice (analytic or smooth) functions along sets with complicated geometry. This result allows us to establish that the “critical set” for the transition lies within countably many codimension one subvarieties of the (infinite-dimensional) parameter space. A more refined renormalization-based analysis shows that the critical set is rather thin within those subvarieties, and allows us to conclude that a typical potential has no critical energies. Such acritical potentials also form an open set and have several interesting properties: only finitely many “phase transitions” may happen, but never at any specific point in the spectrum, and the Lyapunov exponent is minorated in the region of the spectrum where it is positive. On the other hand, we do show that the number of phase transitions can be arbitrarily large.Key to our approach are two results about the dependence of the Lyapunov exponent of one-frequency SL\({(2,\mathbb{C})}\) cocycles with respect to perturbations in the imaginary direction: on one hand there is a severe “quantization” restriction, and on the other hand “regularity” of the dependence characterizes uniform hyperbolicity when the Lyapunov exponent is positive. Our method is independent of arithmetic conditions on the frequency.","Artur Avila1,",Acta Mathematica,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11511-015-0128-7,"symplectic diffeomorphisms,partial hyperbolicity,Lyapunov exponents,generic properties"

1063,Mathematical programs with vanishing constraints: critical point theory,"We study mathematical programs with vanishing constraints (MPVCs) from a topological point of view. We introduce the new concept of a T-stationary point for MPVC. Under the Linear Independence Constraint Qualification we derive an equivariant Morse Lemma at nondegenerate T-stationary points. Then, two basic theorems from Morse Theory (deformation theorem and cell-attachment theorem) are proved. Outside the T-stationary point set, continuous deformation of lower level sets can be performed. As a consequence, the topological data (such as the number of connected components) then remain invariant. However, when passing a T-stationary level, the topology of the lower level set changes via the attachment of a q-dimensional cell. The dimension q equals the stationary T-index of the (nondegenerate) T-stationary point. The stationary T-index depends on both the restricted Hessian of the Lagrangian and the number of bi-active vanishing constraints. Further, we prove that all T-stationary points are generically nondegenerate. The latter property is shown to be stable under C
2-perturbations of the defining functions. Finally, some relations with other stationarity concepts, such as strong, weak, and M-stationarity, are discussed.","Dominik Dorsch1, Vladimir Shikhman1 & Oliver Stein",Journal of Global Optimization,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-011-9805-z,"Mathematical programs with vanishing constraints,MPVC,T-stationarity,Stationary T-index,Morse theory,Genericity"
1064,The neutrino theory of light,"The standpoint assumed by Jordan is the following. Before the radioactive processes revealed the probability of the existence of the neutrinos, the only experimentally known wave fields were those which appear now as pure light fields. They turn out to be only a limiting case of a very much larger multitude of possible fields, which contain free (not compensated) neutrinos. The validity of this hypothesis could be experimentally tested by a study of a possible influence of radiation fields on the β-decay. If it is true that the β-emission is accompanied by an emission of a neutrino there should be an influence of an external neutrino field on the β-emission. But since light fields are nothing than neutrino fields (with neutrino pairs) we should also expect an influence of light radiation on the β-decay. The law of this interaction has yet to be calculated.We wish to make another remark. Quantum mechanics was started by replacing the Fourier amplitudesqk

A distinctive feature of these methods is that they are optimal not only in the order of accuracy of resulting approximate solutions, but also with respect to a user-specified quality functional. Such functionals can be specified, for example, as an a posteriori estimate of the quality (accuracy) of approximate solutions, a posteriori estimates of various linear functionals of these solutions, and estimates of their mathematical entropy and multidimensional variations of chosen types. The relationship between regularizing algorithms that are extra-optimal and optimal in the order of quality is studied. Issues concerning the practical derivation of a posteriori estimates for the quality of approximate solutions are addressed, and numerical algorithms for finding such estimates are described. The exposition is illustrated by results of numerical experiments.",A. S.

In fact, the sets are shown to satisfy delicate zero-infinity laws with respect to Lebesgue and Hausdorff measures. These laws are reminiscent of those satisfied by the classical set of well approximable real numbers, for example as demonstrated by Khintchine's theorem.","Victor Beresnevich1, Detta Dickinson2 & Sanju Velani",Mathematische Annalen,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002080100225,"Real Number,Linear Form,Critical Exponent,Hausdorff Dimension,Hausdorff Measure"

In addition to the classical definitions of strong and weak equivalence, we consider new notions of Sing-equivalence and moderate equivalence. These definitions seem to be more relevant to and consistent with the intuitive notion of equivalent bifurcations.

Both approaches are confined, like most of classical mathematics, to total and deterministic operations. So traditional closure theory makes it possible to define the semantics of the while-do commands only for terminating and deterministic programming. This paper outlines a closure theory for relations which transcend totality and determinism. For the sake of conciseness, the language used is that of graph theory but the methods are category-theoretic and some hints are offered for a possible translation into the language of category theory. Our basic idea is that closure relations consist of universal arrows in the sense of category theory. The new closure theory is appropriate for defining a semantics of the while-do commands both for terminating, deterministic programming and for non-terminating, non-deterministic programming.",G. M.

Covariant (or characteristic) Lyapunov vectors indicate these directions. Though the concept of these vectors has been known for a long time, they became practically computable only recently due to algorithms suggested by Ginelli et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 2007, 130601] and by Wolfe and Samelson [Tellus 59A, 2007, 355]. In view of the great interest in covariant Lyapunov vectors and their wide range of potential applications, in this article we summarize the available information related to Lyapunov vectors and provide a detailed explanation of both the theoretical basics and numerical algorithms. We introduce the notion of adjoint covariant Lyapunov vectors. The angles between these vectors and the original covariant vectors are norm-independent and can be considered as characteristic numbers. Moreover, we present and study in detail an improved approach for computing covariant Lyapunov vectors. Also we describe how one can test for hyperbolicity of chaotic dynamics without explicitly computing covariant vectors.","Pavel V.

1097,Differentiated cell behavior: a multiscale approach using measure theory,"This paper deals with the derivation of a collective model of cell populations out of an individual-based description of the underlying physical particle system. By looking at the spatial distribution of cells in terms of time-evolving measures, rather than at individual cell paths, we obtain an ensemble representation stemming from the phenomenological behavior of the single component cells. In particular, as a key advantage of our approach, the scale of representation of the system, i.e., microscopic/discrete vs. macroscopic/continuous, can be chosen a posteriori according only to the spatial structure given to the aforesaid measures. The paper focuses in particular on the use of different scales based on the specific functions performed by cells. A two-population hybrid system is considered, where cells with a specialized/differentiated phenotype are treated as a discrete population of point masses while unspecialized/undifferentiated cell aggregates are represented by a continuous approximation. Numerical simulations and analytical investigations emphasize the role of some biologically relevant parameters in determining the specific evolution of such a hybrid cell system.","Annachiara Colombi1, Marco Scianna1 & Andrea Tosin",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-014-0846-z,"Cell populations,Functional subsystems,Discrete vs. continuous descriptions,Multiscale dynamics"

1(X;ℝ). This theory has similar properties as the classical Lusternik-Schnirelman theory. In particular in [7] Farber defines a homotopy invariant cat(X,ξ) as a generalization of the Lusternik-Schnirelman category. If X is a closed smooth manifold this invariant relates to the number of zeros of a closed 1-form ω representing ξ. Namely, a closed 1-form ω representing ξ which admits a gradient-like vector field with no homoclinic cycles has at least cat(X,ξ) zeros. In this paper we define an invariant F(X,ξ) for closed smooth manifolds X which gives the least number of zeros a closed 1-form representing ξ can have such that it admits a gradient-like vector field without homoclinic cycles and give estimations for this number.

1103,An n-level field theory of biological neural networks,"An n-level field theory, based on the concept of “functional interaction”, is proposed for a description of the continuous dynamics of biological neural networks. A “functional interaction” describes the action from one substructure of a network to another at several levels of organization, molecular, synaptic, and neural. Because of the continuous representation of neurons and synapses, which constitute a hierarchical system, it is shown that the property of non-locality leads to a non-local field operator in the field equations. In a hierarchical continuous system, the finite velocity of the functional interaction at the lower level implies non-locality at the higher level. Two other properties of the functional interaction are introduced in the formulation: the non-symmetry between sources and sinks, and the non-uniformity of the medium. Thus, it is shown that: (i) The coupling between topology and geometry can be introduced via two functions, the density of neurons at the neuronal level of organization, and the density-connectivity of synapses between two points of the neural space at the synaptic level of organization. With densities chosen as Dirac functions at regularly spaced points, the dynamics of a discrete network becomes a particular case of the n-level field theory. (ii) The dynamics at each of the molecular and synaptic lower level are introduced, at the next upper level, both in the source and in the non-local interaction of the field to integrate the dynamics at the neural level. (iii) New learning rules are deduced from the structure of the field equations: Hebbian rules result from strictly local activation; non-Hebbian rules result from homosynaptic activation with strict heterosynaptic effects, i.e., when an activated synaptic pathway affects the efficacy of a non-activated one; non-Hebbian rules and/or non-linearities result from the structure of the interaction operator and/or the internal biochemical kinetics.","G.

Roughly, given a base graph G and an integer n, we form a random graph by replacing each vertex of G by a set of n vertices, and joining these sets by random matchings whenever the corresponding vertices are adjacent in G. The resulting graph covers the original graph in the sense that the two are locally isomorphic. We suggest possible applications of the model, such as constructing graphs with extremal properties in a more controlled fashion than offered by the standard random models, and also ""randomizing"" given graphs.

1108,"Structure theory for ensemble controllability, observability, and duality","Ensemble control deals with the problem of using a finite number of control inputs to simultaneously steer a large population (in the limit, a continuum) of control systems. Dual to the ensemble control problem, ensemble estimation deals with the problem of using a finite number of measurement outputs to estimate the initial state of every individual system in the ensemble. We introduce in the paper a novel class of ensemble systems, termed distinguished ensemble systems, and establish sufficient conditions for controllability and observability of such systems. Every distinguished ensemble system has two key components, namely a set of distinguished control vector fields and a set of codistinguished observation functions. Roughly speaking, a set of vector fields is distinguished if it is closed (up to scaling) under Lie bracket, and moreover, every vector field in the set can be obtained by a Lie bracket of two vector fields in the same set. Similarly, a set of functions is codistinguished to a set of vector fields if the Lie derivatives of the functions along the given vector fields yield (up to scaling) the same set of functions. We demonstrate in the paper that the structure of a distinguished ensemble system can significantly simplify the analysis of ensemble controllability and observability. Moreover, such a structure can be used as a guiding principle for ensemble system design. We further address in the paper the problem about existence of a distinguished ensemble system for a given manifold. We provide an affirmative answer for the case where the manifold is a connected semi-simple Lie group. Specifically, we show that every such Lie group admits a set of distinguished vector fields, together with a set of codistinguished functions. The proof is constructive, leveraging the structure theory of semi-simple real Lie algebras and representation theory. Examples will be provided along the presentation of the paper illustrating key definitions and main results.","Xudong Chen

We compute explicit formulae for the corresponding cluster \({{\mathcal {A}} }\)- and \({{\mathcal {X}} }\)-transformations. As a result, we obtain green sequences and the cluster Donaldson–Thomas transformation for \(Q_m({\mathfrak {g}})\) in a systematic way when \({\mathfrak {g}}\) is of finite type. Moreover if \({\mathfrak {g}}\) is of classical finite type with the Coxeter number h, the quiver \(Q_{kh}({\mathfrak {g}})\) (\(k \ge 1\)) is mutation-equivalent to a quiver encoding the cluster structure of the higher Teichmüller space of a once-punctured disk with 2k marked points on the boundary, up to frozen vertices. This correspondence induces the action of direct products of Weyl groups on the higher Teichmüller space of a general marked surface. We finally prove that this action coincides with the one constructed in Goncharov and Shen (Adv Math 327:225–348, 2018) from the geometrical viewpoint.

The goal of this theory is to construct a “vertex tensor category” structure on the category of modules for a suitable vertex operator algebra. The notion of vertex tensor category is essentially a “complex analogue” of the notion of symmetric tensor category, and in fact a vertex tensor category produces a braided tensor category in a natural way. The theory applies in particular to many familiar “rational” vertex operator algebras, including those associated with WZNW models, minimal models and the moonshine module.

1117,Rigorous Computer-Assisted Application of KAM Theory: A Modern Approach,"In this paper, we present and illustrate a general methodology to apply KAM theory in particular problems, based on an a posteriori approach. We focus on the existence of real analytic quasi-periodic Lagrangian invariant tori for symplectic maps. The purpose is to verify the hypotheses of a KAM theorem in an a posteriori format: Given a parameterization of an approximately invariant torus, we have to check non-resonance (Diophantine) conditions, non-degeneracy conditions and certain inequalities to hold. To check such inequalities, we require to control the analytic norm of some functions that depend on the map, the ambient structure and the parameterization. To this end, we propose an efficient computer-assisted methodology, using fast Fourier transform, having the same asymptotic cost of using the parameterization method for obtaining numerical approximations of invariant tori. We illustrate our methodology by proving the existence of invariant curves for the standard map (up to \(\varepsilon =0.9716\)), meandering curves for the non-twist standard map and 2-dimensional tori for the Froeschlé map.","J.-Ll.

1119,Foundations of a mathematical theory of darwinism,"This paper pursues the ‘formal darwinism’ project of Grafen, whose aim is to construct formal links between dynamics of gene frequencies and optimization programmes, in very abstract settings with general implications for biologically relevant situations. A major outcome is the definition, within wide assumptions, of the ubiquitous but problematic concept of ‘fitness’. This paper is the first to present the project for mathematicians. Within the framework of overlapping generations in discrete time and no social interactions, the current model shows links between fitness maximization and gene frequency change in a class-structured population, with individual-level uncertainty but no uncertainty in the class projection operator, where individuals are permitted to observe and condition their behaviour on arbitrary parts of the uncertainty. The results hold with arbitrary numbers of loci and alleles, arbitrary dominance and epistasis, and make no assumptions about linkage, linkage disequilibrium or mating system. An explicit derivation is given of Fisher’s Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection in its full generality.","Charles J. K.

1120,Nonsmooth critical point theory and applications to the spectral graph theory,"Existing critical point theories including metric and topological critical point theories are difficult to be applied directly to some concrete problems in particular polyhedral settings, because the notions of critical sets could be either very vague or too large. To overcome these difficulties, we develop the critical point theory for nonsmooth but Lipschitzian functions defined on convex polyhedrons. This yields natural extensions of classical results in the critical point theory, such as the Liusternik-Schnirelmann multiplicity theorem. More importantly, eigenvectors for some eigenvalue problems involving graph 1-Laplacian coincide with critical points of the corresponding functions on polytopes, which indicates that the critical point theory proposed in the present paper can be applied to study the nonlinear spectral graph theory.","Kung-Ching Chang1, Sihong Shao1, Dong Zhang1 & …Weixi Zhang",Science China Mathematics,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-019-1625-8,"critical point theory,nonsmooth analysis,combinatorial optimization,polytope,spectral graph theory"

A Galois framework is introduced to describe the sets of operations that are closed under the operations mentioned above, not necessarily containing all projections.

1124,Transient flow of magnetized Maxwell nanofluid: Buongiorno model perspective of Cattaneo-Christov theory,"The present research article is devoted to studying the characteristics of Cattaneo-Christov heat and mass fluxes in the Maxwell nanofluid flow caused by a stretching sheet with the magnetic field properties. The Maxwell nanofluid is investigated with the impact of the Lorentz force to examine the consequence of a magnetic field on the flow characteristics and the transport of energy. The heat and mass transport mechanisms in the current physical model are analyzed with the modified versions of Fourier’s and Fick’s laws, respectively. Additionally, the well-known Buongiorno model for the nanofluids is first introduced together with the Cattaneo-Christov heat and mass fluxes during the transient motion of the Maxwell fluid. The governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for the flow and energy transport phenomena are obtained by using the Maxwell model and the Cattaneo-Christov theory in addition to the laws of conservation. Appropriate transformations are used to convert the PDEs into a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The homotopic solution methodology is applied to the nonlinear differential system for an analytic solution. The results for the time relaxation parameter in the flow, thermal energy, and mass transport equations are discussed graphically. It is noted that higher values of the thermal and solutal relaxation time parameters in the Cattaneo-Christov heat and mass fluxes decline the thermal and concentration fields of the nanofluid. Further, larger values of the thermophoretic force enhance the heat and mass transport in the nanoliquid. Moreover, the Brownian motion of the nanoparticles declines the concentration field and increases the temperature field. The validation of the results is assured with the help of numerical tabular data for the surface velocity gradient.","M. Khan1, A. Ahmed1 & J.

To accomplish this, a new notion of critical object of a discrete Morse function is presented, which generalizes the usual concept of critical simplex (in the sense of R. Forman). We show that the non-existence of such critical objects guarantees the strong homotopy equivalence (in the Barmak and Minian’s sense) between the corresponding sublevel complexes.

Such an invariant can be expressed in terms of the number of proper colorings of the regions into which a knot diagram divides the 2-sphere. A coloring with elements of a set X is proper if the colors of all four regions in a neighborhood of each crossing point of the diagram are matched by means of a function Q: X×X×X → X. This function is called a quasoid over the set X. In this paper,we construct two infinite series of quasoids. The first series is formed by linear quasoids over finite rings. The second series consists of quasoids generated by finite biquasiles. The invariants of knots and links generated by quasoids are nontrivial and can be used to distinguish knots. We show that all knots and links admitting diagrams with at most six crossings are distinguished by linear quasoids over ℤn, where n ≤ 11. We give results of the computer enumeration of all different quasoids over sets whose cardinality does not exceed 4.","F. G.

1136,Von Kármán rotating flow of Maxwell nanofluids featuring the Cattaneo-Christov theory with a Buongiorno model,"This research paper analyzes the transport of thermal and solutal energy in the Maxwell nanofluid flow induced above the disk which is rotating with a constant angular velocity. The significant features of thermal and solutal relaxation times of fluids are studied with a Cattaneo-Christov double diffusion theory rather than the classical Fourier’s and Fick’s laws. A novel idea of a Buongiorno nanofluid model together with the Cattaneo-Christov theory is introduced for the first time for the Maxwell fluid flow over a rotating disk. Additionally, the thermal and solutal distributions are controlled with the impacts of heat source and chemical reaction. The classical von Kármán similarities are used to acquire the non-linear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The analytical series solution to the governing ODEs is obtained with the well-known homotopy analysis method (HAM). The validation of results is provided with the published results by the comparison tables. The graphically presented outcomes for the physical problem reveal that the higher values of the stretching strength parameter enhance the radial velocity and decline the circumferential velocity. The increasing trend is noted for the axial velocity profile in the downward direction with the higher values of the stretching strength parameter. The higher values of the relaxation time parameters in the Cattaneo-Christov theory decrease the thermal and solutal energy transport in the flow of Maxwell nanoliquids. The higher rate of the heat transport is observed in the case of a larger thermophoretic force.","A. Ahmed1, M. Khan1, J. Ahmed1,2 & …A.

1144,Extremal Examples of Collapsible Complexes and Random Discrete Morse Theory,"We present extremal constructions connected with the property of simplicial collapsibility. (1) For each \(d \ge 2\), there are collapsible (and shellable) simplicial d-complexes with only one free face. Also, there are non-evasive d-complexes with only two free faces (both results are optimal in all dimensions). (2) Optimal discrete Morse vectors need not be unique. We explicitly construct a contractible, but non-collapsible 3-dimensional simplicial complex with face vector \(f=(106,596,1064,573)\) that admits two distinct optimal discrete Morse vectors, (1, 1, 1, 0) and (1, 0, 1, 1). Indeed, we show that in every dimension \(d\ge 3\) there are contractible, non-collapsible simplicial d-complexes that have \((1,0,\dots ,0,1,1,0)\) and \((1,0,\dots ,0,0,1,1)\) as distinct optimal discrete Morse vectors.

1145,Mathematical theory for plant—herbivore systems,"The interactions of host plants with herbivores can be mediated by factors other than population sizes or biomass alone. Recent evidence indicates that features of the vegetation (loosely termed “plant quality”) may change in response to herbivory and may, in turn, influence the performance of herbivores (i.e. by affecting survivorship, fecundity, or growth rates). A model which incorporates the effect of plant quality is presented. First it is shown that the frequency distribution of plant quality in the vegetation (p(q, t)) satisfies an equation of conservation. Then, qualitative aspects of the system are discussed in three situations: (1) mobile herbivores interacting with all plants; (2) sessile herbivores feeding exclusively on single plants; (3) intermediate situations in which mobility is moderate to low.I show that depending on the plant quality response, f(q, h), and the herbivore response, g(q, h), it is possible to obtain stable equilibria as well as stable periodic oscillations. In the former case the populations tend to lose their heterogeneity. In the latter case, oscillations are accompanied by alternate narrowing and broadening of the distribution. Empirical testing and further research are suggested.",Leah Edelstein-Keshet,Journal of Mathematical Biology,1986,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00275719,"Plant-herbivore systems,Plant quality,Structured populations,Conservation laws,Mathematical models"

It is shown that the theory provides a mathematical foundation and a quantitative model for these discrete error criteria. It is also shown that estimating the conditional average error is equivalent to testing error with the spline interpolation as a sample integrand, and that this process can be made implicit by using appropriate error criteria with local error-checks.","Feng Gao1,",Numerische Mathematik,1989,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01396607,"AMS(MOS): 65D32,CR: G1.4"

The cost of each iteration is of the same order as two flow solutions, since the adjoint equation is of comparable complexity to the flow equation, and the remaining auxiliary equations could be solved quite inexpensively. Provided, therefore, that one can afford the cost of a moderate number of flow solutions, procedures of this type can be used to derive improved designs. The approach is quite general, not limited to particular choices of the coordinate transformation or cost function, which might in fact contain measures of other criteria of performance such as lift and drag. For the sake of simplicity certain complicating factors, such as the need to include a special term in the mapping function to generate a corner at the trailing edge, have been suppressed from the present analysis. Also it remains to explore the numerical implementation of the design procedures proposed in this paper.",Antony Jameson,Journal of Scientific Computing,1988,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01061285,"Computational aerodynamics,transonic flow,inverse problem,wing design,optimization"

1161,The fundamental theory of abstract majorization inequalities,"Using the axiomatic method, abstract concepts such as abstract mean, abstract convex function and abstract majorization are proposed. They are the generalizations of concepts of mean, convex function and majorization, respectively.

i
, y

i
 ∈ I (i = 1, 2,..., n) satisfy that \( (x_1 ,x_2 , \ldots ,x_n ) \prec _n^\Sigma (y_1 ,y_2 , \ldots ,y_n ) \) then \( \Sigma ' \){f(x

1), f(y

Moreover, concepts such as abstract vector mean are proposed, the fundamental theorems about abstract majorization inequalities are generalized to n-dimensional vector space. The fundamental theorem of majorization inequalities about the abstract vector mean are established as follows: for arbitrary symmetrical convex set \( \mathcal{S} \subset \mathbb{R}^n \), and n-variable abstract symmetrical \( \overline \Sigma \) ↪ \( \Sigma ' \) strict convex function \( \phi (\bar x) \) on \( \mathcal{S} \), if \( \bar x,\bar y \in \mathcal{S} \), satisfy \( \bar x \prec _n^\Sigma \bar y \), then \( \phi (\bar x) \geqslant \phi (\bar y) \); if vector group \( \bar x_i ,\bar y_i \in \mathcal{S}(i = 1,2, \ldots ,m) \) satisfy \( \{ \bar x_1 ,\bar x_2 , \ldots ,\bar x_m \} \prec _n^{\bar \Sigma } \{ \bar y_1 ,\bar y_2 , \ldots ,\bar y_m \} \), then \( \Sigma '\{ \phi (\bar x_1 ),\phi (\bar x_2 ), \ldots ,\phi (\bar x_m )\} \geqslant \Sigma '\{ \phi (\bar y_1 ),\phi (\bar y_2 ), \ldots ,\phi (\bar y_m )\} \).",DingHua Yang,Science in China Series A: Mathematics,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-009-0160-1,"abstract mean,abstract convex function,abstract majorization,abstract majorization inequality"
1162,Unified Field Theory and Principle of Representation Invariance,"The main objectives of this article are to postulate a new principle of representation invariance (PRI), and to refine the unified field model of four interactions, derived using the principle of interaction dynamics (PID). Intuitively, PID takes the variation of the action functional under energy-momentum conservation constraint, and PRI requires that physical laws be independent of representations of the gauge groups. One important outcome of this unified field model is a natural duality between the interacting fields (g,A,W
a,S
k), corresponding to graviton, photon, intermediate vector bosons W
± and Z and gluons, and the adjoint bosonic fields \((\varPhi_{\mu}, \phi^{0}, \phi^{a}_{w}, \phi^{k}_{s})\). This duality predicts two Higgs particles of similar mass with one due to weak interaction and the other due to strong interaction. The unified field model can be naturally decoupled to study individual interactions, leading to (1) modified Einstein equations, giving rise to a unified theory for dark matter and dark energy (Ma and Wang in Discrete Contin. Dyn. Syst., Ser A. 34(2):335–366, 2014), (2) three levels of strong interaction potentials for quark, nucleon/hadron, and atom respectively (Ma and Wang in Duality theory of strong interaction, 2012), and (3) two weak interaction potentials (Ma and Wang in Duality theory of weak interaction, 2012). These potential/force formulas offer a clear mechanism for both quark confinement and asymptotic freedom—a longstanding problem in particle physics (Ma and Wang in Duality theory of strong interaction, 2012).",Tian Ma1 & Shouhong Wang,Applied Mathematics & Optimization,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00245-013-9226-0,"Principle of Interaction Dynamics (PID),Principle of Representation Invariance (PRI),Unified field equations,Duality theory of interactions,Quark confinement,Asymptotic freedom,Higgs mechanism,Higgs bosons,Quark potential,Nucleon potential,Atom potential,Weak interaction potential,Strong interaction force formulas,Weak interaction force formula,Electroweak theory"

1164,"An Algorithm for Portfolio Optimization with Variable Transaction Costs, Part 1: Theory","
A portfolio optimization problem consists of maximizing an expected utility function of n assets. At the end of a typical time period, the portfolio will be modified by buying and selling assets in response to changing conditions. Associated with this buying and selling are variable transaction costs that depend on the size of the transaction. A straightforward way of incorporating these costs can be interpreted as the reduction of portfolios’ expected returns by transaction costs if the utility function is the mean-variance or the power utility function. This results in a substantially higher-dimensional problem than the original n-dimensional one, namely (2K+1)n-dimensional optimization problem with (4K+1)n additional constraints, where 2K is the number of different transaction costs functions. The higher-dimensional problem is computationally expensive to solve. This two-part paper presents a method for solving the (2K+1)n-dimensional problem by solving a sequence of n-dimensional optimization problems, which account for the transaction costs implicitly rather than explicitly. The key idea of the new method in Part 1 is to formulate the optimality conditions for the higher-dimensional problem and enforce them by solving a sequence of lower-dimensional problems under the nondegeneracy assumption. In Part 2, we propose a degeneracy resolving rule, address the efficiency of the new method and present the computational results comparing our method with the interior-point optimizer of Mosek.

1166,Characterization of flow through random media via Karhunen–Loève expansion: an information theory perspective,"We leverage on information theory to assess the fidelity of approximated numerical stochastic groundwater flow simulations. We consider flow in saturated heterogeneous porous media, where the Karhunen–Loève (KL) expansion is used to express the hydraulic conductivity as a spatially correlated random field. We quantify the impact of the KL expansion truncation on the uncertainty associated with punctual values of hydraulic conductivity and flow velocity. In particular, we compare the statistical dependence between variables by considering (a) linear correlation metrics (Pearson coefficient of correlation) and (b) metrics capable of accounting for nonlinear dependence (coefficient of uncertainty based on mutual information). We test the selected metrics by analyzing the relationship between hydraulic conductivity fields generated via Monte Carlo sampling with different levels of truncation of the KL expansion and the corresponding fluid velocity fields, obtained through the numerical solution of Darcy’s flow. Our analysis shows that employing linear correlation metrics leads to a general overestimation of the correlation level and information theory based indicators are valuable tools to assess the impact of the KL truncation on the output velocity values. We then analyze the impact of the number of retained modes on the spatial organization of the velocity field. Results indicates that (i) as the number of modes decrease the spatial correlations of the velocity field increases; (ii) linear indicators of spatial correlation are again larger than their nonlinear counterparts.","Aronne Dell’Oca

The model postulates the dynamics of a large number of intervals—referred to as domains—on the real line. The length of the intervals changes during evolution and the intervals are removed from the system once their length reaches zero. The coarsening process observed in this model exhibits a number of interesting features, such as nonhomogeneous inter-arrival times between reconfiguration events and development of spatiotemporally self-similar distributions.We generalize the standard continuous time random walk (CTRW) theory to include time-dependent jumps and subject it to time-dependent temporal rescaling to obtain an accurate non-homogeneous Poisson description of the coarsening process in the one-dimensional model. The theory leads to the evolution equation having self-similar solutions observed in simulations.The new framework allows to accurately estimate coarsening rates and characterize resulting steady-state distribution for the domain energies described by a power law of a uniformly distributed quantity. Although derived here in the context of a one-dimensional systems, this work naturally extends to higher dimensional CTRW coarsening models.","Diego Torrejon1, Maria Emelianenko1 & Dmitry Golovaty",Journal of Elliptic and Parabolic Equations,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03377401,"Primary: 82B41,Secondary: 82D35"

Recently, reaction networks have been suggested as an alternative way to model social phenomena. In this “socio-chemical metaphor” molecular species play the role of agents’ decisions and their outcomes, and chemical reactions play the role of interactions among these decisions. From here, it is possible to study the dynamical properties of social systems using standard tools of biochemical modelling. In this work we show how to use reaction networks to model systems that are usually studied via evolutionary game theory. We first illustrate our framework by modeling the repeated prisoners’ dilemma. The model is built from the payoff matrix together with assumptions of the agents’ memory and recognizability capacities. The model provides consistent results concerning the performance of the agents, and allows for the examination of the steady states of the system in a simple manner. We further develop a model considering the interaction among Tit for Tat and Defector agents. We produce analytical results concerning the performance of the strategies in different situations of agents’ memory and recognizability. This approach unites two important theories and may produce new insights in classical problems such as the evolution of cooperation in large scale systems.","Tomas Veloz1,2, Pablo Razeto-Barry2,3, Peter Dittrich4 & …Alejandro Fajardo",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-012-0626-6,"Reaction networks,Evolutionary game theory,Cooperation, Tit for Tat"

To demonstrate the equivalence of RG and IA approaches, a typical statistical mechanical problem, conventionally studied by the renormalized perturbation approach, is reconsidered from the IA point of view, and renormalized perturbation theory is applied to a partial differential equation conventionally studied by IA. This example is important because it is an explicit demonstration that the RG can be applied to partial differential equations without adding a noise source. We suggest that the ideas explained in this article may be applicable to the Navier-Stokes equation.","Nigel Goldenfeld1, Olivier Martin2 & Y.

The hydrodynamic problem is formulated as a reversible Hamiltonian system in which an arbitrary horizontal spatial direction is the time-like variable and the infinite-dimensional function space consists of wave profiles which are periodic (with fixed period) in a second, different horizontal direction. The imaginary part of the spectrum of the linearised Hamiltonian vector field consists of essential spectrum at the origin and a finite number of eigenvalues whose distribution is described geometrically. Periodic solutions to the spatial Hamiltonian system are detected using Iooss’s generalisation of the reversible Lyapunov centre theorem; these solutions correspond to doubly periodic solutions to the travelling water-wave problem. For a generic choice of the periodic domain there exist values of the physical parameters at which a doubly periodic wave with this domain exists.","G. S. Bagri1 & M. D.

Taking the hint suggested by observation, it is assumed that in the region of shadow the pattern is produced by the interference of radiations having their origin in the boundary of the aperture or the obstacle. In the region of light, the boundary radiation interferes with the primary incident waves and produces the fluctuations of intensity. The radiation from the boundary can again be effectively replaced by spherical waves originating from a finite number of point-sources on the boundary, called ‘poles’, at which the path to the point of observation from the boundary is a maximum or a minimum. This immediately gives a geometric definition of the poles as those points on the boundary whose projection on the plane of observation are the feet of the normals from the observation point to the projection of the boundary. Using this result, it is possible to geometrically map out the positions of maximum and minimum intensity in the diffraction pattern of an arbitrary aperture or obstacle. The relation between the Fresnel and Fraunhofer patterns of an aperture is discussed and it is shown that the Fresnel pattern approaches more and more to the other type as the size of the aperture is diminished or the distance to the observation screen is increased.",Y.

An application of the Bourbaki’s structure theory offers a new approach to the design and computer implementation of simulation models of complex multicomponent systems—model synthesis and model-oriented programming. It differs from the traditional object-oriented approach. The central concept of this new approach and at the same time, the basic building block for the construction of more complex structures is the concept of models-components. A model-component endowed with a more complicated structure than, for example, the object in the object-oriented analysis. This structure provides to the model-component an independent behavior-the ability of standard responds to standard requests of its internal and external environment. At the same time, the computer implementation of model-component’s behavior is invariant under the integration of models-components into complexes. This fact allows one firstly to construct fractal models of any complexity, and secondly to implement a computational process of such constructions uniformly-by a single universal program. In addition, the proposed paradigm allows one to exclude imperative programming and to generate computer code with a high degree of parallelism.",Yu. I.

1216,Quantum Mechanics and Representation Theory: The New Synthesis,"Quantum mechanics and representation theory, in the sense of unitary representations of groups on Hilbert spaces, were practically born together between 1925–1927, and have continued to enrich each other till the present day. Following a brief historical introduction, we focus on a relatively new aspect of the interaction between quantum mechanics and representation theory, based on the use of K-theory of C
*-algebras. In particular, the study of the K-theory of the reduced C
*-algebra of a locally compact group (which for a compact group is just its representation ring) has culminated in two fundamental conjectures, which are closely related to quantum theory and index theory, namely the Baum–Connes conjecture and the Guillemin–Sternberg conjecture. Although these conjectures were both formulated in 1982, and turn out to be closely related, so far there has been no interplay between them whatsoever, either mathematically or sociologically. This is presumably because the Baum–Connes conjecture is nontrivial only for noncompact groups, with current emphasis entirely on discrete groups, whereas the Guillemin–Sternberg conjecture has so far only been stated for compact Lie groups. As an elementary introduction to both conjectures in one go, indicating how the latter can be generalized to the noncompact case, this paper is a modest attempt to change this state of affairs.",N.

1218,Contribution to the mathematical theory of mass behavior: I. The propagation of single acts,"The propagation of a single act in a large population is supposed to depend on some external circumstance and on an “imitation component”, where encounters with individuals who are performing or have already performed the act contribute to the tendency of an individual to perform it. The “tendency” to perform is supposed to be measured by the average frequency of stimuli, randomly distributed in time, impinging on the individual. The deduced equation is a relation between the fraction of the population who have performed the act and time, provided the time course of the “external circumstance” and the way in which the imitation component contributes are known. Several special cases are studied, in particular, cases without the imitation component, cases with imitation only, and various mixed cases. Examples are given of social situations in which such factors may operate and general suggestions are made for the systematization of observations and/or experiments to test the assumptions of the theory.",Anatol Rapoport,The bulletin of mathematical biophysics,1952,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02477715,"Biophysics Volume,Inherent Tendency,External Circumstance,Mass Behavior,General Suggestion"

With a generalized Argument principle we describe orders of isolated a-points of a monogenic function. We prove a generalized version of Rouché’s theorem. Further, we observe that the generalized elliptic functions in Clifford analysis play a special role with respect to value distributional questions. In particular, we discuss analogs to the classical Liouville theorems. The Argument principle will be exploited to show that the sum of the orders of all isolated a-points of a generalized elliptic function that has only isolated poles vanishes.

1229,Numerical Bifurcation Theory for High-Dimensional Neural Models,"Numerical bifurcation theory involves finding and then following certain types of solutions of differential equations as parameters are varied, and determining whether they undergo any bifurcations (qualitative changes in behaviour). The primary technique for doing this is numerical continuation, where the solution of interest satisfies a parametrised set of algebraic equations, and branches of solutions are followed as the parameter is varied. An effective way to do this is with pseudo-arclength continuation. We give an introduction to pseudo-arclength continuation and then demonstrate its use in investigating the behaviour of a number of models from the field of computational neuroscience. The models we consider are high dimensional, as they result from the discretisation of neural field models—nonlocal differential equations used to model macroscopic pattern formation in the cortex. We consider both stationary and moving patterns in one spatial dimension, and then translating patterns in two spatial dimensions.

The central part of the work is a review of the work of the author and his colleagues and disciples. It highlights boundary and initial-boundary value problems for nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, as well as periodic parabolic problems, which are widely used in applications and are called reaction–diffusion and reaction–diffusion–advection equations. These problems can be interpreted as models in chemical kinetics, synergetics, astrophysics, biology, and other fields. The solutions of these problems often have both narrow boundary regions of rapid change and inner layers of various types (contrasting structures, moving interior layers: fronts), which leads to the need to develop new asymptotic methods in order to study them both formally and rigorously. A general scheme for a rigorous study of contrast structures in singularly perturbed problems for partial differential equations, based on the use of the asymptotic method of differential inequalities, is presented and illustrated on relevant problems. The main achievements of this line of studies of partial differential equations are reflected, and the key directions of its development are indicated.",N. N.

1235,Nevanlinna Theory for Jackson Difference Operators and Entire Solutions of q-Difference Equations,"This paper has two purposes. One is to establish a version of Nevanlinna theory based on the historic so-called Jackson difference operator \({D_q}f(z) = {{f(qz) - f(z)} \over {qz - z}}\) for meromorphic functions of zero order in the complex plane ℂ. We give the logarithmic difference lemma, the second fundamental theorem, the defect relation, Picard theorem, five-value theorem and Wiman-Valiron theorem in sense of Jackson q-difference operator, which keep consistent with the classical Nevanlinna theory. The other is, by using this theory, to investigate entire solutions of linear q-difference equations concerning Jackson difference operators. We will study the growth of entire solutions of linear Jackson q-difference equations \(D_q^kf(z) + A(z)f(z) = 0\) with meromorphic coefficient A, where \(D_q^k\) is Jackson k-th order difference operator, and then to estimate the logarithmic order of some q-special functions. Further, we show that the growth of order of all admissible meromorphic solutions f of a general linear nonhomogeneous q-difference equations \({A_n}(z)D_q^nf(z) + \cdots + {A_1}(z){D_q}f(z) + {A_0}(z)f(z) = F(z)\) should be positive if δ (0, f) > 0.","T.

Certain inconsistencies resulting from the classical procedure of using stoichiometric “chemical equations” to represent the kinds of mechanisms involved are pointed out and remedies are suggested by the introduction of set-theoretic notation within the framework of a so-calledMolecular Set Theory. It is concluded that whereas ordinary algebra is a suitable basis for stoichiometry, in discussing mechanisms of chemical reactions,molecular set theory is more appropriate. This is a theory of material transformations which is patterned afterabstract set theory: the individual molecules of a chemical species and chemical transformations from one species to another correspond to the abstract concepts of elements or points of a set and their mappings into other sets respectively.

A general solution form is proposed as a generalized Papkovich–Neuber representation for the plane problem of the theory of elasticity of an orthotropic body. This representation allows us to write the general solution in displacements through two vector potentials satisfying the generalized harmonic equations. The dependences between the vector potentials of Papkovich–Neuber and the stress function are presented. It is shown that there is a complex-valued solution form through four analytic functions of complex variables associated with coefficients that are the roots of the characteristic equation corresponding to the generalized biharmonic equation. It is proved the statement that the operator of the problem is written only through conjugate analytic functions of complex variables, and the general solution is written through arbitrary linear combinations of four functions of complex variables. A general form of solutions with a given singularities is presented, including representations for both cracks in Mode I and cracks in Mode II. The conditions are analyzed that make it possible to obtain generalized non-singular solutions for cracks of Mode I and II.

1250,Einstein’s Investigations of Galilean Covariant Electrodynamics Prior to 1905,"Einstein learned from the magnet and conductor thought experiment how to use field transformation laws to extend the covariance of Maxwell’s electrodynamics. If he persisted in his use of this device, he would have found that the theory cleaves into two Galilean covariant parts, each with different field transformation laws. The tension between the two parts reflects a failure not mentioned by Einstein: that the relativity of motion manifested by observables in the magnet and conductor thought experiment does not extend to all observables in electrodynamics. An examination of Ritz’s work shows that Einstein’s early view could not have coincided with Ritz’s on an emission theory of light, but only with that of a conveniently reconstructed Ritz. One Ritz-like emission theory, attributed by Pauli to Ritz, proves to be a natural extension of the Galilean covariant part of Maxwell’s theory that happens also to accommodate the magnet and conductor thought experiment. Einstein’s famous chasing a light beam thought experiment fails as an objection to an ether-based, electrodynamical theory of light. However it would allow Einstein to formulate his general objections to all emission theories of light in a very sharp form. Einstein found two well known experimental results of 18th and 19th century optics compelling (Fizeau’s experiment, stellar aberration), while the accomplished Michelson-Morley experiment played no memorable role. I suggest they owe their importance to their providing a direct experimental grounding for Lorentz‘ local time, the precursor of Einstein’s relativity of simultaneity, and doing it essentially independently of electrodynamical theory. I attribute Einstein’s success to his determination to implement a principle of relativity in electrodynamics, but I urge that we not invest this stubbornness with any mystical prescience.",John D.

1258,1-Bit compressive sensing: Reformulation and RRSP-based sign recovery theory,"Recently, the 1-bit compressive sensing (1-bit CS) has been studied in the field of sparse signal recovery. Since the amplitude information of sparse signals in 1-bit CS is not available, it is often the support or the sign of a signal that can be exactly recovered with a decoding method. We first show that a necessary assumption (that has been overlooked in the literature) should be made for some existing theories and discussions for 1-bit CS. Without such an assumption, the found solution by some existing decoding algorithms might be inconsistent with 1-bit measurements. This motivates us to pursue a new direction to develop uniform and nonuniform recovery theories for 1-bit CS with a new decoding method which always generates a solution consistent with 1-bit measurements. We focus on an extreme case of 1-bit CS, in which the measurements capture only the sign of the product of a sensing matrix and a signal. We show that the 1-bit CS model can be reformulated equivalently as an ℓ
0-minimization problem with linear constraints. This reformulation naturally leads to a new linear-program-based decoding method, referred to as the 1-bit basis pursuit, which is remarkably different from existing formulations. It turns out that the uniqueness condition for the solution of the 1-bit basis pursuit yields the so-called restricted range space property (RRSP) of the transposed sensing matrix. This concept provides a basis to develop sign recovery conditions for sparse signals through 1-bit measurements. We prove that if the sign of a sparse signal can be exactly recovered from 1-bit measurements with 1-bit basis pursuit, then the sensing matrix must admit a certain RRSP, and that if the sensing matrix admits a slightly enhanced RRSP, then the sign of a k-sparse signal can be exactly recovered with 1-bit basis pursuit.",YunBin Zhao1 & ChunLei Xu,Science China Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-016-5153-2,"1-bit compressive sensing,restricted range space property,1-bit basis pursuit,linear program,

In order to assure temporal correctness it is necessary that the resources be scheduled to meet the temporal requirements of applications. When we consider the problem of nonpreemptive scheduling of a set of tasks in a processor for which no feasible solution exists, some tasks may have to be rejected so that a schedule can be generated for the rest. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating an optimal schedule such that the number of rejected tasks is minimized, and then the finish time is minimized for the accepted tasks. We propose to use an analytic approach to solve this problem. We first discuss the super sequence based technique which was originally proposed for reducing the search space in testing the feasibility of a task set. Then we show by the Conformation theorem that the super sequence constructed from the task set also provides a valid and reduced search space for the optimization problem. While the complexity of our scheduling algorithm in the worst case remains exponential, our simulation results show that the cost is reasonable for the average case.",Shyh-In Hwang1 & Sheng-Tzong Cheng,Journal of Combinatorial Optimization,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1011449311477,"real-time scheduling,leading theorem,dominance theorem,conformation theorem"

In particular, the approach presented here allows us to translate known regularity results of the elliptic theory directly into regularity results for the parabolic solutions. On the one hand, our theory recaptures known regularity results of the parabolic solutions over smooth spatial domains. On the other hand, however, our theory also covers the case of conical spatial domains, for which the standard assumption ofC
∞-boundaries is violated by suitable application of recent relevant results of elliptic theory for such domains.

1267,The vibration spectra of crystals and the theory of their specific heats,"The enumeration of wave-patterns within an enclosure on a scale of wave-lengths or frequencies presupposes that the waves are perfectly undamped and that the enclosure is perfectly reflecting. In any material medium, however, wave-propagation is necessarily damped and such damping may be so enormous as altogether to preclude wave-propagation. It follows that it is not permissible to identify the modes of atomic vibration in crystals with wave-patterns. Since the specific heat theories of Debye and of Born-Karman are based on such identification, they cannot be sustained.For any mechanical model to represent the dynamic behaviour of a crystal, it is necessary that it should satisfy the requirements for dynamic similarity. When these requirements are satisfied, the behaviour of the model does not support the ideas underlying the Debye and Born-Karman theories, but on the other hand agrees with the results of the theory of the dynamics of crystal lattices put forward by the writer in 1943.The phenomena of light-scattering observed in crystals are also discussed and it is shown that the experimental facts are incompatible with the ideas underlying the Born-Karman theory.",C.

We introduce the notion of F-conjugate plane for each conjugate instant; the restriction of the spacetime metric to the F-conjugate plane is used to compute the Maslov index, which is given by a sort of algebraic count of the conjugate instants. For a stationary Lorentzian manifold and an exact electromagnetic field admitting a potential vector field preserving the flow of the Killing vector field, we introduce a constrained action functional having finite Morse index and whose critical points are fixed endpoints solution of the Lorentz force equation.

1287,Decomposition theory for multidisciplinary design optimization problems with mixed integer quasiseparable subsystems,"Numerous hierarchical and nonhierarchical decomposition strategies for the optimization of large scale systems, comprised of interacting subsystems, have been proposed. With a few exceptions, all of these strategies are essentially heuristic in nature. Recent work considered a class of optimization problems, called quasiseparable, narrow enough for a rigorous decomposition theory, yet general enough to encompass many large scale engineering design problems. The subsystems for these problems involve local design variables and global system variables, but no variables from other subsystems. The objective function is a sum of a global system criterion and the subsystems’ criteria. The essential idea is to give each subsystem a budget and global system variable values, and then ask the subsystems to independently maximize their constraint margins. Using these constraint margins, a system optimization then adjusts the values of the system variables and subsystem budgets. The subsystem margin problems are totally independent, always feasible, and could even be done asynchronously in a parallel computing context. An important detail is that the subsystem tasks, in practice, would be to construct response surface approximations to the constraint margin functions, and the system level optimization would use these margin surrogate functions. The present paper extends the quasiseparable necessary conditions for continuous variables to include discrete subsystem variables, although the continuous necessary and sufficient conditions do not extend to include integer variables.",Raphael T.

Not exhausting the entire subject, it reflects basic ideas and methods of the theory. The Introduction gives an idea of the origins of the basic notions, contents, methods, and problems both of the classical (in the spirit of Kelly) and of the general theory of bitopological spaces. The classical theory is described rather schematically in Chapter I, only the theory of extensions of topological and bitopological spaces and the theory of completion of uniform spaces are presented in more detail. The main focus is on the general theory of bitopological spaces (Chapter II). Notions, methods, and results presented here have no analogues in the classical theory. As applications, foundations of the theory of bitopological manifolds, in particular, bitopologically represented piecewise linear manifolds (Chapter III), and the foundations of the theory of bitopological groups are presented (Chapter IV).",A.

1291,Francis Hauksbee's theory of electricity,"Historians of science have usually assumed that the science of electricity developed in the period prior to Franklin, or at least prior to Nollet, in what amounted to a theoretical vacuum. It has been my aim in this paper to demonstrate the falsity of that assumption. I have shown, I hope, that Hauksbee's important researches were guided throughout by strong theoretical considerations, and I have indicated that Dufay's even more important studies were guided by exactly the same considerations. Nor was their theory in any sense a stagnant one. As it was developed by Hauksbee, it could give a fairly adequate explanation of almost all the known electrical phenomena; it even enabled him to predict the outcome of experiments such as the one involving the rubbing of a globe while it was positioned near a second, exhausted, globe. With the discovery of so many new phenomena in the 1730's, the theory turned out to be no longer adequate, but it is not at all surprising that it was a few years before the full extent of its inadequacies was appreciated, nor is it surprising that a strong continuity is evident between it and the theory which eventually replaced it. In the meantime, the theory continued to serve a useful function by suggesting new lines of research to its adherents. The theory functioned, then, in the same way as any other scientific theory, and it deserves a more serious treatment than it has usually received.

In the present paper, we solve the inverse problem for i = 2: given the parameters of a strongly regular graph Γ2, we find the intersection array of a distance-regular graph Γ of diameter 3. It is proved that Γ2 is not a graph in the half case. We also refine Nirova’s results on distance-regular graphs Γ of diameter 3 for which Γ2 and Γ3 are strongly regular.

n by an ordering generated by a convex cone. Two new classes of operators are introduced, each of which is used to guarantee the existence of a solution to the generalized problem. The new classes can be seen to be broader than previously studied classes. In addition, conditions are presented under which the solution set of the generalized linear complementarity problem is shown to have at most a finite number of solutions.",G. J. Habetler1 & A. L.

1319,Finite axiomatizability of local set theory,"The need for modifying axiomatic set theories was caused, in particular, by the development of category theory. The ZF and NBG axiomatic theories turned out to be unsuitable for defining the notion of a model of category theory. The point is that there are constructions such as the category of categories in naïve category theory, while constructions like the set of sets are strongly restricted in the ZF and NBG axiomatic theories. Thus, it was required, on the one hand, to restrict constructions similar to the category of categories and, on the other hand, adapt axiomatic set theory in order to give a definition of a category which survives restricted construction similar to the category of categories. This task was accomplished by promptly inventing the axiom of universality (AU) asserting that each set is an element of a universal set closed under all NBG constructions. Unfortunately, in the theories ZF + AU and NBG + AU, there are toomany universal sets (as many as the number of all ordinals), whereas to solve the problem stated above, a countable collection of universal sets would suffice. For this reason, in 2005, the first-named author introduced local-minimal set theory, which preserves the axiom AU of universality and has an at most countable collection of universal sets. This was achieved at the expense of rejecting the global replacement axiom and using the local replacement axiom for each universal class instead. Local-minimal set theory has 14 axioms and one axiom scheme (of comprehension). It is shown that this axiom scheme can be replaced by finitely many axioms that are special cases of the comprehension scheme. The proof follows Bernays’ scheme with significant modifications required by the presence of the restricted predicativity condition on the formula in the comprehension axiom scheme.",V. K.

1320,"Perturbation theory and backward error forAX−XB=C
","Because of the special structure of the equationsAX−XB=C the usual relation for linear equations “backward error = relative residual” does not hold, and application of the standard perturbation result forAx=b yields a perturbation bound involving sep (A, B)−1 that is not always attainable. An expression is derived for the backward error of an approximate solutionY; it shows that the backward error can exceed the relative residual by an arbitrary factor. A sharp perturbation bound is derived and it is shown that the condition number it defines can be arbitrarily smaller than the sep(A, B)−1-based quantity that is usually used to measure sensitivity. For practical error estimation using the residual of a computed solution an “LAPACK-style” bound is shown to be efficiently computable and potentially much smaller than a sep-based bound. A Fortran 77 code has been written that solves the Sylvester equation and computes this bound, making use of LAPACK routines.",Nicholas J.

We use the data from the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery to test this theory. We find that, as prediced by theory, areas with higher monetary and non-monetary costs have consistently higher catch rates than areas with lower costs. We show that this theory also predicts that an increase in price would result in an overall increase in catch rate, and suggest that in fisheries with spatial variation in costs, catch rates may be determined as much by economic factors as biological ones.",Ray Hilborn1 & Robert B.

In order to reduce the problem from then-dimensional number space to the space of (n-1) degrees of freedom, a certain type of orthogonal transformations is introduced, through which the reduction can be made symmetrically with respect to then kinds. For applications of this transformation (i) when the Malthusian parameter of then kinds of replicons are Gaussian stationary process, the multidimensional probability density of replicon frequencies is obtained, together with a ‘diffusion equation’ satisfied by the density function, and (ii) a necessary and sufficient condition is derived from the global stability of the linkage equilibrium in a general two-locus two-allele model.","Morihiro Notohara1, Kazushige Ishii1 & Hirotsugu Matsuda",Journal of Mathematical Biology,1978,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02547800,"Population genetics,Transformation of state space"

I,"This paper extends the Alternative to Morse–Novikov theory we have proposed in Burghelea (New topological invariants for real- and angle-valued maps, Word Scientific, Hackensack, 2018) from real- and angle-valued maps to closed 1-forms. For a topological closed 1-form \(\omega \) on a compact ANR (\(=\) absolute neighborhood retract) X, a concept generalizing closed differential 1-form on a compact manifold, under the mild hypothesis of tameness, a field \(\kappa \) and a non-negative integer r, we propose two configurations \(\varvec{\delta }^\omega _r{:}\,\mathbb {R}\rightarrow \mathbb {Z}_{\geqslant 0}\) and  which recover Novikov–Betti numbers and the Novikov complex associated with a Morse closed 1-form with non-degenerated zeros. Precisely, the sum of the multiplicities of the points in the support of \(\varvec{\delta }^\omega _r\) equals the rth Novikov–Betti number and that of the points in the support of \(\varvec{\gamma }^\omega _r\) equals the rank of the boundary map in the Novikov complex. We formulate the basic properties of these configurations, the stability and the Poincaré duality when X is a \(\kappa \)-orientable closed topological manifold, which in full generality will be proven in the second part of this work.","Dan Burghelea

1329,Necessity of Social Distancing in Pandemic Control: A Dynamic Game Theory Approach,"We model a society with two types of citizens: healthy and vulnerable individuals. While both types can be exposed to the virus and contribute to its spread, the vulnerable people tend to be more cautious as being exposed to the virus can be fatal for them due to their conditions, e.g., advanced age or prior medical conditions. We assume that both types would like to participate in in-person social activities as freely as possible and they make this decision based on the total number of infected people in the society. In this model, we assume that a local governmental authority imposes and administers social distancing regulations based on the infection status of the society and revises it accordingly in each time period. We model and solve for the steady state in four scenarios: (i) non-cooperative (Nash), (ii) cooperative, (iii) egoistic, and (iv) altruistic. The results show that the Altruistic scenario is the best among the four, i.e., the healthy citizens put the vulnerable citizens’ needs first and self-isolate more strictly which results in more flexibility for the vulnerable citizens. We use a numerical example to illustrate that the Altruistic scenario will assist with pandemic control for both healthy and vulnerable citizens in the long run. The objective of this research is not to find a way to resolve the pandemic but to optimally live in a society which has been impacted by pandemic restrictions, similar to what was experienced in 2020 with the spread of COVID-19.","Ilyass Dahmouni

1345,Geometric singular perturbation theory analysis of an epidemic model with spontaneous human behavioral change,"We consider a model due to Piero Poletti and collaborators that adds spontaneous human behavioral change to the standard SIR epidemic model. In its simplest form, the Poletti model adds one differential equation, motivated by evolutionary game theory, to the SIR model. The new equation describes the evolution of a variable x that represents the fraction of the population following normal behavior. The remaining fraction \(1-x\) uses altered behavior such as staying home, social isolation, mask wearing, etc. Normal behavior offers a higher payoff when the number of infectives is low; altered behavior offers a higher payoff when the number is high. We show that the entry–exit function of geometric singular perturbation theory can be used to analyze the model in the limit in which behavior changes on a much faster time scale than that of the epidemic. In particular, behavior does not change as soon as a different behavior has a higher payoff; current behavior is sticky. The delay until behavior changes is predicted by the entry–exit function.","Stephen Schecter

1354,Copula theory approach to stochastic geometric programming,"In this research, stochastic geometric programming with joint chance constraints is investigated with elliptically distributed random parameters. The constraint’s random coefficient vectors are considered dependent, and the dependence of the random vectors is handled through copulas. Moreover, Archimedean copulas are used to derive the random rows distribution. A convex approximation optimization problem is proposed for this class of stochastic geometric programming problems using a standard variable transformation. Furthermore, a piecewise tangent approximation and sequential convex approximation are employed to obtain the lower and upper bounds for the convex optimization model, respectively. Finally, an illustrative optimization example on randomly generated data is presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the methods and algorithms.","Rashed Khanjani-Shiraz1, Salman Khodayifar2 & Panos M.

We also prove that, under suitable conditions, a set defined through a Horn theory in a set \(\mathfrak {A}\) is recursively enumerable in models of the above mentioned recursion theories.","Juan A.

1356,Random Triangle Theory with Geometry and Applications,"What is the probability that a random triangle is acute? We explore this old question from a modern viewpoint, taking into account linear algebra, shape theory, numerical analysis, random matrix theory, the Hopf fibration, and much more. One of the best distributions of random triangles takes all six vertex coordinates as independent standard Gaussians. Six can be reduced to four by translation of the center to \((0,0)\) or reformulation as a \(2\times 2\) random matrix problem. In this note, we develop shape theory in its historical context for a wide audience. We hope to encourage others to look again (and differently) at triangles. We provide a new constructive proof, using the geometry of parallelians, of a central result of shape theory: triangle shapes naturally fall on a hemisphere. We give several proofs of the key random result: that triangles are uniformly distributed when the normal distribution is transferred to the hemisphere. A new proof connects to the distribution of random condition numbers. Generalizing to higher dimensions, we obtain the “square root ellipticity statistic” of random matrix theory. Another proof connects the Hopf map to the SVD of \(2\times 2\) matrices. A new theorem describes three similar triangles hidden in the hemisphere. Many triangle properties are reformulated as matrix theorems, providing insight into both. This paper argues for a shift of viewpoint to the modern approaches of random matrix theory. As one example, we propose that the smallest singular value is an effective test for uniformity. New software is developed, and applications are proposed.",Alan Edelman1 & Gilbert Strang,Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-015-9250-3,"Random triangle,Triangle space,Shape theory,Hopf fibration,Random matrix,Lewis Carroll"

In particular, given an elliptic curve E over \(\mathbb {Q}\) with supersingular reduction at a prime \(p\ge 5\), we prove results on the \(\Lambda \)-corank of certain plus/minus p-primary Selmer groups à la Kobayashi of E over the anticyclotomic \(\mathbb {Z}_p\)-extension of an imaginary quadratic field and on the asymptotic behaviour of p-primary Selmer groups of E when the base field varies over the finite layers of such a \(\mathbb {Z}_p\)-extension. These theorems can be alternatively obtained by combining results of Nekovář, Vatsal and Iovita–Pollack, but do not seem to be directly available in the current literature.","Matteo Longo1 & Stefano Vigni

1361,Towards a new theory of confirmation,Any sequence of events can be “explained” by any of an infinite number of hypotheses. Popper describes the “logic of discovery” as a process of choosing from a hierarchy of hypotheses the first hypothesis which is not at variance with the observed facts. Blum and Blum formalized these hierarchies of hypotheses as hierarchies of infinite binary sequences and imposed on them certain decidability conditions. In this paper we also consider hierarchies of infinite binary sequences but we impose only the most elementary Bayesian considerations. We use the structure of such hierarchies to define “confirmation”. We then suggest a definition of probability based on the amount of confirmation a particular hypothesis (i.e. pattern) has received. We show that hypothesis confirmation alone is a sound basis for determining probabilities and in particular that Carnap’s logical and empirical criteria for determining probabilities are consequences of the confirmation criterion in appropriate limiting cases.,Moshe Koppel,Israel Journal of Mathematics,1985,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02761402,"Boolean Function,Initial Segment,Binary String,Inference Method,Total Evidence"

This paper explores these seemingly quiet years when Artin immigrated to America and disseminated ideas about algebraic number theory during this time in his collaboration with George Whaples, a young American mathematician who had just completed his Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin. The main result of their work is the use of the product formula for valuations to come up with an axiomatic characterization of both algebraic number fields and algebraic function fields with a finite field of constants. These two families of fields are exactly the fields for which class field theory is known to hold.

In Levinson (One-dimensional Schubert problems with respect to osculating flags, 2016, doi:10.4153/CJM-2015-061-1), it was shown that the real geometry of these curves is described by the orbits of a map \(\omega \) on skew tableaux, defined as the commutator of jeu de taquin rectification and promotion. In particular, the real locus of the Schubert curve is naturally a covering space of \({\mathbb {RP}}^1\), with \(\omega \) as the monodromy operator. We provide a fast, local algorithm for computing \(\omega \) without rectifying the skew tableau and show that certain steps in our algorithm are in bijective correspondence with Pechenik and Yong’s genomic tableaux (Pechenik and Yong in Genomic tableaux, 2016. arXiv:1603.08490), which enumerate the K-theoretic Littlewood–Richardson coefficient associated to the Schubert curve.

When the matroid is realizable by a complex hyperplane arrangement, our invariants coincide with virtual fundamental classes used to define the logarithmic Gromov–Witten theory of wonderful models of arrangement complements, for any logarithmic structure supported on the wonderful boundary. When the boundary is empty, this implies that the quantum cohomology ring of a hyperplane arrangement’s wonderful model is a combinatorial invariant, i.e., it depends only on the matroid. When the boundary divisor is maximal, we use toric intersection theory to convert the virtual fundamental class into a balanced weighted fan in a vector space, having the expected dimension. We explain how the associated Gromov–Witten theory is completely encoded by intersections with this weighted fan.

1383,"Information Theory in Living Systems, Methods, Applications, and Challenges","Living systems are distinguished in nature by their ability to maintain stable, ordered states far from equilibrium. This is despite constant buffeting by thermodynamic forces that, if unopposed, will inevitably increase disorder. Cells maintain a steep transmembrane entropy gradient by continuous application of information that permits cellular components to carry out highly specific tasks that import energy and export entropy. Thus, the study of information storage, flow and utilization is critical for understanding first principles that govern the dynamics of life. Initial biological applications of information theory (IT) used Shannon’s methods to measure the information content in strings of monomers such as genes, RNA, and proteins. Recent work has used bioinformatic and dynamical systems to provide remarkable insights into the topology and dynamics of intracellular information networks. Novel applications of Fisher-, Shannon-, and Kullback–Leibler informations are promoting increased understanding of the mechanisms by which genetic information is converted to work and order. Insights into evolution may be gained by analysis of the the fitness contributions from specific segments of genetic information as well as the optimization process in which the fitness are constrained by the substrate cost for its storage and utilization. Recent IT applications have recognized the possible role of nontraditional information storage structures including lipids and ion gradients as well as information transmission by molecular flux across cell membranes. Many fascinating challenges remain, including defining the intercellular information dynamics of multicellular organisms and the role of disordered information storage and flow in disease.","Robert A.

The topics touched on in the correspondence are: the proof of the central limit theorem of probability theory, von Mises' notion of randomness, and a statistical criterion for integer-valuedness of physical data. The investigation will hint at both the fruitfulness and the limits of several of von Mises' notions such as ``collective'', ``distribution'' and ``complex adjuncts'' (characteristic functions) for further developments in probability theory and in ``directional statistics''. By pointing to the selectiveness of Pólya's criticism, the historical analysis shows the differing expectations of the two men with respect to the further development of the theory of probability and its applications. The paper thus gives a glimpse of the provisional state of the theory around 1920, before others such as P. Lévy (1886–1971) and A. N.

Due to the default of augmentation, the objects of the dual category are endowed with a curvature. As usual, the bar–cobar construction gives a cofibrant resolution for any properad. Applied to the properad encoding unital and counital Frobenius algebras, notion which appears in 2d-TQFT, it defines the associated notion up to homotopy. We further define a curved Koszul duality theory for operads or properads presented with quadratic, linear and constant relations. This provides smaller resolutions. We apply this new theory to study the homotopy theory and the cohomology theory of unital associative algebras.",Joseph Hirsh1 & Joan Millès,Mathematische Annalen,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00208-011-0766-9,"18D50,18G10"
1388,The Zero-Removing Property in Hilbert Spaces of Entire Functions Arising in Sampling Theory,"In the topic of sampling in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, sampling in Paley–Wiener spaces is the paradigmatic example. A natural generalization of Paley–Wiener spaces is obtained by substituting the Fourier kernel with an analytic Hilbert-space-valued kernel K. Thus we obtain a reproducing kernel Hilbert space \({\mathcal{H}_{K}}\) of entire functions in which the Kramer property allows to prove a sampling theorem. A necessary and sufficient condition ensuring that this sampling formula can be written as a Lagrange-type interpolation series concerns the stability under removal of a finite number of zeros of the functions belonging to the space \({\mathcal{H}_{K}}\); this is the so-called zero-removing property. This work is devoted to the study of the zero-removing property in \({\mathcal{H}_{K}}\) spaces, regardless of the Kramer property, revealing its connections with other mathematical fields.",A. G.

It is shown how such strategies are a subset of the equilibrium solutions for a particular non-zero sum game. These equilibrium solutions are then shown to arise from the vertices of a particular convex polyhedron. A method of finding these equilibrium solutions through the vertices and then the ESS solutions is given. This is illustrated by a number of numerical examples taken from the literature.

1392,An inverse prospect theory-based algorithm in extended incomplete additive probabilistic linguistic preference relation environment and its application in financial products selection,"Selecting financial products is one of the most fundamental investment activities to both individuals and companies, and therefore it is very important to establish an efficient and practical method for financial products selection. To address the challenge of the complicated decision-making environment and decision makers’ expression habits for the selection of financial products, this paper develops the incomplete additive probabilistic linguistic preference relation to depict decision makers’ preferences. Considering that, when decision makers express their opinions using probabilistic linguistic preference relation, it is possible that the sum of the value of the probability information is more than 1, this paper also extends the concepts of probabilistic linguistic term set, additive probabilistic linguistic preference relation and incomplete additive probabilistic linguistic preference relation to improve and ensure their practicability. Moreover, an “inverse prospect theory-based” algorithm is proposed to choose proper financial products. The algorithm processes the original incomplete additive probabilistic linguistic preference relation by using the inverse functions of the prospect theory at first. Then, a priority weights deriving model is established based on the extended concepts. Finally, the numerical case and analysis is presented as the evidences to the conclusion that the proposed algorithm is practical and robust.","Nana Liu1, Zeshui Xu1, Yue He3 & …Xiao-Jun Zeng",Fuzzy Optimization and Decision Making,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10700-020-09348-3,"Financial products selection,Extended probabilistic linguistic term set,Extended incomplete additive probabilistic linguistic preference relation,Inverse prospect theory"

These polynomials are the familiar boson polynomials that appeared in earlier work, but are now presented from a new viewpoint. The main results are (1) the proof that these same polynomials provide a basis for all U (n) irreducible tensor operators when the commuting indeterminates are replaced by non-commuting fundamental unit tensor operators, and (2) the construction of all sets of unit tensor operators whose matrix elements give U (n) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients that possess the null space required by the Littlewood-Richardson numbers. Recent advances in the combinatorial interpretations of some of these results are pointed out. An outline is given of how the factorial Schur functions were discovered during the investigation of the properties of certain polynomials that characterize the null space of U (3) tensor operators.",James D.

1395,Zonoid theory and Hilbert's fourth problem,A finite vector sum of line segments is termed a zonotope. A zonoid is a Blaschke-Hausdorff limit of zonotopes. A projective metric d on a convex subset of projective space is shown to be of negative type if and only if the spheres in any tangent space are polar duals of zonoids. It follows that metric arclength can be represented by a Crofton formula with respect to a positive measure on the hyperplanes if and only if d is of negative type. These ideas allow a nice characterization of this cone of metrics.,Ralph Alexander,Geometriae Dedicata,1988,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00147451,"Line Segment,Convex Subset,Projective Space,Tangent Space,Positive Measure"

The problem to be solved is changed to a set of infinite algebraic equations by an orthogonal function expansion method. As examples, under free boundary conditions, the numerical results of the dynamic moment concentration factors in the plates with two circular holes are computed. The results indicate that the parameters such as the incident wave number, the thickness of plates, and the spacing between holes have great effects on the dynamic stress distributions. The results are accurate because the refined equation is derived without any engineering hypothese.","Chuan-ping Zhou

In this work, we focus on the problem of expressing with a closed formula multivariate monotone cumulants in terms of free and Boolean cumulants. In the process, we introduce various constructions and statistics on non-crossing partitions. Our approach is based on a pre-Lie algebra structure on cumulant functionals.

One corresponds to fluctuations in physical parameters suggestive of a neurological basis, and the other corresponds to fluctuations in stimulus sample constitution. The two interpretations are shown to be equivalent under rather general conditions, giving the same type of relation between response and training states. This relation is different from that obtained via the response strength concept used in Part I. As a step toward evaluating the difference in predicted behavior for these different response-training relations, a general functional-difference equation is derived that describes the moments of the corresponding stochastic process in experimenter-subject controlled experiments. As an immediate application, it is used to obtain the continuity condition for the solution of the functional equation treated in Part I, and to justify the differentiability conditions assumed in establishing asymptotic properties of the solution as a function of the reinforcement parameter.",H.

1414,Comprehensive Gröbner basis theory for a parametric polynomial ideal and the associated completion algorithm,"Gröbner basis theory for parametric polynomial ideals is explored with the main objective of mimicking the Gröbner basis theory for ideals. Given a parametric polynomial ideal, its basis is a comprehensive Gröbner basis if and only if for every specialization of its parameters in a given field, the specialization of the basis is a Gröbner basis of the associated specialized polynomial ideal. For various specializations of parameters, structure of specialized ideals becomes qualitatively different even though there are significant relationships as well because of finiteness properties. Key concepts foundational to Gröbner basis theory are reexamined and/or further developed for the parametric case: (i) Definition of a comprehensive Gröbner basis, (ii) test for a comprehensive Gröbner basis, (iii) parameterized rewriting, (iv) S-polynomials among parametric polynomials, (v) completion algorithm for directly computing a comprehensive Gröbner basis from a given basis of a parametric ideal. Elegant properties of Gröbner bases in the classical ideal theory, such as for a fixed admissible term ordering, a unique Gröbner basis can be associated with every polynomial ideal as well as that such a basis can be computed from any Gröbner basis of an ideal, turn out to be a major challenge to generalize for parametric ideals; issues related to these investigations are explored.

","This paper establishes isomorphisms for Laplace, biharmonic and Stokes operators in weighted Sobolev spaces. The \(W^{m,p}_{\alpha }({{\mathbb {R}}}^n)\)-spaces are similar to standard Sobolev spaces \(W^{m,p}_{}({\mathbb {R}}^n)\), but they are endowed with weights \((1+|x|^2)^{\alpha /2}\) prescribing functions’ growth or decay at infinity. Although well established in \({{\mathbb {R}}}^n\) [3], these weighted results do not apply in the specific hypothesis of periodicity. This kind of problem appears when studying singularly perturbed domains (roughness, sieves, porous media, etc): when zooming on a single perturbation pattern, one often ends with a periodic problem set on an infinite strip. We present a unified framework that enables a systematic treatment of such problems in the context of periodic strips. We provide existence and uniqueness of solutions in our weighted Sobolev spaces. This gives a refined description of solution’s behavior at infinity which is of importance in the multi-scale context. The isomorphisms are valid for any relative integer m, any p in \((1,\infty )\), and any real \(\alpha \) out of a countable set of critical values for the Stokes, the biharmonic and the Laplace operators.",Vuk Milišić1 & Ulrich Razafison,ANNALI DELL'UNIVERSITA' DI FERRARA,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11565-015-0230-y,"Periodic infinite strip,Weighted Sobolev spaces,Hardy inequality,Isomorphisms,Laplace operator,Stokes equations,Green function,Boundary layers"
1422,Novel decision-making approach based on hesitant fuzzy sets and graph theory,"Hesitant fuzzy set is a powerful and effective tool to express uncertain information in multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) process, as it permits the membership degree of an element to a set represented by several possible values in [0,1]. In this paper, we develop a new decision-making approach based on graph theory to deal with the MADM problems, in which the decision information is expressed by hesitant fuzzy elements. Meanwhile, we generalize this approach to make it suitable for processing interval-valued hesitant fuzzy and hesitant triangular fuzzy information. Moreover, we utilize the numerical examples concerning the energy project selection and software evaluation to show the detailed implementation procedure and reliability of our method in solving MADM problems under hesitant fuzzy, interval-valued hesitant fuzzy and hesitant triangular fuzzy environment.",Sumera Naz1 & Muhammad Akram,Computational and Applied Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-019-0773-0,"Hesitant fuzzy set,Interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set,Hesitant triangular fuzzy set,Graph theory,Expected value"

Trees in this class can be generated by substitution processes. Their spectra are shown to be purely absolutely continuous and to consist of finitely many bands. The main result gives stability of the absolutely continuous spectrum under sufficiently small radially label symmetric perturbations for non-regular trees in this class. In sharp contrast, the absolutely continuous spectrum can be completely destroyed by arbitrary small radially label symmetric perturbations for regular trees in this class.","Matthias Keller1, Daniel Lenz1 & Simone Warzel",Israel Journal of Mathematics,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11856-012-0059-3,"Green Function,Continuous Spectrum,Recursion Relation,Accumulation Point,Recursion Formula"

Our approach is based on combining contour representations from Pirogov–Sinai theory with Barvinok’s approach to approximate counting using truncated Taylor series. Some consequences of our main results include an FPTAS for approximating the partition function of the hard-core model at sufficiently high fugacity on subsets of \(\mathbb {Z}^d\) with appropriate boundary conditions and an efficient sampling algorithm for the ferromagnetic Potts model on the discrete torus \((\mathbb {Z}/n\mathbb {Z})^d\) at sufficiently low temperature.

1427,"The module theory of semisymmetric quasigroups, totally symmetric quasigroups, and triple systems","This paper initiates a unified module theory for four varieties of quasigroups: semisymmetric, semisymmetric idempotent, totally symmetric, and totally symmetric idempotent. These classes correspond, respectively, to extended Mendelsohn triple systems, Mendelsohn triple systems (MTS), extended Steiner triple systems, and Steiner triple systems (STS), which, in turn, correspond to partitions of complete (directed) graphs. Letting \({\mathbf {V}}\) stand for any of the aforementioned quasigroup categories, we determine a ring, \({\mathbb {Z}}{\mathbf {V}}\!{Q}\), such that abelian groups in the slice category \({\mathbf {V}}\!/\!{Q}\) are equivalent to (right) \({\mathbb {Z}}{\mathbf {V}}\!{Q}\)-modules. This ring is a quotient of the group algebra of the so-called universal stabilizer of the \({\mathbf {V}}\)-quasigroup Q. We prove that the universal stabilizer of Q in \({\mathbf {V}}\) is the fundamental group of either the graph from which the triple system sources its blocks, or a closely related space. In each of the four varieties, we provide a free product description of \({\mathbb {Z}}{\mathbf {V}}\!{Q}\), and show that the factorizations are indexed by blocks of the triple system. We also consider the ranks of free group rings that appear in the coproduct for \({\mathbb {Z}}{\mathbf {V}}\!{Q}\) (for the cases \({\mathbf {V}}=\mathbf {MTS}, \mathbf {STS}\)), and we describe these ranks in terms of pentagonal numbers. We establish a relationship between the module theory of MTS and commutative Moufang loops of exponent 3. As an application, we show how the MTS module theory completely accounts for the distributive, nonmedial quasigroups of order 81.","Alex W. Nowak

1429,"A mixture theory model of fluid and solute transport in the microvasculature of normal and malignant tissues. II: Factor sensitivity analysis, calibration, and validation","The treatment of cancerous tumors is dependent upon the delivery of therapeutics through the blood by means of the microcirculation. Differences in the vasculature of normal and malignant tissues have been recognized, but it is not fully understood how these differences affect transport and the applicability of existing mathematical models has been questioned at the microscale due to the complex rheology of blood and fluid exchange with the tissue. In addition to determining an appropriate set of governing equations it is necessary to specify appropriate model parameters based on physiological data. To this end, a two stage sensitivity analysis is described which makes it possible to determine the set of parameters most important to the model’s calibration. In the first stage, the fluid flow equations are examined and a sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the importance of 11 different model parameters. Of these, only four substantially influence the intravascular axial flow providing a tractable set that could be calibrated using red blood cell velocity data from the literature. The second stage also utilizes a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the importance of 14 model parameters on extravascular flux. Of these, six exhibit high sensitivity and are integrated into the model calibration using a response surface methodology and experimental intra- and extravascular accumulation data from the literature (Dreher et al. in J Natl Cancer Inst 98(5):335–344, 2006). The model exhibits good agreement with the experimental results for both the mean extravascular concentration and the penetration depth as a function of time for inert dextran over a wide range of molecular weights.","M.

1431,A history of the axiomatic formulation of probability from Borel to Kolmogorov: Part I,"This paper, the first of two, traces the origins of the modern axiomatic formulation of Probability Theory, which was first given in definitive form by Kolmogorov in 1933. Even before that time, however, a sequence of developments, initiated by a landmark paper of E. Borel, were giving rise to problems, theorems, and reformulations that increasingly related probability to measure theory and, in particular, clarified the key role of countable additivity in Probability Theory.This paper describes the developments from Borel's work through F. Hausdorff's. The major accomplishments of the period were Borel's Zero-One Law (also known as the Borel-Cantelli Lemmas), his Strong Law of Large Numbers, and his Continued Fraction Theorem. What is new is a detailed analysis of Borel's original proofs, from which we try to account for the roots (psychological as well as mathematical) of the many flaws and inadequacies in Borel's reasoning. We also document the increasing realization of the link between the theories of measure and of probability in the period from G. Faber to F. Hausdorff. We indicate the misleading emphasis given to independence as a basic concept by Borel and his equally unfortunate association of a Heine-Borel lemma with countable additivity. Also original is the (possible) genesis we propose for each of the two examples chosen by Borel to exhibit his new theory; in each case we cite a now neglected precursor of Borel, one of them surely known to Borel, the other, probably so. The brief sketch of instances of the “Cantelli” lemma before Cantelli's publication is also original.We describe the interesting polemic between F. Bernstein and Borel concerning the Continued Fraction Theorem, which serves as a rare instance of a contemporary criticism of Borel's reasoning. We also discuss Hausdorff's proof of Borel's Strong Law (which seems to be the first valid proof of the theorem along the lines sketched by Borel).In retrospect, one may ask why problems of “geometric” (or “continuous”) probability did not give rise to the (Kolmogorov) view of probability as a form of measure, rather than the study of repeated independent trials, which was Borel's approach. This paper shows that questions of “geometric” probability were always the essential guide to the early development of the theory, despite the contrary viewpoint exhibited by Borel's preferred interpretation of his own results.",Jack Barone1 & Albert Novikoff,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,1978,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00348144,"Detailed Analysis,Probability Theory,Early Development,Basic Concept,Definitive Form"

1437,Finding and classifying critical points of 2D vector fields: a cell-oriented approach using group theory,"We present a novel approach to finding critical points in cell-wise barycentrically or bilinearly interpolated vector fields on surfaces. The Poincaré index of the critical points is determined by investigating the qualitative behavior of 0-level sets of the interpolants of the vector field components in parameter space using precomputed combinatorial results, thus avoiding the computation of the Jacobian of the vector field at the critical points in order to determine its index. The locations of the critical points within a cell are determined analytically to achieve accurate results. This approach leads to a correct treatment of cases with two first-order critical points or one second-order critical point of bilinearly interpolated vector fields within one cell, which would be missed by examining the linearized field only. We show that for the considered interpolation schemes determining the index of a critical point can be seen as a coloring problem of cell edges. A complete classification of all possible colorings in terms of the types and number of critical points yielded by each coloring is given using computational group theory. We present an efficient algorithm that makes use of these precomputed classifications in order to find and classify critical points in a cell-by-cell fashion.

We have expanded the Hamiltonian of the four-planetary problem into the Poisson series in osculating elements of the second Poincare system. The series expansion is constructed up to the third degree of the small parameter. The averaging procedure of the Hamiltonian is performed by the Hori–Deprit method. It allows to eliminate short-periodic perturbations and sufficiently increase time step of the integration of the equations of motion. This method is based on Lie transformation theory. The equations of motion in averaged elements are constructed as the Poisson brackets of the averaged Hamiltonian and corresponding orbital element. The transformation between averaged and osculating elements is given by the change-variable functions, which are obtained in the second approximation of the Hori–Deprit method. We used computer algebra system Piranha for the implementation of the Hori–Deprit method. Piranha is an echeloned Poisson series processor authored by F. Biscani.

The purpose of this article is to present a pair of distinctions that suggest that three kinds of generality are to be found in mathematics and logics, not only at some particular period but especially in developments that take place over time: ‘omnipresent’ and ‘multipresent’ theories, and ‘ubiquitous’ notions that form dependent parts, or moments, of theories. The category of ‘facets’ is also introduced, primarily to assess the roles of diagrams and notations in these two disciplines. Various consequences are explored, starting with means of developing applied mathematics, and then reconsidering several established ways of elaborating or appraising theories, such as analogising, revolutions, abstraction, unification, reduction and axiomatisation. The influence of theories already in place upon theory-building is emphasised. The roles in both mathematics and logics of set theory, abstract algebras, metamathematics, and model theory are assessed, along with the different relationships between the two disciplines adopted in algebraic logic and in mathematical logic. Finally, the issue of monism versus pluralism in these two disciplines is rehearsed, and some suggestions are made about the special character of mathematical and logical knowledge, and also the differences between them. Since the article is basically an exercise in historiography, historical examples and case studies are described or noted throughout.","I.

1452,Phase-locking for dynamical systems on the torus and perturbation theory for mathieu-type problems,"When several oscillators are coupled together and the parameters of their coupling are varied, the oscillators pass through so-called phase-locked regimes. In physical terms this means that the oscillators tend to synchronize their motion. To describe this phenomenon, we frame the concepts ofpartial phase andphase-locking. A partial phase of a toral flow puts emphasis on how orbits of the flow drift around the torus in some fixed direction. The partial phase is locked if it grows in time along some orbit slower than any linear function. When a toral flow is given by a trigonometric polynomial, its phase-locked regions are quite narrow. With the coupling amplitude increasing, each region grows in width as some power of the amplitude. That power can be calculated in terms of both the partial phase and degree of the trigonometric polynomial.",O. G.

This condition consists in that the tangent symplectic transformation to the evolution operator of the nonlinear classical field equation is realized by a unitary transformation of Fock space. It follows from the results of the book of Maslov and Shvedov that this condition always holds.",A. V.

1454,A theory for Nyström methods,"For the numerical solution of differential equations of thesecond order (and systems of ...) there are two possibilities: 1. To transform it into a system of the first order (of doubled dimension) and to integrate by a standard routine. 2. To apply a “direct” method as those invented by Nyström. The benefit of these direct methods is not generally accepted, a historical reason for them was surely the fact that at that time the theories did not consider systems, but single equations only. In any case the second approach is more general, since the class of methods defined in this paper contains the first approach as a special case. So there is more freedom for extending stability or accuracy.This paper begins with the development of a theory, which extends our theory for first order equations [1] to equations of the second order, and which is applicable to the study of possibly all numerical methods for problems of this type. As an application, we obtain Butcher-type results for Nyström-methods, we characterize numerical methods as applications of a certain set of trees, give formulas for a group-structure (expressing the composition of methods) etc.Recently in [2] the equations of conditions for Nyström methods have been tabulated up to order 7 (containing errors). Our approach yields not only the correct equations of conditions in a straight-forward way, but also an insight in the structure of methods that is useful for example in choosing good formulas.", E.

In this paper we consider (global) equivariant generalizations of these filtrations and another closely related class of filtrations, the modified rank filtrations of the K-theory spectra themselves. We lift Arone and Lesh’s description of the filtration subquotients to the equivariant context and apply it to compute algebraic filtrations on representation rings that arise on equivariant homotopy groups. It turns out that these representation ring filtrations are considerably easier to express in a global equivariant context than over a fixed compact Lie group. Furthermore, they have formal similarities to the filtration on Burnside rings induced by the symmetric products of spheres, which was computed by Schwede (J Am Math Soc 30(3):673–711, 2017).",Markus Hausmann1 & Dominik Ostermayr,Mathematische Zeitschrift,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00209-019-02338-1,"K-theory,Global equivariant homotopy theory,Rank filtration,Symmetric products,Representation rings"

A point \({x \in X}\) is a coincidence point of \({\phi}\) and \({\psi}\) if \({\phi(x) \cap \psi(x) \neq \emptyset}\). We define a Nielsen coincidence number \({N(\phi : \psi)}\) which is a lower bound for the number of coincidence points of all (m, n)-valued pairs of maps homotopic to \({(\phi, \psi)}\). We calculate \({N(\phi : \psi)}\) for all (m, n)-valued pairs of maps of the circle and show that \({N(\phi : \psi)}\) is a sharp lower bound in that setting. Specifically, if \({\phi}\) is of degree a and \({\psi}\) of degree b, then \({N(\phi : \psi) = \frac{|an - bm|}{\langle m, n \rangle}}\), where \({\langle m, n \rangle}\) is the greatest common divisor of m and n.

1457,An ordinal analysis for theories of self-referential truth,"The first attempt at a systematic approach to axiomatic theories of truth was undertaken by Friedman and Sheard (Ann Pure Appl Log 33:1–21, 1987). There twelve principles consisting of axioms, axiom schemata and rules of inference, each embodying a reasonable property of truth were isolated for study. Working with a base theory of truth conservative over PA, Friedman and Sheard raised the following questions. Which subsets of the Optional Axioms are consistent over the base theory? What are the proof-theoretic strengths of the consistent theories? The first question was answered completely by Friedman and Sheard; all subsets of the Optional Axioms were classified as either consistent or inconsistent giving rise to nine maximal consistent theories of truth.They also determined the proof-theoretic strength of two subsets of the Optional Axioms. The aim of this paper is to continue the work begun by Friedman and Sheard. We will establish the proof-theoretic strength of all the remaining seven theories and relate their arithmetic part to well-known theories ranging from PA to the theory of \({\Sigma^1_1}\) dependent choice.",Graham Emil Leigh1 & Michael Rathjen,Archive for Mathematical Logic,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00153-009-0170-2,"Theories of truth,Relative consistency and interpretations,Ordinal analysis,Cut elimination"

In particular we show that the first order theory of \(H_{\omega _1}\) is the model companion of the first order theory of the universe of sets assuming the existence of class many Woodin cardinals, and working in a signature with predicates for \(\Delta _0\)-properties and for all universally Baire sets of reals. We will extend these results also to the theory of \(H_{\aleph _2}\) in a follow up of this paper.

In particular, if input and output intensities are defined in terms of stimulus frequencies and firing frequencies per neuron respectively, it is shown that a rectangular distribution of refractory periods leads to a logarithmic input-output curve. If input and output are defined in terms of the total number of stimuli and firings in the aggregate, it is shown how the “mobilization” picture leads to the logarithmic input-output curve.By randomizing the intervals between stimuli received by a single neuron and by introducing an inhibitory neuron a very simple “filter net” can be constructed whose output will be sensitive to a particular range of the input, and this range can be made arbitrarily small.",Anatol Rapoport,The bulletin of mathematical biophysics,1950,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02478248,"Refractory Period,Single Neuron,Output Intensity,Input Frequency,Input Intensity"

1509,"The Hypergeometric Sampling Design, Theory and Practice","
The main aim of this paper is to point out that a classical hypergeometric distribution can be viewed as an exact probabilistic description of a selection mechanism in many practical sample surveys. This selection mechanism, the hypergeometric (HG) sampling design, is an unequal probability with-replacement design. Exploiting properties of the HG distribution many useful results can be derived for sample surveys. In this paper we give the estimation formulae under the HG design. We also derive the inclusion probabilities of a related design, received by neglecting repeated elements from a HG sample. We show that a HG design coupled with a HG design in the second phase results in a two-phase design which is again HG. This property is used when deriving a Jackknife variance formula for a linear estimator under the HG design. Finally we consider the equal probability designs received from the HG design by a suitable sub-sampling procedure in the second phase. We give estimation formulae for some of such designs.

Two rational polygons P and Q are said to be discretely equidecomposable if there exists a piecewise affine-unimodular bijection (equivalently, a piecewise affine-linear bijection that preserves the integer lattice \({\mathbb {Z}}^2\)) from P to Q. We develop an invariant for a particular version of this notion called rational finite discrete equidecomposability. We construct triangles that are Ehrhart equivalent but not rationally finitely discretely equidecomposable, thus providing a partial negative answer to a question of Haase–McAllister on whether Ehrhart equivalence implies discrete equidecomposability. Surprisingly, if we delete an edge from each of these triangles, there exists an infinite rational discrete equidecomposability relation between them. Our final section addresses the topic of infinite equidecomposability with concrete examples and a potential setting for further investigation of this phenomenon.","Paxton Turner

The profile is given by the “squared-envelope function” of the interference signal, which is called the interferogram. The world’s fastest surface profiling algorithm exploits a generalized sampling theorem that directly reconstructs the squared-envelope function from an infinite number of samples of the interferogram. The optical system of the white light interferometer is equipped with an optical filter. So far there were no guidelines for designing the optical filter’s characteristics. Field engineers empirically chose some combination of commercial optical filters by checking the corresponding interferograms. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a guideline for designing the optical filter’s characteristics. That is, we devise the optimal characteristics of the optical filter in the sense that, with a fixed passband of the optical filter, the second moment of the squared interferogram is minimized. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the optimal characteristics.",Hidemitsu Ogawa1 & Akira Hirabayashi,Sampling Theory in Signal and Image Processing,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03549550,"White light interferometry,Surface profiling,Optimal characteristic of optical filter,Quadrature sampling,Second-order sampling"

1520,The Spectral Theory of Amenable Actions and Invariants of Discrete Groups,"Let G denote a semisimple group, Γ a discrete subgroup, B=G/P the Poisson boundary. Regarding invariants of discrete subgroups we prove, in particular, the following:(1) For any Γ-quasi-invariant measure η on B, and any probablity measure μ on Γ, the norm of the operator πη(μ) on L
2(B,η) is equal to ∥λΓ(μ)∥, where πη is the unitary representation in L
2(X,η), and λΓ is the regular representation of Γ.(2) In particular this estimate holds when η is Lebesgue measure on B, a Patterson–Sullivan measure, or a μ-stationary measure, and implies explicit lower bounds for the displacement and Margulis number of Γ (w.r.t. a finite generating set), the dimension of the conformal density, the μ-entropy of the measure, and Lyapunov exponents of Γ.(3) In particular, when G=PSL2(ℂ) and Γ is free, the new lower bound of the displacement is somewhat smaller than the Culler–Shalen bound (which requires an additional assumption) and is greater than the standard ball-packing bound.We also prove that ∥πη(μ)∥=∥λG(μ)∥ for any amenable action of G and μ∈L
1(G), and conversely, give a spectral criterion for amenability of an action of G under certain natural dynamical conditions. In addition, we establish a uniform lower bound for the μ-entropy of any measure quasi-invariant under the action of a group with property T, and use this fact to construct an interesting class of actions of such groups, related to 'virtual' maximal parabolic subgroups. Most of the results hold in fact in greater generality, and apply for instance when G is any semi-simple algebraic group, or when Γ is any word-hyperbolic group, acting on their Poisson boundary, for example.",Amos Nevo,Geometriae Dedicata,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1025839828396,"spectral theory,nonsingular actions,amenability,semi-simple Lie groups,discrete subgroups,Radon–Nikodym derivative,entropy,property T

n is nonexpansive with respect to the l
1-norm, \( \|x\|_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i| \), and satisfies f (0) = 0.  Let P
3(n) denote the (finite) set of positive integers p such that there exists f as above and a periodic point \( \xi \in K^n \) of f of minimal period p. For each n≥ 1 we use the concept of 'admissible arrays on n symbols' to define a set of positive integers Q(n) which is determined solely by number theoretical and combinatorial constraints and whose computation reduces to a finite problem. In a separate paper the sets Q(n) have been explicitly determined for 1 ≤n≤ 50, and we provide this information in an appendix. In our main theorem (Theorem 3.1) we prove that P
3(n) = Q(n) for all n≥ 1. We also prove that the set Q(n) and the concept of admissible arrays are intimately connected to the set of periodic points of other classes of nonlinear maps, in particular to periodic points of maps g : D

Then, for any linear combination of eigenfunctions above a certain index n, $$\begin{aligned} f = \sum _{k \ge n}{a_k \phi _k} ~ \text{ we } \text{ have } \quad \mathcal {H}^1 \left\{ x: f(x) = 0\right\} \gtrsim _{} \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{\log {n}}} \log \left( n \frac{\Vert f\Vert _{L^2(M)}}{\Vert f\Vert _{L^1(M)}} \right) ^{-1/2} \frac{\Vert f\Vert _{L^1(M)}}{\Vert f \Vert _{L^{\infty }(M)}} . \end{aligned}$$Examples on \(M=\mathbb {T}^2\) and \(M=\mathbb {S}^2\) shows that this is optimal up to the logarithmic factors. The proof is using optimal transport and a new inequality for the Wasserstein metric \(W_p\): if f(x)dx and g(x)dx are two absolutely continuous measures on a two-dimensional domain M with continuous densities and the same total mass, then, for all \(1 \le p <\infty \), $$\begin{aligned} W_p(f(x)dx, g(x) dx) \cdot \mathcal {H}^1 \left\{ x \in M: f(x) = g(x) \right\} \gtrsim _{M,p} \frac{\Vert f-g\Vert _{L^1(M)}^{1+1/p}}{\Vert f-g\Vert _{L^{\infty }(M)}}. \end{aligned}$$

Due to current threatening epidemics such as COVID-19, this interest is continuously rising. As our main goal, we establish an implicit time-discrete SIR (susceptible people–infectious people–recovered people) model. For this purpose, we first introduce its continuous variant with time-varying transmission and recovery rates and, as our first contribution, discuss thoroughly its properties. With respect to these results, we develop different possible time-discrete SIR models, we derive our implicit time-discrete SIR model in contrast to many other works which mainly investigate explicit time-discrete schemes and, as our main contribution, show unique solvability and further desirable properties compared to its continuous version. We thoroughly show that many of the desired properties of the time-continuous case are still valid in the time-discrete implicit case. Especially, we prove an upper error bound for our time-discrete implicit numerical scheme. Finally, we apply our proposed time-discrete SIR model to currently available data regarding the spread of COVID-19 in Germany and Iran.","Benjamin Wacker

We apply these results to non-uniformly hyperbolic systems and prove that a multimodal map with an absolutely continuous invariant measure must satisfy the classical extreme value laws (with no extra condition on the speed of mixing, for example). We also give applications of our theory to higher dimensional examples, for which we also obtain classical extreme value laws and exponential hitting time statistics (for balls). We extend these ideas to the subsequent returns to asymptotically small sets, linking the Poisson statistics of both processes.","Ana Cristina Moreira Freitas1, Jorge Milhazes Freitas2 & Mike Todd",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-009-0221-y,"Return time statistics,Extreme value theory,Non-uniform hyperbolicity,Interval maps"
1529,Poisson–Nernst–Planck Systems for Ion Flow with Density Functional Theory for Hard-Sphere Potential: I–V Relations and Critical Potentials. Part I: Analysis,"In this work, we analyze a one-dimensional steady-state Poisson–Nernst–Planck type model for ionic flow through a membrane channel including ionic interactions modeled from the Density Functional Theory in a simple setting: Two oppositely charged ion species are involved with electroneutrality boundary conditions and with zero permanent charge, and only the hard sphere component of the excess (beyond the ideal) electrochemical potential is included. The model can be viewed as a singularly perturbed integro-differential system with a parameter resulting from a dimensionless scaling of the problem as the singular parameter. Our analysis is a combination of geometric singular perturbation theory and functional analysis. The existence of a solution of the model problem for small ion sizes is established and, treating the sizes as small parameters, we also derive an approximation of the I–V (current–voltage) relation. For this relatively simple situation, it is found that the ion size effect on the I–V relation can go either way—enhance or reduce the current. More precisely, there is a critical potential value V

c
 so that, if V > V

c

A macroscopic theory governing the motion of plasma in a plasma-cell system is derived from the local volume averaging method for a system without mass transfer between the phases, and its characteristic length is much larger than the size of the cells. The equations governing the motion of the local averaged fluid quantities include one additional term in the equation of motion and two additional terms in the energy equation. These terms represent, respectively, the force exerted upon the fluid by the particles, and the rate of heat transfer and work done upon the fluid by the particles. The theory is applied to obtain the effective viscosity as the explicit function of the volume concentration of the cells by assuming that the cells behave like rigid spherical particles with slip-collision, and the plasma is an incompressible Newtonian fluid. Comparison with existing experimental results shows a good agreement. The theory is also used to obtain the effects of cell distribution upon the overall effective viscosity in a circular tube. The quantitative result shows that there is a decrease in overall effective viscosity as the concentration of cells increases toward the center of the tube, and the overall effective viscosity is smaller than the flow with evenly distributed cells.",Joseph C.

The harder part of the proof is proving the non-emptiness of the Brill-Noether loci.

1548,Global Melnikov Theory in Hamiltonian Systems with General Time-Dependent Perturbations,"We consider a mechanical system consisting of n-penduli and a d-degree-of-freedom rotator. The phase space of the rotator defines a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold \(\Lambda _0\). We apply a time-dependent perturbation, which is not assumed to be either Hamiltonian, or periodic, or quasi-periodic, as we allow for rather general time dependence. The strength of the perturbation is given by a parameter \(\varepsilon \in \mathbb {R}\). For all \(|\varepsilon |\) sufficiently small, the augmented flow—obtained by making the time into a new variable—has a normally hyperbolic locally invariant manifold \(\tilde{\Lambda }_\varepsilon \). For \(\varepsilon =0\), \(\tilde{\Lambda }_0=\Lambda _0\times \mathbb {R}\). We define a Melnikov-type vector, which gives the first-order expansion of the displacement of the stable and unstable manifolds of \(\tilde{\Lambda }_0\) under the perturbation. We provide an explicit formula for the Melnikov vector in terms of convergent improper integrals of the perturbation along homoclinic orbits of the unperturbed system. We show that if the perturbation satisfies some explicit non-degeneracy conditions, then the stable and unstable manifolds of \(\tilde{\Lambda }_\varepsilon \), \(W^\mathrm{s}(\tilde{\Lambda }_\varepsilon )\) and \(W^\mathrm{u}(\tilde{\Lambda }_\varepsilon )\), respectively, intersect along a transverse homoclinic manifold, and, moreover, the splitting of \(W^\mathrm{s}(\tilde{\Lambda }_\varepsilon )\) and \(W^\mathrm{u}(\tilde{\Lambda }_\varepsilon )\) can be explicitly computed, up to the first order, in terms of the Melnikov-type vector. This implies that the excursions along some homoclinic trajectories yield a non-trivial increase of order \(O(\varepsilon )\) in the action variables of the rotator, for all sufficiently small perturbations. The formulas that we obtain are independent of the unperturbed motions in \(\Lambda _0\), and give, at the same time, the effects on periodic, quasi-periodic, or general-type orbits. When the perturbation is Hamiltonian, we express the effects of the perturbation, up to the first order, in terms of a Melnikov potential. In addition, if the perturbation is periodic, we obtain that the non-degeneracy conditions on the Melnikov potential are generic.","Marian Gidea1 & Rafael de la Llave

The desired results for micromorphic continuum mechanics and couple stress theory are naturally obtained via direct transitions and reductions from the coupled conservation law of energy for micropolar continuum theory, respectively. The basic balance laws and equations for micromorphic continuum mechanics and couple stress theory are constituted by combining these results derived here and the traditional conservation laws and equations of mass and microinertia and the entropy inequality.

The author extended this result to optimal control problems by the use of a uniform growth condition, called (α), which is equivalent to Tonelli's pointwise growth condition for free problems with convex integrand (Refs. 4–5, 10). More recently, condition (α), or condition (Φ), which is equivalent to (α) for optimal control problems, was replaced by the much weaker condition (β) in existence theorems for optimal control problems (Refs. 1–2).In the present paper, we show that this same combination of growth condition (α) and condition (T) at the points of the exceptional set is actually a special case of the growth condition (β), which does not use the concept of the exceptional set.",J.

A frequency domain identification problem is formulated as an atomic norm regularization scheme in a random design framework of learning theory. Such a formulation makes it possible to obtain sparsity and provide finite sample estimates for learning the transfer function in a learning theory framework. Error analysis is done for the learning algorithm by applying a local polynomial reproduction formula, concentration inequalities and iteration techniques. The convergence rate obtained here is the best in the literature.

1557,Theory of neural mediation of intraocular dynamics,"Many experimental studies have indicated that the intraocular pressure is subject to mediation by adrenergic mechanisms affecting both the rate of formation of the aqueous humor and the resistance of the pathway through which the aqueous humor flows out of the eye. Thus, for example, the role of adrenergic drugs in glaucoma therapy is well known. How the mediation is accomplished has not been clarified in detail. Several possible mechanisms have been suggested, and all may indeed be involved. The present study is concerned with the basis and mathematical formulation of one of them and the consequences with respect to aqueous dynamics. The analysis leads to expressions for the aqueous outflow resistance and the formation rate, as well as other quantities of interest. The theoretical behavior is shown to compare favorably with the results of infusion studies and various other experiments, and to provide a unified picture of much of the pressure-flow behavior of both the living and the dead eye.",Robert W.

We assume (1) that the network and the interaction among particles are invariant under a group that satisfies some mild assumptions; (2) that the state of each particle is given by a real number; (3) that the interaction is invariant by adding an integer to the state of all the particles at the same time; (4) that the interaction is ferromagnetic and coercive (it favors local alignment and penalizes large local oscillations); and (5) some technical assumptions on the regularity speed of decay of the interaction with the distance. Note that the assumptions are mainly qualitative, so that they cover many of the models proposed in the literature. We conclude (A) that there are minimizing (ground states) quasi-periodic solutions of every frequency and that they satisfy several geometric properties; (B) if the minimizing solutions do not cover all possible values at a point, there is another equilibrium point which is not a ground state. These results generalize basic results of Aubry–Mather theory (take the network and the group to be ℤ).

Our major result extends the existing error bounds from the system involving only a single polynomial to a general polynomial system and do not require any regularity assumptions. In this way we resolve, in particular, some open questions posed in the literature. The developed techniques are largely based on variational analysis and generalized differentiation, which allow us to establish, e.g., a nonsmooth extension of the seminal Łojasiewicz’s gradient inequality to maxima of polynomials with explicitly determined exponents. Our major applications concern quantitative Hölderian stability of solution maps for parameterized polynomial optimization problems and nonlinear complementarity systems with polynomial data as well as high-order semismooth properties of the eigenvalues of symmetric tensors.","G.

1574,Second-gradient plane deformations of ideal fibre-reinforced materials: implications of hyper-elasticity theory,"The influence that some new, second-gradient, effects introduced in a recent publication (Spencer and Soldatos, Int J Non-linear Mech 42:355-368, 2007) have on finite plane deformations of ideal fibre-reinforced hyper-elastic solids is investigated. The second-gradient effects are due to the ability of the fibres to resist bending but, in the present case, the constraints of material incompressibility and fibre inextensibility associated with this ideal class of materials offer considerable theoretical simplification. In agreement with its conventional counterpart, where inextensible fibres are perfectly flexible, the present new theoretical development is still associated with kinematics and reaction stresses that are largely independent of the specific type of material behaviour considered. Static equilibrium considerations reveal therefore a manner in which relevant, non-symmetric stress distributions can be determined by solving two simultaneous, first-order linear differential equations. However, the principal interest of this investigation remains within the class of hyper-elastic materials for which two sets of relatively simple constitutive equations are obtained. At this stage of early theoretical development, immediate interest is directed towards the simplest of those sets, namely the set associated with problems where only gradients relevant to the change of the deformed fibre direction are of principal importance. These developments are applied (i) to the classical problem of plane-strain bending of a rectangular block reinforced by a family of straight fibres running parallel to one of its sides; and (ii) to the problem of “area-preserving” azimuthal shear strain of a circular cylindrical tube having its cross-section reinforced by a family of strong fibres. In the particular case in which the fibres are initially straight and aligned with the radii of the tube cross-section, the solution of the latter problem, which is new in the literature, reveals that fibres resist local bending completely. Instead, they remain straight during deformation and force the tube cross-section to undergo area-preserving azimuthal shear by changing their direction.",Kostas P.

1586,A theory of cell hydration governed by adsorption of water on cell proteins rather than by osmotic pressure,"It is postulated that cell hydration is governed by adsorption of water on cell proteins in accord with the Bradley adsorption isotherm, and that the action of a solute in the surrounding solution is to lower the vapor pressure of the solution so that cell water adsorption is decreased by moving down the Bradley isotherm. From these concepts, it is derived that cell volume (V) should be related to solute concentration (x) by the equationV=−E log10
x+F whereE andF are constants which are independent of type of solute. For a non-adsorbed solute this agrees well with experimental data. For solutes which are adsorbed by cell proteins, a correction in the above equation may be necessary at higher solute concentrations, which is shown to be compatible with various experimental data. The types of experiments which are generally used to support the osmotic pressure theory of cell hydration agree equally well with the adsorption theory. The virtue of the adsorption theory is that, unlike the osmotic pressure theory of cell swelling, it is compatible with permeability of the cell membrane to solutes, which has been experimentally observed for various solutes.",Freeman W.

1589,On extension of the phenomenological approach in the theory of plasticity,"Existing constitutive theories are commonly classified into three large groups: continuum, structural and micro structural. As a rule micro structural models, which are often referred to as physical, are based on the concept of crystallographic slip. One of the interesting exceptions is the theory of plasticity which accounts for micro strains. It postulates generalised deformation laws on mesoscale, and therefore has common properties of micro structural theories. However, it does not account for nanoprocesses, such as behaviour and interaction of separate dislocations, leads to the Von Mises initial yield condition, and accounts for Ilyushin’s postulate of isotropy and other macroscopic phenomenological laws of inelastic deformation. Thus, the theory of micro strains has much in common with continuum theories of plasticity and also establishes connection between continuum and micro structural approaches. In this article previous separate results concerning the theory of microstrains are reviewed and united into a single framework. The resulting generalised variant of the theory of micro strains accounts for both slip and twinning deformation mechanisms and also accurately models polycrystalline grain size distribution. Special cases and some important applications of the theory are discussed.","Yu. A. Chernyakov1, A. S. Polishchuk1 & V. P.

What would have happened if there were no Einstein? Few doubt that a theory much like special relativity would have emerged one way or another from the researchers of Lorentz, Poincaré and others. But where would the problem of relativizing gravitation have led? The saga told here shows how even the most conservative approach to relativizing gravitation theory still did lead out of Minkowski spacetime to connect gravitation to a curved spacetime. Unfortunately we still cannot know if this conclusion would have been drawn rapidly without Einstein's contribution. For what led Nordström to the gravitational field dependence of lengths and times was a very Einsteinian insistence on just the right version of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass. Unceasingly in Nordström's ear was the persistent and uncompromising voice of Einstein himself demanding that Nordström see the most distant consequences of his own theory.",John D.

The receptors are heterogeneous in their binding affinities (equilibrium binding constants) for the ligand. For any distribution of receptor binding affinities we show how to calculate the total concentration of receptors that are cross-linked by the ligand, i.e., the concentration of cell surface aggregates composed of two or more receptors, as well as the concentration of any given aggregate. We show that certain qualitative properties of cross-linking which hold for homogeneous antibody populations fail to hold in the heterogeneous case.

1597,Regularity theory for the generalized Neumann problem for Yang-Mills Connections – Non-trivial examples in dimensions 3 and 4," We develop the existence and regularity theory for the generalized Neumann problem for Yang-Mills connections. This is the most general boundary value problem for connections on a compact manifold with smooth boundary, with geometric meaning. It is obtained by reflecting the base manifold across its boundary and lifting this action non-trivially to the bundle. The prescribed lifting corresponds to a geometric invariant, which is similar to the monopole number. When this invariant is non-zero, there exist non-trivial solutions of the generalized Neumann problem. We prove the existence of non-trivial solutions over the 3-dimensional disk \(D^3\) and over the 4-dimensional manifold \(D^3\times S^1.\) We outline the procedure for finding non-trivial examples of solutions over more general manifolds of dimension 3 and 4.",Antonella Marini,Mathematische Annalen,2000,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002080050363,"Manifold,Smooth Boundary,Geometric Meaning,Compact Manifold,Neumann Problem"

Their convergence properties typically consider global minimizers or first-order critical points of the sample average approximation (SAA) problems and minimizers of the true problem, and show that the former converge to the latter for increasing sample size. However, the assumption of global minimization essentially restricts the scope of these results to convex problems. We review and extend these results in two directions: we allow for local SAA minimizers of possibly nonconvex problems and prove, under suitable conditions, almost sure convergence of local second-order solutions of the SAA problem to second-order critical points of the true problem. We also apply this new theory to the estimation of mixed logit models for discrete choice analysis.

1621,"Contributions to the theory of active transport: II. The gate type non-carrier mechanism and generalizations concerning tracer flow, efficiency, and measurement of energy expenditure","The gate type non-carrier mechanism, an active transport model, is discussed. In this mechanism, the actively transported particle passes through the gate itself by means of a series of reorganizations of the active transport mechanism. The net rate of transport, the rate of transport in either direction, and the efficiency of this model are analyzed. It is shown that on the basis of these analyses alone, this mechanism cannot be distinguished from a carrier mechanism.Three generalizations which apply to many individual type active transport models are then discussed. These pertain to (1) the dependency of the flow in one direction on the cencentration of the particles on the opposite side of the membrane, (2) the possibility of very high efficiencies for these models independent of the rate of the active transport, and (3) the methods whereby the energy expended in the active transport may be experimentally found.",Clifford S.

In this paper, we focus on decisions that are obtained by the empirical minimization of the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) and argue that in CVaR the trade-off between flexibility and generalization can be understood on the ground of theoretical results under very general assumptions on the system that generates the observations. The results have implications on topics related to order and structure selection in various applications where the CVaR risk-measure is used.

1636,Chemical Organisation Theory,"Complex dynamical reaction networks consisting of many components that interact and produce each other are difficult to understand, especially, when new component types may appear and present component types may vanish completely. Inspired by Fontana and Buss (Bull. Math. Biol., 56, 1–64) we outline a theory to deal with such systems. The theory consists of two parts. The first part introduces the concept of a chemical organisation as a closed and self-maintaining set of components. This concept allows to map a complex (reaction) network to the set of organisations, providing a new view on the system’s structure. The second part connects dynamics with the set of organisations, which allows to map a movement of the system in state space to a movement in the set of organisations. The relevancy of our theory is underlined by a theorem that says that given a differential equation describing the chemical dynamics of the network, then every stationary state is an instance of an organisation. For demonstration, the theory is applied to a small model of HIV-immune system interaction by Wodarz and Nowak (Proc. Natl. Acad. USA, 96, 14464–14469) and to a large model of the sugar metabolism of E. Coli by Puchalka and Kierzek (Biophys. J., 86, 1357–1372).

the eigenvalue structure, of localization, spectral gap, clustering, and distribution
type.Few generalizations are also considered in connection with the notion of generalized
locally Toeplitz sequences and applications are discussed, stemming e.g.
from the approximation of differential operators via numerical schemes. Nevertheless,

1645,Algebraic Theory of the Dependability of Binary Sensors,"Binary sensor systems are analog sensors of various types (optical, microelectromechanical (MEMS) systems, X-ray, gamma-ray, acoustic, electronic, etc.) based on the binary decision process. Typical examples of such “binary sensors” are X-ray luggage inspection systems, product quality control systems, automatic target recognition systems, numerous medical diagnostic systems, and many others. In all these systems, the binary decision process provides only two mutually exclusive responses. There are also two types of key parameters that characterize either a system or external conditions in relation to the system that are determined by their prior probabilities. In this paper, by using a formal neuron model, we analyze the problem of threshold redundancy of binary sensors of a critical state.The following three major tasks are solved:


(i)
implementation of the algorithm of calculation of error probabilities for threshold redundancy of a group of sensors;


(ii)
computation of the minimal upper bound for the probability in a closed analytical form and determination of its link with Claude Shannons theorem;


(iii)
derivation of the expression (estimate) for sensor “weights” when the probability of the binary system error does not exceed the specified minimal upper bound.

1651,Extension of Base-Criterion Method Based on Fuzzy Set Theory,"Due to the complexity as well as the uncertainty of the purpose and fuzziness of human thinking, human qualitative judgments generally hold the characteristics of obscurity and approximate. In order to extend the base-criterion method (BCM) to uncertain circumstances, fuzzy information recruiting may be a better way to address a lot of multi-criteria decision-making problems. In this paper, we have developed the BCM method based on the linguistic variables to the fuzzy environment. The base-comparisons for the base-criterion (selective or preferential) relative to the other criteria expressed by linguistic variables of decision-makers, which can be transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers to be utilized in the nonlinear optimization program. Afterward, the optimum fuzzy weights are determined according to the decision-maker preference. The optimum fuzzy weights of criteria can be transferred (if need) to crisp ranking scores by employing the GMIR (graded mean integration representation) method. The fuzzy BCM method can be used to tackle the problems with the characteristics of ambiguity and intangibility. This method uses linguistic terms such as “Extreme important”, “Very strong importance”, “Strong importance”, “Moderate importance”, and “Equally importance” to execute the base-comparisons. Using the linguistic variables causes executing the pairwise comparisons more accurately and easily and gets more trustworthy decision-making results. To show the applicability of fuzzy BCM, we analyzed two numerical examples (optimal transportation mode selection and car selection) for decision-making problems under a fuzzy environment. The results of this paper shows the fuzzy BCM results are fully consistent in terms of direction and strength.","Gholamreza Haseli1, Reza Sheikh1 & Shib Sankar Sana",International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40819-020-00807-4,"Multi-criteria decision-making,Base-criterion method,Linguistic fuzzy sets,Triangular fuzzy numbers,Pairwise comparison"

It is shown that for a law of density varying in inverse proportion to the radius, the first four modes with nodal diameters only, form an approximate harmonic sequence with the fundamental. With this law of loading, however, the relative frequencies of the symmetrical modes remain entirely unaffected (though their interior nodal circles contract), while the frequencies of the modes having both nodal diameters and nodal circles, require a greater degree of loading than that stated above to fall into the same harmonic sequence. The results thus show clearly that a type of loading so highly concentrated at the centre cannot succeed in reproducing completely the observed results.

1656,A First-Passage-Time Theory for Search and Capture of Chromosomes by Microtubules in Mitosis,"The mitotic spindle is an important intermediate structure in eukaryotic cell division, in which each of a pair of duplicated chromosomes is attached through microtubules to centrosomal bodies located close to the two poles of the dividing cell. Several mechanisms are at work toward the formation of the spindle, one of which is the ‘capture’ of chromosome pairs, held together by kinetochores, by randomly searching microtubules. Although the entire cell cycle can be up to 24 hours long, the mitotic phase typically takes only less than an hour. How does the cell keep the duration of mitosis within this limit? Previous theoretical studies have suggested that the chromosome search and capture is optimized by tuning the microtubule dynamic parameters to minimize the search time. In this paper, we examine this conjecture. We compute the mean search time for a single target by microtubules from a single nucleating site, using a systematic and rigorous theoretical approach, for arbitrary kinetic parameters. The result is extended to multiple targets and nucleating sites by physical arguments. Estimates of mitotic time scales are then obtained for different cells using experimental data. In yeast and mammalian cells, the observed changes in microtubule kinetics between interphase and mitosis are beneficial in reducing the search time. In Xenopus extracts, by contrast, the opposite effect is observed, in agreement with the current understanding that large cells use additional mechanisms to regulate the duration of the mitotic phase.",Manoj Gopalakrishnan1 & Bindu S.

1664,An asymptotic derivation of weakly nonlinear ray theory,"Using a method of expansion similar to Chapman-Enskog expansion, a new formal perturbation scheme based on high frequency approximation has been constructed. The scheme leads to an eikonal equation in which the leading order amplitude appears. The transport equation for the amplitude has been deduced with an errorO(ε2) where ε is the small parameter appearing in the high frequency approximation. On a length scale over which Choquet-Bruhat’s theory is valid, this theory reduces to the former. The theory is valid on a much larger length scale and the leading order terms give the weakly nonlinear ray theory (WNLRT) of Prasad, which has been very successful in giving physically realistic results and also in showing that the caustic of a linear theory is resolved when nonlinear effects are included. The weak shock ray theory with infinite system of compatibility conditions also follows from this theory.",Phoolan Prasad,Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences - Mathematical Sciences,2000,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02829536,"Nonlinear wave propagation,ray theory,hyperbolic equations,caustic"

The algorithm computes an approximate balanced truncation of the system using solution snapshots of specific linear infinite dimensional differential equations. The algorithm is related to the proper orthogonal decomposition, and it was first proposed for systems of ordinary differential equations by Rowley (Int. J. Bifurc. Chaos Appl. Sci. Eng. 15(3):997–1013, 2005). For the convergence analysis, we consider the algorithm in terms of the Hankel operator of the system, rather than the product of the system Gramians as originally proposed by Rowley. For exponentially stable systems with bounded finite rank input and output operators, we prove that the balanced realization can be expressed in terms of balancing modes, which are related to the Hankel operator. The balancing modes are required to be smooth, and this can cause computational difficulties for PDE systems. We show how this smoothness requirement can be lessened for parabolic systems, and we also propose a variation of the algorithm that avoids the smoothness requirement for general systems. We prove entrywise convergence of the matrices in the approximate reduced order models in both cases, and present numerical results for two example PDE systems.",John R.

1667,Phase Transitions in Rate Distortion Theory and Deep Learning,"Rate distortion theory is concerned with optimally encoding signals from a given signal class \(\mathcal {S}\) using a budget of R bits, as \(R \rightarrow \infty \). We say that \(\mathcal {S}\) can be compressed at rate s if we can achieve an error of at most \(\mathcal {O}(R^{-s})\) for encoding the given signal class; the supremal compression rate is denoted by \(s^*(\mathcal {S})\). Given a fixed coding scheme, there usually are some elements of \(\mathcal {S}\) that are compressed at a higher rate than \(s^*(\mathcal {S})\) by the given coding scheme; in this paper, we study the size of this set of signals. We show that for certain “nice” signal classes \(\mathcal {S}\), a phase transition occurs: We construct a probability measure \(\mathbb {P}\) on \(\mathcal {S}\) such that for every coding scheme \(\mathcal {C}\) and any \(s > s^*(\mathcal {S})\), the set of signals encoded with error \(\mathcal {O}(R^{-s})\) by \(\mathcal {C}\) forms a \(\mathbb {P}\)-null-set. In particular, our results apply to all unit balls in Besov and Sobolev spaces that embed compactly into \(L^2 (\varOmega )\) for a bounded Lipschitz domain \(\varOmega \). As an application, we show that several existing sharpness results concerning function approximation using deep neural networks are in fact generically sharp. In addition, we provide quantitative and non-asymptotic bounds on the probability that a random \(f\in \mathcal {S}\) can be encoded to within accuracy \(\varepsilon \) using R bits. This result is subsequently applied to the problem of approximately representing \(f\in \mathcal {S}\) to within accuracy \(\varepsilon \) by a (quantized) neural network with at most W nonzero weights. We show that for any \(s > s^*(\mathcal {S})\) there are constants c, C such that, no matter what kind of “learning” procedure is used to produce such a network, the probability of success is bounded from above by \(\min \big \{1, 2^{C\cdot W \lceil \log _2 (1+W) \rceil ^2 - c\cdot \varepsilon ^{-1/s}} \big \}\).","Philipp Grohs1,2, Andreas Klotz1 & Felix Voigtlaender3 nAff",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-021-09546-4,"Rate distortion theory,Phase transition,Approximation rates,Sobolev spaces,Besov spaces,Neural network approximation"

1673,Time Dependent Resonance Theory," An important class of resonance problems involves the study of perturbations of systems having embedded eigenvalues in their continuous spectrum. Problems with this mathematical structure arise in the study of many physical systems, e.g. the coupling of an atom or molecule to a photon-radiation field, and Auger states of the helium atom, as well as in spectral geometry and number theory. We present a dynamic (time-dependent) theory of such quantum resonances. The key hypotheses are (i) a resonance condition which holds generically (non-vanishing of the Fermi golden rule) and (ii) local decay estimates for the unperturbed dynamics with initial data consisting of continuum modes associated with an interval containing the embedded eigenvalue of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. No assumption of dilation analyticity of the potential is made. Our method explicitly demonstrates the ow of energy from the resonant discrete mode to continuum modes due to their coupling. The approach is also applicable to nonautonomous linear problems and to nonlinear problems. We derive the time behavior of the resonant states for intermediate and long times. Examples and applications are presented. Among them is a proof of the instability of an embedded eigenvalue at a threshold energy under suitable hypotheses.

Algebraic functions of the adapted tristimulus values are presented which are illuminant-invariant for some departures from the spectral heuristics.

Dipole's behavior and gating currents,"To explain the sodium conductance change using Wei's dipole model (Wei, 1969), we may expect that during depolarization the dipole's population difference, ΔN, is first reduced and then returns more slowly to its resting value. This paper shows that the experimental results of gating currents support this idea. Such time course of ΔN, however, is not a usual relaxation process. To account for the unusual behavior of ΔN, we propose two additional assumptions: (1) there exists a special coupling system (probably the intramolecular vibrations) whose coupling strength with the dipoles is much stronger than with the thermal bath (intermolecular vibrations), and (2) there also exist “traps” for the dipole's excitation energy so that this energy is transformed into other energy forms at a rate increasing with the increase of depolarization.

0(?(d)) which involves only local data; the results of [9] cited earlier allow us to give a bound on the d where the formula applies. We also show that a major open problem in approximation theory may be formulated in terms of a cohomology vanishing on P

In this paper, first we introduce the Fibonacci weighted sequence space, \(F_{w,p}~(0< p < 1)\), of non-absolute type which is the p-normed space and is linearly isomorphic to the space \(\ell _p(w)\), where the weight sequence \(w=\{w_n\}_{n=0}^\infty \) is a increasing, non-negative sequence of real numbers.

The setting of the problem studied in the paper has been motivated by a recent paper by Smale and Zhou. The starting point for us is a kernel K(x, u) defined on X × Ω.

If a diagonally dominant M-matrix is perturbed in a way that each off-diagonal entry and its row sums (i.e. the quantities of diagonal dominance) have small relative errors, we show that its determinant, cofactors, each entry of the inverse and the smallest eigenvalue all have small relative errors. The error bounds are given and they do not depend on any condition number. Applying this result to the studies of electrical circuits and tail probabilities of a queue whose embedded Markov chains is of GI/M/1 type, we discuss the relative sensitivity of the operating speed of circuits and of the percentile of the queue length, respectively.","Attahiru Sule Alfa1, Jungong Xue2 & Qiang Ye",Numerische Mathematik,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002110100289,"Mathematics Subject Classification (1991): 65F35, 15A42"

1738,Aspects of 3-manifold theory in classical and quantum general relativity,Einstein’s field equation of General Relativity can be cast into the form of evolution equations with well posed Cauchy problem. The object that undergoes evolution is then a Riemannian 3-manifold the instantaneous dynamical configuration of which is either described by a Teichmüller (Riemannian metrics modulo diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity) or Riemannian moduli space (Riemannian metrics modulo all diffeomorphisms); the former being the universal cover of the latter. The two are related by the action of the mapping-class group of the underlying 3-manifold which may act as group of residual dynamical symmetries. In this way topological information regarding the Cauchy surface enters the dynamical description in an interesting way that has been speculated to be potentially significant in canonical quantum-gravity.

1753,"A mixture theory-based concrete corrosion model coupling chemical reactions, diffusion and mechanics","A 3-D continuum mixture model describing the corrosion of concrete with sulfuric acid is built. Essentially, the chemical reaction transforms slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and sulfuric acid into gypsum releasing water. The model incorporates the evolution of chemical reaction, diffusion of species within the porous material and mechanical deformations. This model is applied to a 1-D problem of a plate-layer between concrete and sewer air. The influx of slaked lime from the concrete and sulfuric acid from the sewer air sustains a gypsum creating chemical reaction (sulfatation or sulfate attack). The combination of the influx of matter and the chemical reaction causes a net growth in the thickness of the gypsum layer on top of the concrete base. The model allows for the determination of the plate layer thickness h=h(t) as function of time, which indicates both the amount of gypsum being created due to concrete corrosion and the amount of slaked lime and sulfuric acid in the material. The existence of a parameter regime for which the model yields a non-decreasing plate layer thickness h(t) is identified numerically. The robustness of the model with respect to changes in the model parameters is also investigated.","Arthur J.

In the most prominent variant, we are given an edge-weighted graph and two customer sets \({\fancyscript{R}_1}\) and \({\fancyscript{R}_2}\) ; we ask for a minimum cost subgraph that connects all customers, and guarantees two-node-connectivity for the \({\fancyscript{R}_2}\) customers. We also consider an alternative of this problem, in which 2-node-connectivity is only required w.r.t. a certain root node, and its prize-collecting variant. The central result of this paper is a novel graph-theoretical characterization of 2-node-connected graphs via orientation properties. This allows us to derive two classes of ILP formulations based on directed graphs, one using multi-commodity flow and one using cut-inequalities. We prove the theoretical advantages of these directed models compared to the previously known ILP approaches. We show that our two concepts are equivalent from the polyhedral point of view. On the other hand, our experimental study shows that the cut formulation is much more powerful in practice.

1755,From Problems to Structures: the Cousin Problems and the Emergence of the Sheaf Concept,"Historical work on the emergence of sheaf theory has mainly concentrated on the topological origins of sheaf cohomology in the period from 1945 to 1950 and on subsequent developments. However, a shift of emphasis both in time-scale and disciplinary context can help gain new insight into the emergence of the sheaf concept. This paper concentrates on Henri Cartan’s work in the theory of analytic functions of several complex variables and the strikingly different roles it played at two stages of the emergence of sheaf theory: the definition of a new structure and formulation of a new research programme in 1940–1944; the unexpected integration into sheaf cohomology in 1951–1952. In order to bring this two-stage structural transition into perspective, we will concentrate more specifically on a family of problems, the so-called Cousin problems, from Poincaré (1883) to Cartan. This medium-term narrative provides insight into two more general issues in the history of contemporary mathematics. First, we will focus on the use of problems in theory-making. Second, the history of the design of structures in geometrically flavoured contexts—such as for the sheaf and fibre-bundle structures—which will help provide a more comprehensive view of the structuralist moment, a moment whose algebraic component has so far been the main focus for historical work.",Renaud Chorlay,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-009-0052-3,"Holomorphic Function,Meromorphic Function,Open Covering,Cohomology Theory,Stein Manifold"

1764,Studies in Babylonian lunar theory: part III. The introduction of the uniform zodiac,"This paper is the third of a multi-part examination of the Babylonian mathematical lunar theories known as Systems A and B. Part I (Britton, AHES 61:83–145, 2007) addressed the development of the empirical elements needed to separate the effects of lunar and solar anomaly on the intervals between syzygies, accomplished in the construction of the System A lunar theory early in the fourth century B.C. Part II (Britton, AHES 63:357–431, 2009) examines the accomplishment of this separation by the construction of a successful theory depicting the variations due to lunar anomaly in System A and its subsequent adaptation in System B. The present paper examines the introduction of the uniform zodiac, necessary for any theory depicting variations depending on the position of syzygy. It addresses three questions: (1) In light of all available evidence, what is the magnitude of the constant term in the expression Δλ* = C − 1.3828°Y, describing the difference between the Babylonian sidereal longitudes and modern tropical longitudes? (2) What considerations governed the placement of the Babylonian sidereal zodiac relative to the fixed stars? (3) When was the uniform zodiac introduced? To the first question it finds C = 3.20° ± 0.1°, scarcely different from Huber’s (Centaurus 5:192–208, 1958) estimate of 3.08°, essentially confirming Huber’s result obtained from much less data. For the second it shows that accommodating the three asterisms comprising Taurus limited the placement of the zodiac to within 3°, while the prominence of half sign multiples among the measured intervals between prominent Normal Stars led irresistibly to the choice adopted. Finally, it finds that the zodiac was introduced between −408 and −397 and probably within a very few years of −400.",John P.

An approximate solution, valid for small capillary numbers, was given by Landau and Levich, and considerable effort has been exerted to extend or refine this work. In this paper we show that the Landau-Levich result is an asymptotic solution valid as the capillary number tends to zero, a fact not properly appreciated hitherto, and show how correction terms may be obtained by the method of matched expansions.

1768,Rank-initial embeddings of non-standard models of set theory,"A theoretical development is carried to establish fundamental results about rank-initial embeddings and automorphisms of countable non-standard models of set theory, with a keen eye for their sets of fixed points. These results are then combined into a “geometric technique” used to prove several results about countable non-standard models of set theory. In particular, back-and-forth constructions are carried out to establish various generalizations and refinements of Friedman’s theorem on the existence of rank-initial embeddings between countable non-standard models of the fragment \({\mathrm {KP}}^{{\mathcal {P}}}\) + \(\Sigma _1^{{\mathcal {P}}}\)-Separation of \({\mathrm {ZF}}\); and Gaifman’s technique of iterated ultrapowers is employed to show that any countable model of \({\mathrm {GBC}} + \text {``}{\mathrm {Ord}}\text { is weakly compact''}\) can be elementarily rank-end-extended to models with well-behaved automorphisms whose sets of fixed points equal the original model. These theoretical developments are then utilized to prove various results relating self-embeddings, automorphisms, their sets of fixed points, strong rank-cuts, and set theories of different strengths. Two examples: The notion of “strong rank-cut” is characterized (i) in terms of the theory \({\mathrm {GBC}} + \text {``}{\mathrm {Ord}}\text { is weakly compact''}\), and (ii) in terms of fixed-point sets of self-embeddings.

1769,Collective Pulsing in Xeniid Corals: Part I—Using Computer Vision and Information Theory to Search for Coordination,"Xeniid corals (Cnidaria: Alcyonacea), a family of soft corals, include species displaying a characteristic pulsing behavior. This behavior has been shown to increase oxygen diffusion away from the coral tissue, resulting in higher photosynthetic rates from mutualistic symbionts. Maintaining such a pulsing behavior comes at a high energetic cost, and it has been proposed that coordinating the pulse of individual polyps within a colony might enhance the efficiency of fluid transport. In this paper, we test whether patterns of collective pulsing emerge in coral colonies and investigate possible interactions between polyps within a colony. We video recorded different colonies of Heteroxenia sp. in a laboratory environment. Our methodology is based on the systematic integration of a computer vision algorithm (ISOMAP) and an information-theoretic approach (transfer entropy), offering a vantage point to assess coordination in collective pulsing. Perhaps surprisingly, we did not detect any form of collective pulsing behavior in the colonies. Using artificial data sets, however, we do demonstrate that our methodology is capable of detecting even weak information transfer. The lack of a coordination is consistent with previous work on many cnidarians where coordination between actively pulsing polyps and medusa has not been observed. In our companion paper, we show that there is no fluid dynamic benefit of coordinated pulsing, supporting this result. The lack of coordination coupled with no obvious fluid dynamic benefit to grouping suggests that there may be non-fluid mechanical advantages to forming colonies, such as predator avoidance and defense.","Julia E.

The problem is formulated as a set of partial differential equations governing the space and time dependence of the amounts of each component of the tissue (phase), together with the physical stresses in each component. The theory requires constitutive relations to specify the material properties of each phase, and also requires relations to specify the stresses developed due to mechanical interactions, both within each phase and between different phases. An application of the theory is given to the study of the mobility and aggregation of a population of cells seeded into an artificial polymeric scaffold. Stability analysis techniques show that the interplay of the forces between the tissue constituents results in two different regimes: either the cells form aggregates or disperse through the scaffold.","Greg Lemon1, John R.

Being discrete and stochastic, however, our population nonetheless goes extinct in finite time. We present results concerning the maximum of the population prior to extinction in the large population limit, from which we obtain establishment probabilities and upper bounds for the process, as well as estimates for the waiting time to establishment and extinction. As a consequence, we show that conditional upon establishment, the stochastic logistic process will with high probability greatly exceed carrying capacity an arbitrary number of times prior to extinction.","Todd L.

The error equation between the solutions of the limiting equation and that of the current one is considered as a perturbation equation in the fixed- point and stability analyses. The existence of a unique fixed point which is later proved to be an asymptotically stable equilibrium point is investigated. The stability conditions are basically concerned with the matrix measure of the delay-free matrix of dynamics to be negative and to have a modulus larger than the contribution of the error dynamics with respect to the limiting one. Alternative conditions are obtained concerned with the matrix dynamics for zero delay to be negative and to have a modulus larger than an appropriate contributions of the error dynamics of the current dynamics with respect to the limiting one. Since global stability is guaranteed under some deviation of the current solution related to the limiting one, which is considered as nominal, the stability is robust against such errors for certain tolerance margins.",M.

1788,A Theory of Immunodominance and Adaptive Regulation,"Immunodominance refers to the phenomenon in which simultaneous T cell responses against multiple target epitopes organize themselves into distinct and reproducible hierarchies. In many cases, eliminating the response to the most dominant epitope allows responses to subdominant epitopes to expand more fully. The mechanism that drives immunodominance is still not well understood, although various hypotheses have been proposed. One of the more prevalent views is that immunodominance is driven by passive T cell competition for space on antigen presenting cells (APCs) or for access to specific MHC:epitope complexes on the surface of APCs. However, several experimental studies suggest that passive competition alone may not fully explain the robustness of immunodominance under physiological conditions or varying proportions of antigen-specific precursor T cells and APCs. These studies propose that a mechanism of active suppression among T cells gives rise to immunodominance.In this work, we present the novel hypothesis that mutual suppression of simultaneous T cell responses results from the appearance of adaptive regulatory T cells (iTregs) during the course of the overall T cell expansion. We extend the mathematical model of T cell expansion proposed in Kim et al. (Bull. Math. Biol. 2009, doi:10.1007/s11538-009-9463-1) to consider multiple, concurrent T cell responses. The model is formulated as a system of independent feedback loops, in which antigen-specific T cell population produces a nonspecific feedback response. Our simulations show that the fastest response to expand gives rise to a de novo generated population of iTregs that induces a premature contraction in slower or weaker T cell responses, leading to a hierarchical expansion as observed in immunodominance. Furthermore, in some cases, removing the dominant T cell response allows previously subdominant responses to develop more fully.","Peter S. Kim1, Peter P.

1792,Understanding hermaphrodite species through game theory,"We investigate the existence and stability of sexual strategies (sequential hermaphrodite, successive hermaphrodite or gonochore) at a proximate level. To accomplish this, we constructed and analyzed a general dynamical game model structured by size and sex. Our main objective is to study how costs of changing sex and of sexual competition should shape the sexual behavior of a hermaphrodite. We prove that, at the proximate level, size alone is insufficient to explain the tendency for a pair of prospective copulants to elect the male sexual role by virtue of the disparity in the energetic costs of eggs and sperm. In fact, we show that the stability of sequential vs. simultaneous hermaphrodite depends on sex change costs, while the stability of protandrous vs. protogynous strategies depends on competition cost.","Amira Kebir1,2, Nina H.

These interactions lead to various types of complexity dynamics. One key difficulty in the study of complex agent interactions is the difficulty of modeling agent  communication on the basis of rewards.

Previously, while a large amount of literature is available on game theory, most of it is from specific domains and does not cater for the concepts from an agent-based perspective.

In this article, we connect evolutionary models for infinite and finite populations: While the population itself is infinite, interactions and reproduction occurs in random groups of size N. Surprisingly, the resulting dynamics simplifies to the traditional replicator system with a slightly modified payoff matrix. The qualitative results, however, mirror the findings for finite populations, in which strategies are selected according to a probabilistic Moran process. In particular, we derive a one-third law that holds for any population size. In this way, we show that the deterministic replicator equation in an infinite population can be used to study the Moran process in a finite population and vice versa. We apply the results to three examples to shed light on the evolution of cooperation in the iterated prisoner’s dilemma, on risk aversion in coordination games and on the maintenance of dominated strategies.",Christian Hilbe,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-010-9608-2,"Evolutionary game theory,Replicator dynamics,Moran process,One-third rule,Evolution of cooperation"

These matrices correspond to bipartite graphs with spectral radius less than 2, which can be classified as disjoint unions of Coxeter graphs. This gives a direct route to an ADE-classification result in terms of very basic mathematical objects. Our goal here is to see these results as part of a general program of classification of small objects, relating quadratic forms, reflection groups, root systems, and Lie algebras.","Terrence Bisson1 & Jonathan Lopez

They have an action of a Borel subgroup, and the projective coordinate ring of a Bott–Samelson variety splits into certain generalized Demazure modules (which also appear in other contexts [22, 23]). Standard Monomial Theory, developed by Seshadri and the first author [15, 16], and recently completed by the second author [20], gives explicit bases for the Demazure modules associated to Schubert varieties. In this paper, we extend the techniques of [20] to give explicit bases for the generalized Demazure modules associated to Bott–Samelson varieties, thus proving a strengthened form of the results announced by the first and third authors in [12] (see also [13]).

This leads to a very useful characterization of the generalized gradient of the following convex composite function: the sum of the largest eigenvalues of a smooth symmetric matrix-valued function of a set of real parameters. The dual matrix provides the information required to either verify first-order optimality conditions at a point or to generate a descent direction for the eigenvalue sum from that point, splitting a multiple eigenvalue if necessary.

Next, without making the usual definiteness assumption for the strain energy density, a dynamic uniqueness theorem is constructed for the solutions of the governing equations. Logarithmic convexity arguments are then used to enumerate a set of conditions sufficient for uniqueness.

1819,"On the formulation and analysis of general deterministic structured population models
II. Nonlinear theory"," This paper is as much about a certain modelling methodology, as it is about the constructive definition of future population states from a description of individual behaviour and an initial population state. The key idea is to build a nonlinear model in two steps, by explicitly introducing the environmental condition via the requirement that individuals are independent from one another (and hence equations are linear) when this condition is prescribed as a function of time.A linear physiologically structured population model is defined by two rules, one for reproduction and one for development and survival, both depending on the initial individual state and the prevailing environmental condition. In Part I we showed how one can constructively define future population state operators from these two ingredients.A nonlinear model is a linear model together with a feedback law that describes how the environmental condition at any particular time depends on the population size and composition at that time. When applied to the solution of the linear problem, the feedback law yields a fixed point problem. This we solve constructively by means of the contraction mapping principle, for any given initial population state. Using subsequently this fixed point as input in the linear population model, we obtain a population semiflow. We then say that we solved the nonlinear problem.For models formulated as first order partial differential equations with nonlocal boundary conditions our approach amounts to deriving an integral equation by integrating along characteristics. This integral equation is then solved by a successive approximation procedure. By formalizing the biological ingredients directly as integral kernels and using these to construct the semigroup of population state transition operators we (a) can do with rather minimal regularity conditions on the coefficients (i.e., on individual behaviour), (b) do not have to worry about regularity properties of solutions to guarantee that we really have constructed a solution of a pde.The paper is organized in a top-down spirit: We describe a general abstract setting first and then specialise, while becoming more technical.The results are not restricted to a single population but also cover the interaction (including predation) of several structured (and unstructured) populations.","O.

A method is suggested for measuring the color changes quantitatively. This method is readily adapted for demonstration purposes. The model shows that there should be differences between “primaries” and “binaries” with respect to change in hue.

1826,Theory of image formation in combinations of x-ray focussing mirrors,"It is shown that ideally Bragg reflections can occur successively from two surfaces only if they form parts of the same sphere, a result shown to be sufficient (but not necessary) in an earlier publication. However, if the aperture radius and the size of the object are small compared to the radius of curvature of the reflecting surfaces (such that fourth and higher power of their ratios are less than (10−6), then the combination will work even with aspherical surfaces, provided the two reflectors are surfaces of revolution about a common axis and they are both concave reflectors having the same vertex radius of curvature and are separated by a distance equal to twice this radius. If a combination of two such mirrors are used, andN multiple reflections obtained with them, then the optical path is reduced appreciably (approximately as 1/N) and the spherical aberration is also decreased (being proportional to 1/N) for large magnifications. The resolving power of such a combination should be of the order of 50 °A.

1828,On the structure of Carnot's theory of heat,"A simple connection is pointed out between the theory of heat formulated in Sadi Carnot's: “Réflexions sur la puissance motrice du feu” (1824) and the later Kelvin-Clausius thermodynamics. In both theories two well-defined quantities, a heat function and a work function, exist and can be calculated by integrating along a reversible path. In thermodynamics the work function (energy) is conserved, whereas the heat function (entropy) increases by irreversible processes. In Carnot's theory the heat function is conserved, whereas the work function decreases, so that in this theory the irreversible process is characterized by a loss of work.",Philip Lervig,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,1972,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00327304,"Entropy,Work Function,Heat Function,Irreversible Process,Reversible Path"

1830,On the Decomposition of Equations of Micropolar Elasticity and Thin Body Theory,"AbstractThe motion equations of the micropolar theory of elasticity in
displacements and rotations represented by the matrix differential
tensor-operator for any inhomogeneous anisotropic materials. As a
particular case the micropolar isotropic homogeneous materials
with a center of symmetry is considered. In this case, the matrix
differential tensor-operator of cofactors to the matrix
differential tensor-operator of the motion equations is
constructed. This constructed operator makes possible to decompose
the equations. The equations are obtained separately with respect
to the displacement and rotation vectors. Decomposed equations
also obtained for a reduced medium. In this case, the equation
with respect to the displacement vector is the same as the
equation of the classical theory, and the equation with respect to
the rotation vector has a similar form. In addition, in the
absence of volume loads, the equations of the reduced medium do
not depend on the properties of the material. This suggests that
these equations can be used to identify the material constants of
this medium. The cases under which the static boundary conditions
are easily split are revealed. From the decomposed equations of
the micropolar theories of elasticity, the corresponding
decomposed equations of the static (quasistatic) problem of the
theories of single-layer and multi-layer prismatic bodies of
constant thickness in displacements and rotations are obtained.
From the last systems of equations the equations in the moments of
unknown vector functions with respect to any systems of orthogonal
polynomials are derived. As a particular case, we obtain a system
of equations of the eighth approximation in moments with respect
to the system of Legendre polynomials, which decomposes into two
systems. One of them is the system with respect to the even order
moments of the unknown vector function, and the other system is
the system with respect to odd order moments of the same
functions. Based on the obtained operator of cofactors to the
operator of any of these systems we get a high order (the order of
the system depends on the order of approximation) elliptic type
equation for each moment of the unknown vector function, which
characteristic roots are easily found. Using Vekua’s method for
solving such equations [66], we can obtain their analytical
solution. Note also that the analytic method with the use of the
orthogonal polynomial systems (Legendre and Chebyshev) in
constructing the one-layer [2, 3, 7, 10, 15, 17, 18, 20–22, 63,
68, 69] and multilayer [4–6, 13, 60, 61] thin body theory was
also applied by other authors. In this direction the authors had
published the papers [24–31, 33–37, 41–45, 51–53], and others
with the application of Legendre and Chebyshev polynomial systems.
These expansions can be successfully used in constructing any thin
body theory. Despite this, classical theories are far from
perfect, and micropolar theories and theories of another rheology
are very far from perfect.","M. Nikabadze1,2 & A.

1831,Disjunctive Optimization: Critical Point Theory,"In this paper, we introduce the concepts of (nondegenerate) stationary points and stationary index for disjunctive optimization problems. Two basic theorems from Morse theory, which imply the validity of the (standard) Morse relations, are proved. The first one is a deformation theorem which applies outside the stationary point set. The second one is a cell-attachment theorem which applies at nondegenerate stationary points. The dimension of the cell to be attached equals the stationary index. Here, the stationary index depends on both the restricted Hessian of the Lagrangian and the set of active inequality constraints. In standard optimization problems, the latter contribution vanishes.","H. T. Jongen1, J. J. Rückmann2 & O.

This initial distribution of gametes is derived from the initial distribution of genotypes.

1846,Stochastic stable population growth in integral projection models: theory and application,"Stochastic matrix projection models are widely used to model age- or stage-structured populations with vital rates that fluctuate randomly over time. Practical applications of these models rest on qualitative properties such as the existence of a long term population growth rate, asymptotic log-normality of total population size, and weak ergodicity of population structure. We show here that these properties are shared by a general stochastic integral projection model, by using results in (Eveson in D. Phil. Thesis, University of Sussex, 1991, Eveson in Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. 70, 411–440, 1993) to extend the approach in (Lange and Holmes in J. Appl. Prob. 18, 325–344, 1981). Integral projection models allow individuals to be cross-classified by multiple attributes, either discrete or continuous, and allow the classification to change during the life cycle. These features are present in plant populations with size and age as important predictors of individual fate, populations with a persistent bank of dormant seeds or eggs, and animal species with complex life cycles. We also present a case-study based on a 6-year field study of the Illyrian thistle, Onopordum illyricum, to demonstrate how easily a stochastic integral model can be parameterized from field data and then applied using familiar matrix software and methods. Thistle demography is affected by multiple traits (size, age and a latent “quality” variable), which would be difficult to accomodate in a classical matrix model. We use the model to explore the evolution of size- and age-dependent flowering using an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) approach. We find close agreement between the observed flowering behavior and the predicted ESS from the stochastic model, whereas the ESS predicted from a deterministic version of the model is very different from observed flowering behavior. These results strongly suggest that the flowering strategy in O. illyricum is an adaptation to random between-year variation in vital rates.",Stephen P.

1847,Invariant theory for coincidental complex reflection groups,"V.F. Molchanov considered the Hilbert series for the space of invariant skew-symmetric tensors and dual tensors with polynomial coefficients under the action of a real reflection group, and he speculated that it had a certain product formula involving the exponents of the group. We show that Molchanov’s speculation is false in general but holds for all coincidental complex reflection groups when appropriately modified using exponents and co-exponents. These are the irreducible well-generated (i.e., duality) reflection groups with exponents forming an arithmetic progression and include many real reflection groups and all non-real Shephard groups, e.g., the Shephard-Todd infinite family G(d, 1, n). We highlight consequences for the q-Narayana and q-Kirkman polynomials, giving simple product formulas for both, and give a q-analogue of the identity transforming the h-vector to the f-vector for the coincidental finite type cluster/Cambrian complexes of Fomin–Zelevinsky and Reading.

The suggested approach relies on the probabilistic nature of the metabolic events and the Poisson distribution of the incoming flow of substrate molecules. The main focus of the work is an output flow of metabolites or the effectiveness of metabolism process. Two simplest models have been analyzed: short- and long-living complexes of the source molecules with a metabolizing point (Hole) without queuing. It has been concluded that the approach based on queueing theory enables a very broad range of metabolic events to be described theoretically from a single probabilistic point of view.","Vladyslav P.

Our approach is based on the natural strategy to draw on the results in the iid case for the embedded ordinary random walks \((S_{\tau _{n}(i)})_{n\ge 0}\), where \(\tau _{1}(i),\tau _{2}(i),\ldots \) denote the successive return times of M to state i, and an analysis of the excursions of the walk between these epochs.

1860,On diffusion theory in turbulence,"The Fokker-Planck equation for the probability density of fluid particle position in inhomogeneous unsteady turbulent flow is derived. The equation is obtained starting from the general kinematic relationship between velocity and displacement of a fluid particle and applying exact asymptotic analysis. For (almost) incompressible flow the equation reduces to the convection diffusion equation and the equation pertaining to the scalar gradient hypothesis. In this way the connection is established with eddy diffusivity models, widely used in numerical codes of computational fluid dynamics. It is further shown that within the accuracy of the approximation scheme of the diffusion limit, diffusion constants can equally be based on coarse-grained Lagrangian statistics as defined by Kolmogorov or on Eulerian statistics in a frame that moves with the mean Eulerian velocity as proposed by Burgers. The results presented for diffusion theory are the leading terms of asymptotic expansions. Truncated terms are higher-order spatial derivatives of the probability density or of the scalar mean value with coefficients based on cumulants higher than second order of fluid velocities and their derivatives. The magnitude of these terms has been assessed by employing scaling rules of turbulent flows in pipes and channels, turbulent boundary layers, turbulent jets, wakes and mixing layers, grid turbulence, convective layers and canopy turbulence. It reveals that a true diffusion limit does not exist. Although truncated terms can be of limited magnitude, a limit process by which these terms become vanishingly small and by which the diffusion approximation would become exact does not occur for any of the cases of turbulent flow considered. Applying the concepts of diffusion theory resorts to employing approximate methods of analysis.",J.J.H.

The FTCs \(\mathfrak{T}\) consisting of archimedean latticeordered groups are characterized: for each subgroup A of the rationals with the identity 1, either \(\mathfrak{T} = \mathfrak{S}\left( A \right)\), the class of all lattice-ordered groups of functions on a set X which have finite range in A, or \(\mathfrak{T} = \mathbb{T}\left( A \right)\), the class of all subgroups of A with 1.As for FTCs possessing non-archimedean groups, it is shown that if \(\mathfrak{T}\) is an FTC containing a subgroup A of the reals with 1, of rank two or greater, then \(\mathfrak{T}\) contains all ℓ-groups of the form \(A\vec \times G\), for all abelian lattice-ordered groups G.

1864,A heuristic approximation algorithm of minimum dominating set based on rough set theory,"The minimum dominating set of graph has been widely used in many fields, but its solution is NP-hard. The complexity and approximation accuracy of existing algorithms need to be improved. In this paper, we introduce rough set theory to solve the dominating set of undirected graph. First, the adjacency matrix of undirected graph is used to establish an induced decision table, and the minimum dominating set of undirected graph is equivalent to the minimum attribute reduction of its induced decision table. Second, based on rough set theory, the significance of attributes (i.e., vertices) based on the approximate quality is defined in induced decision table, and a heuristic approximation algorithm of minimum dominating set is designed by using the significance of attributes (i.e., vertices) as heuristic information. This algorithm uses forward and backward search mechanism, which not only ensures to find a minimal dominating set, but also improves the approximation accuracy of minimum dominating set. In addition, a cumulative strategy is used to calculate the positive region of induced decision table, which effectively reduces the computational complexity. Finally, the experimental results on public datasets show that our algorithm has obvious advantages in running time and approximation accuracy of the minimum dominating set.","Lihe Guan

The Ryaod language is convenient in description of data processing problems, user formulation of the solution process, planning and execution of solutions, process control, and man-machine commication. The aggregate units of language operators and the linearity of the Ryaod program facilitate program adjustment and accelerate software development.The psychologically convenient language Dnepr [10] is based on β-calculus. The language is intended for performance of untypical data processing functions with the use of a data base. Dnepr is more effective for such tasks than Ryaod because data descriptions are not included in the application program, the language sentences are more compact, and the language which is oriented for operation with a video display can be learned faster.Compared with the other existing relational languages, Ryaod and Dnepr have a larger inventory of functional and service tools.",L.

The solution is constructed as a superposition of exact basis solutions of the Lame equation for a cylinder in coordinate systems fitted to the centers of the boundary surfaces of the body. The boundary conditions are exactly satisfied with the help of the apparatus of the generalized Fourier method. As a result, the original problem reduces to an infinite system of linear algebraic equations, which has a Fredholm operator in the Hilbert space l

1891,Renormalization in classical mechanics and many body quantum field theory,"We attempt to give apedagogical introduction to perturbative renormalization. Our approach is to first describe, following Linstedt and Poincaré, the renormalization of formal perturbation expansions for quasi-periodic orbits in Hamiltonian mechanics. We then discuss, following [FT1, FT2], the renormalization of the formal ground state energy density of a many Fermion system. The construction of formal quasi-periodic orbits is carried out in detail to provide a relatively simple model for the considerably more involved, and perhaps less familiar, perturbative analysis of a field theory.As we shall see, quasi-periodic orbits and many Fermion systems have a number of important features in common. In particular, as Poincaré observed in the classical case and [FT1, FT2] pointed out in the latter, the formal expansions considered here both contain divergent subseries.",Joel Feldman1 & Eugene Trubowitz,Journal d’Analyse Mathématique,1992,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02790365,"Fermi Surface,Thermodynamic Limit,Formal Power Series,Classical Mechanics,Real Analytic Function"

1893,On Using the Shell Theory in Stability Analysis of Fluid Flows in Compliant Pipes,"AbstractThe linear stability of the Poiseuille flow in a compliant pipe of circular cross-section is numerically analyzed using two different wall models based on the theory of thin shells. Small vibrations of the pipe wall are described by general Love’s equations in one model and by simplified Love’s equations derived using the well-known Donnell–Mushtari–Vlasov approximation in the other model. It is shown that the replacement of the general equations by the simplified ones does not qualitatively change the dependence of the basic flow stability characteristics on the wall stiffness and damping. Nevertheless, for some parameter values of the problem under consideration, this replacement can lead to the emergence of weakly growing disturbances, which are not observed in the case of general Love’s equations and are suppressed significantly by increasing wall the stiffness or damping.",K.

The control actions of the players are subject to geometric constraints. The game is formalized in classes of pure positional strategies with a memory of the motion history. It is proved that the game has a value and a saddle point. The proof is based on the choice of an appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional for the construction of control strategies by the method of an extremal shift to accompanying points.

The triviality of bundles arising from orthogonal representations of Γ is characterized completely as follows. An orthogonal representation gives rise to a trivial bundle if and only if the representation factors through the spinor groups. Furthermore, the subgroup of elements in the complex K-theory of BΓ which arises from complex unitary representations of Γ is shown to be trivial. In the case of real K-theory, the subgroup of elements which arises from real orthogonal representations of Γ is an elementary abelian 2-group, which is characterized completely in terms of the first two Stiefel-Whitney classes of the representation. In addition, quadratic relations in the cohomology algebra of the pure braid groups which correspond precisely to the Jacobi identity for certain choices of Poisson algebras are shown to give the existence of certain homomorphisms from the pure braid group to generalized Heisenberg groups. These cohomology relations correspond to non-trivial Spin representations of the pure braid groups which give rise to trivial bundles.","A. Adem1, D. Cohen2 & F.R.

Two expansions of the enhanced covariant base vectors are given: first an extension of the underlying single extensible shell kinematic and second an improvement of the membrane part of the bilinear element. Furthermore, two assumed strain modifications of the compatible covariant strains are introduced such that the element performs well even in the case of very thin shells.",P. Betsch1 & E.

Such first-order models cannot describe certain properties of population dynamics. General models with delays can account for all the observed dynamic complexities but are judged overgeneralized. It is proposed that the simplest model of intermediate complexity that explains such dynamic properties is a second-order model, which describes population dynamics as a function of a physiological variable, the dynamics of which in turn depends on resources.

This is considered to be the mirror of a (co)associative cycle in the context of mirror symmetry. The dDT connection is an analogue of a deformed Hermitian Yang–Mills (dHYM) connection which is extensively studied recently. In this paper, we study the moduli spaces of dDT and dHYM connections. In the former half, we prove that the deformation of dDT connections is controlled by a subcomplex of the canonical complex, an elliptic complex defined by Reyes Carrión, by introducing a new coclosed \(G_2\)-structure. If the deformation is unobstructed, we also show that the connected component of the moduli space is a \(b^{1}\)-dimensional torus, where \(b^{1}\) is the first Betti number of X. A canonical orientation on the moduli space is also given. We also prove that the obstruction of the deformation vanishes if we perturb the \(G_2\)-structure generically under some assumptions. In the latter half, we prove that the moduli space of dHYM connections, if it is nonempty, is a \(b^{1}\)-dimensional torus, especially, it is connected and orientable. We also prove the existence of a family of moduli spaces along a deformation of underlying structures if two cohomology classes vanish.","Kotaro Kawai1 & Hikaru Yamamoto

In Section 1 are defined certain algebraic notions related to the symmetric bilinear form (2iv) and which are necessary for the construction of any Galois theory. Necessary and sufficient condition for the extension of the domain of the operator Δα (this operator is not a derivation although it commutes with the partial derivations of the α-differential field) from an α-differential fieldK to a finitely generated α-differential extension field is given in Theorem 1.Section 2 defines the notion of α-differential mapping as linear mappings which preserve the symmetric bilinear form and commute with the partial derivations. The group properties of the set of α-differential mappings are discussed and the Galois correspondence theorems set up for α-differential fields.Section 3 sets up the notion of α-Liouvillian extensions of α-differential fields and briefly discusses the Galois groups associated with these α-Liouvillian extension fields.Section 4 points to the procedure for the algebraic characterization of ω-simple-α-differential field extensions by elementary solutions of the partial differential equationΔ

1912,A suggestion for a new approach to the mathematical theory of imitative behavior,"The theory of imitative behavior as developed hitherto by the author was based on the assumption that each individual has a natural preference for one of the two mutually exclusive behaviors. The endogenous fluctuations in the central nervous system then result in the individual’s exhibiting the two behaviors alternately with a relative frequency determined by the natural preference. Imitation shifts the natural preference towards one or the other of the two mutually exclusive behaviors. In the present approach it is suggested that the relative frequency of the two mutually exclusive behaviors exhibited alternately is determined by maximizing the “satisfaction function” of the individual, that is by hedonistic factors rather than by purely random fluctuations. Corresponding equations are developed. It is shown that in certain cases, even when the imitation effect is absent, a sort of “pseudoimitation” may occur. Another situation leads, in the case of two individuals only, to a complete “division of labor” between them, with respect to the two behaviors. Each one exhibits only one behavior. After that imitation is introduced explicitly by assuming that imitation by one individual or another increases the satisfaction function of the imitating individual. Results thus obtained show similarities to the results of the old theory.",N.

Unlike other theories, there are only four unknown functions involved, as compared to five in other shear deformation theories. The theory presented is variationally consistent and strongly similar to the classical plate theory in many aspects. It does not require the shear correction factor, and gives rise to the transverse shear stress variation so that the transverse shear stresses vary parabolically across the thickness to satisfy free surface conditions for the shear stress. Two common types of FGM sandwich plates are considered, namely, the sandwich with the FGM facesheet and the homogeneous core and the sandwich with the homogeneous facesheet and the FGM core. The equation of motion for the FGM sandwich plates is obtained based on Hamilton’s principle. The closed form solutions are obtained by using the Navier technique. The fundamental frequencies are found by solving the eigenvalue problems. The validity of the theory is shown by comparing the present results with those of the classical, the first-order, and the other higher-order theories. The proposed theory is accurate and simple in solving the free vibration behavior of the FGM sandwich plates.","L. Hadji1,2, H. A. Atmane1,3, A. Tounsi1, I. Mechab1 & …E. A.

To accomplish this aim, the micropolar theory is combined with the nonlocal elasticity.

For G without any p-torsion element we prove that Λ is an Auslander regular ring. This result enables us to give a good definition of the notion of a pseudo-nullΛ-module. This is classical when G=ℤk

1930,"Dynamical systems with variable dissipation: approaches, methods, and applications","This work is devoted to the development of qualitative methods in the theory of nonconservative systems that arise, e.g., in such fields of science as the dynamics of a rigid body interacting with a resisting medium, oscillation theory, etc. This material can arouse the interest of specialists in the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations, in rigid body dynamics, as well as in fluid and gas dynamics since the work uses the properties of motion of a rigid body in a medium under streamline flow-around conditions.The author obtains a full spectrum of complete integrability cases for nonconservative dynamical systems having nontrivial symmetries. Moreover, in almost all cases of integrability, each of the first integrals is expressed through a finite combination of elementary functions and is a transcendental function of its variables, simultaneously. In this case, the transcendence is meant in the complex analysis sense; i.e., after the continuation of the functions considered to the complex domain, they have essentially singular points. The latter fact is stipulated by the existence of attracting and repelling limit sets in the system considered (for example, attracting and repelling foci).The author obtains new families of phase portraits of systems with variable dissipation on lowerand higher-dimensional manifolds. He discusses the problems of their absolute or relative roughness, He discovers new integrable cases of rigid body motion, including those in the classical problem of motion of a spherical pendulum placed in an over-running medium flow.",M.

The purpose of this paper is to extend the iteration theory of transcendental entire functions to the quasiregular setting. As no examples of uniformly quasiregular maps of transcendental type are known, we work without the assumption of uniform quasiregularity. Here the Julia set is defined as the set of all points such that the complement of the forward orbit of any neighbourhood has capacity zero. It is shown that for maps which are not of polynomial type, the Julia set is non-empty and has many properties of the classical Julia set of transcendental entire functions.",Walter Bergweiler1 & Daniel A.

This is particularly important when boundaries are present since vorticity is typically generated at the boundary as a result of boundary layer separation. The boundary layer theory, developed by Prandtl about a hundred years ago, has become a standard tool in addressing these questions. Yet at the mathematical level, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of these questions and the validity of the boundary layer theory. In this article, we review recent progresses on the analysis of Prandtl's equation and the related issue of the zero-viscosity limit for the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation.

La composizione a destra con tale funzione definisce un operatore limitato in un conveniente spazio di Banach di funzioni. Nasce così un legame fra la Teoria dell'Iterazione e l'Analisi Funzionale. Si possono allora studiare semigruppi di operatori di composizione a destra ed inoltre si può introdurre una generalizzazione delle iterate a tempo frazionario e a tempo continuo: le iterate «phantom».In un'altra direzione si possono usare le equazioni funzionali-differenziali di J.

1937, A Korovkin-type theory for finite Toeplitz operators via matrix algebras," Preconditioned conjugate gradients (PCG) are widely and successfully used methods for solving a Toeplitz linear system \(A_n\vec{x}=\vec{b}\) [59,9,20,5,34,62,6,10,28,45,44,46,49]. Frobenius-optimal preconditioners are chosen in some proper matrix algebras and are defined by minimizing the Frobenius distance from \(A_n\). The convergence features of these PCG have been naturally studied by means of the Weierstrass–Jackson Theorem [17,36,45], owing to the profound relationship between the spectral features of the matrices \(A_n\), generated by the Fourier coefficients of a continuous function f, and the analytical properties of the symbol f itself. In this paper, we capsize this point of view by showing that the optimal preconditioners can be used to define both new and just known linear positive operators uniformly approximating the function f. On the other hand, by modifying the Korovkin Theorem to study the Frobenius-optimal preconditioning problem, we provide a new and unifying tool for analyzing all Frobenius-optimal preconditioners in any generic matrix algebra related to trigonometric transforms. Finally, the multilevel case is sketched and discussed by showing that a Korovkin-type Theory also holds in a multivariate sense.",Stefano Serra,Numerische Mathematik,1999,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002110050413,"Mathematics Subject Classification (1991):65F10, 47B25, 41A36, 15A18"

I will first analyse his definition of the implication and will show that this relation is not a consequence relation in his frame. Unlike the medieval logicians, he does not distinguish explicitly between material and formal consequences. The arguments discussed in al-Qiyās, where the conclusion is true only in some matters, and would seem close to a material consequence for that reason, are rejected explicitly as not syllogistic. He also rejects the ‘enthymemes’ unless they are complemented by their missing premise and the superfluous premises which, according to him, should promptly be ruled out. It seems then that the consequence relation in his theory is formal. It can be characterized as being ‘productivity in all matters’ or ‘necessary truth preserving’. It is illustrated by some (but not all) single premise arguments, and above all by all kinds of syllogisms which, in his theory, are more numerous and various than in Aristotle’s one. The syllogism may contain two or more premises, including disjunctive ones. When it is hypothetical, it may lead to several conclusions. The premises may be in conflict, but then, the conclusion is false. He thus rejects the principle according to which ‘anything follows from a contradiction’. But, unlike what some scholars say, he does not admit any connexive principle. In the compound syllogisms, the conclusion follows by steps, each step taking two premises at once.",Saloua Chatti,Logica Universalis,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11787-018-0210-y,"Primary 01-02,Secondary 03A05,03B99"

1953,Newform theory for Hilbert Eisenstein series,"In his thesis, Weisinger (Thesis, 1977) developed a newform theory for elliptic modular Eisenstein series. This newform theory for Eisenstein series was later extended to the Hilbert modular setting by Wiles (Ann. Math. 123(3):407–456, 1986). In this paper, we extend the theory of newforms for Hilbert modular Eisenstein series. In particular, we provide a strong multiplicity-one theorem in which we prove that Hilbert Eisenstein newforms are uniquely determined by their Hecke eigenvalues for any set of primes having Dirichlet density greater than \(\frac{1}{2}\). Additionally, we provide a number of applications of this newform theory. Let  denote the space of Hilbert modular Eisenstein series of parallel weight k≥3, level \(\mathcal{N}\) and Hecke character Ψ over a totally real field K. For any prime \(\mathfrak{q}\) dividing \(\mathcal{N}\), we define an operator \(C_{\mathfrak{q}}\) generalizing the Hecke operator \(T_{\mathfrak{q}}\) and prove a multiplicity-one theorem for  with respect to the algebra generated by the Hecke operators \(T_{\mathfrak{p}}\) ( \(\mathfrak{p}\nmid\mathcal{N}\)) and the operators \(C_{\mathfrak{q}}\) (\(\mathfrak{q}\mid\mathcal{N}\)). We conclude by examining the behavior of Hilbert Eisenstein newforms under twists by Hecke characters, proving a number of results having a flavor similar to those of Atkin and Li (Invent.

1954,"Minimum-correction second-moment matching: theory, algorithms and applications","We address the problem of finding the closest matrix \(\tilde{\varvec{U}}\) to a given \(\varvec{U}\) under the constraint that a prescribed second-moment matrix \(\tilde{\varvec{P}}\) must be matched, i.e. \(\tilde{\varvec{U}}^{\mathrm {T}}\tilde{\varvec{U}}=\tilde{\varvec{P}}\). We obtain a closed-form formula for the unique global optimizer \(\tilde{\varvec{U}}\) for the full-rank case, that is related to \(\varvec{U}\) by an SPD (symmetric positive definite) linear transform. This result is generalized to rank-deficient cases as well as to infinite dimensions. We highlight the geometric intuition behind the theory and study the problem’s rich connections to minimum congruence transform, generalized polar decomposition, optimal transport, and rank-deficient data assimilation. In the special case of \(\tilde{\varvec{P}}=\varvec{I}\), minimum-correction second-moment matching reduces to the well-studied optimal orthonormalization problem. We investigate the general strategies for numerically computing the optimizer and analyze existing polar decomposition and matrix square root algorithms. We modify and stabilize two Newton iterations previously deemed unstable for computing the matrix square root, such that they can now be used to efficiently compute both the orthogonal polar factor and the SPD square root. We then verify the higher performance of the various new algorithms using benchmark cases with randomly generated matrices. Lastly, we complete two applications for the stochastic Lorenz-96 dynamical system in a chaotic regime.

1955,Theory of the solvent effect in dipole moment measurements,"1. The ideas leading up to Raman and Krishnan’s theory of anisotropic field constants prevailing in a liquid medium are briefly recounted.2. On the basis of this theory a rigorous expression is derived for the polarisation of a solute in infinite dilution in a non-polar solvent, after eliminating the influence of the solvent.3. This equation is successfully applied to the data on the polarisation of nitro-benzene in different solvents.4. It is shown that the several empirical equations proposed to represent the solvent influence on the polarisation of the solute, all closely resemble the rigorous expression derived from the theory of Raman and Krishnan.","M.

We consider a cumulative prospect theory investor in a single period setting with one riskless bond and multiple risky stocks, which follow a multivariate elliptical distribution. Our main result is a two-fund separation between the riskless bond and a mean–variance-portfolio, up to an exogenous benchmark portfolio. The mean–variance-portfolio, which we derive explicitly, is the same for all agents. Individual risk preferences are mirrored only in the participation in this portfolio. This dependence is illustrated by considering empirical returns. Furthermore we solve ill-posed optimization problems by imposing a regulatory risk constraint.

1961,A general theory of coexistence and extinction for stochastic ecological communities,"We analyze a general theory for coexistence and extinction of ecological communities that are influenced by stochastic temporal environmental fluctuations. The results apply to discrete time (stochastic difference equations), continuous time (stochastic differential equations), compact and non-compact state spaces and degenerate or non-degenerate noise. In addition, we can also include in the dynamics auxiliary variables that model environmental fluctuations, population structure, eco-environmental feedbacks or other internal or external factors. We are able to significantly generalize the recent discrete time results by Benaim and Schreiber (J Math Biol 79:393–431, 2019) to non-compact state spaces, and we provide stronger persistence and extinction results. The continuous time results by Hening and Nguyen (Ann Appl Probab 28(3):1893–1942, 2018a) are strengthened to include degenerate noise and auxiliary variables. Using the general theory, we work out several examples. In discrete time, we classify the dynamics when there are one or two species, and look at the Ricker model, Log-normally distributed offspring models, lottery models, discrete Lotka–Volterra models as well as models of perennial and annual organisms. For the continuous time setting we explore models with a resource variable, stochastic replicator models, and three dimensional Lotka–Volterra models.","Alexandru Hening1, Dang H.

The algorithm, called HDDP, is a hybrid variant of differential dynamic programming, a proven second-order technique that relies on Bellman’s Principle of Optimality and successive minimization of quadratic approximations. The new hybrid method incorporates nonlinear mathematical programming techniques to increase efficiency: quadratic programming subproblems are solved via trust region and range-space active set methods, an augmented Lagrangian cost function is utilized, and a multiphase structure is implemented. In addition, the algorithm decouples the optimization from the dynamics using first- and second-order state transition matrices.

As in any integral method the results obtained are approximate in nature. Nonetheless, comparison with experimental data shows good agreement in cases for which experimental data are available. The method can easily be used to determine the lift on wings of finite aspect ratio and also to solve transient lifting problems. The method is demonstrated by solving for the pressure distribution on a lifting airfoil of arbitrary symmetric cross-section, the lift on a wing of rectangular planform, and the transient lift on an airfoil due to a sudden change in angle of attack. These cases were chosen to illustrate the versatility of the method and are not meant to be exhaustive of all possibilities.

1966,Conventional/unconventional superconductivity in high-pressure hydrides and beyond: insights from theory and perspectives,"The observation of a superconducting critical temperature \(T_\mathrm{c}\) exceeding 200K in ultra-dense hydrogen sulfide has demonstrated that high-\(T_\mathrm{c}\) superconductivity can be achieved also in compounds where the superconducting pairing is mediated by phonons. This poses interesting challenges and opportunities. In particular, in this paper, we present a theoretical overview of the following points:

Density functional theory has been quite effective in predicting various structures and this was the first time that theory has been successful in predicting novel superconductors. Along this line, we use DFT and many body theory to discuss possible strategies to search for new high-\(T_\mathrm{c}\) superconductors in light-element compounds at high pressures [20, 34, 36, 37, 43].


The microscopic key elements for high \({T}_\mathrm{c}\) seem to be a high phonon frequency, a peak in the density of states, a large el-ph coupling due to strong bonds, and the avoidance of lattice instabilities for very large couplings. The first two points lead to an appreciable Migdal parameter and to the possibility that non-adiabatic effects may require the generalization of the standard Migdal–Eliashberg theory of superconductivity [32, 33, 45].


In this perspective, it would be important to locate these materials in the Uemura diagram and to measure isotope effect for \({T}_\mathrm{c}\) but also for the effective electron mass and the magnetic susceptibility [31], where the standard ME theory would give zero effect.


The possibility of going beyond ME theory adds a new dimension also in the perspective of exporting these concepts to other materials at ambient or low pressure. For example, carbon compounds have a phonon frequency similar to the hydrides and the coupling can also be strong. This points to a search towards fullerene, graphene, or doped graphane. In these materials, especially fullerene, the Fermi energy is very small and the system is certainly in the non-adiabatic regime [31,32,33, 45].

1968,Design Theory from the Viewpoint of Algebraic Combinatorics,"We give a survey on various design theories from the viewpoint of algebraic combinatorics. We will start with the following themes.

(i)
The similarity between spherical t-designs and combinatorial t-designs, as well as t-designs in Q-polynomial association schemes.


(ii)
Euclidean t-designs as a two-step generalization of spherical t-designs.


(iii)
Relative t-designs as a two-step generalization of t-designs in Q-polynomial association schemes, and the similarity with Euclidean t-designs.


(iv)
Fisher type lower bounds for the sizes of these designs as well as the classification problems of some of tight t-designs and/or tight relative t-designs.

 Our emphasis will be focused on the proposal to study relative t-designs, mostly tight relative t-designs, in known classical examples of P- and Q-polynomial association schemes. We relate our study with the representation theoretical aspect of the relevant association schemes and permutation groups, due to Charles Dunkl and Dennis Stanton and others. We propose several open problems, which seem to play a key role in this research direction. We also put emphasis on the future research directions in this research area and not on presenting the details of the established results on the study of design theory. In particular, we propose to study t-designs in each shell of these classical P- and Q-polynomial association schemes. In general, each shell is not Q-polynomial. It may be even non-commutative in some cases. The importance of the use of Terwilliger algebras in the study of relative t-designs in such association schemes will also be highlighted.","Eiichi Bannai1, Etsuko Bannai2, Hajime Tanaka

The conservation laws impose stringent restrictions on the possible equations which may describe the motion of the point charge.If it is required that higher derivatives of the velocity than the second should not appear explicitly in these equations, then the choice is unique and the only possible equations are those originally derived by Lorentz. If the third derivative is allowed to appear explicitly in the equations, but no thigher ones, then it is possible to give one other system of equations for describing the behaviour of a point singularity which can be used without entirely artificial initial and final conditions.",H.

The authors assume that both the attacker and defender have two typical strategies: Targeted strategy and random strategy. The authors explore the Nash equilibriums of the attacker-defender game and demonstrate that when the attacker’s attack resources are not so significantly abundant as the defender?s resources, there exists a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in both model networks and real-world networks, in which the defender protects the hub targets with large degrees preferentially, while the attacker prefers selecting the targets randomly. When the attack resources are much higher than defense resources, both the attacker and the defender adopt the targeted strategy in equilibriums. This paper provides a new theoretical framework for the study of attack and defense strategies in complex networks.","Yapeng Li1, Ye Deng1, Yu Xiao1 & …Jun Wu",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-019-7420-0,"Attack and defense strategies,attacker-defender game,complex networks,Nash equilibriums"

n+1 all of whose developable surfaces are either plane or conic. The purely geometric classification of systems of two conservation laws of the Temple class is given in Sec. 5 and the results of Secs. 6 and 7 give us hope that an effective solution of this problem will be obtained in the more complicated casen≥3.

To study the systems of conservation laws corresponding to certain projectively invariant classes ofn-parameter families of straight lines inA
n+1. Forn=2, this is nothing but the translation of theTheory of Congruences [11] into the language of systems of convervation laws.

When M=  and E=  H∞(E) is the free semigroup algebra studied by Popescu, Davidson and Pitts and many others. We show that given any faithful normal representation σ of M on a Hilbert space H there is a natural correspondence Eσ over the commutant σ(M)′, called the σ-dual of E, and that H∞(E) can be realized in terms of (B(H)-valued) functions on the open unit ball ((Eσ)*) in the space of adjoints of elements in Eσ. We prove analogues of the Nevanlinna-Pick theorem in this setting and discover other aspects of the value ‘‘distribution theory’’ for elements in H∞(E). We also analyze the ‘‘boundary behavior’’ of elements in H∞(E) and obtain generalizations of the Sz.-Nagy–Foiaş functional calculus and the functional calculus of Popescu for c.n.c. row contractions.

It is shown that the rate of convergence of the p-version is always at least that of the h-version (measured in terms of number of degrees of freedom used). If the solution is very smooth then the p-version attains an exponential rate of convergence. If the solution has certain types of singularity, the rate of convergence of the p-version is twice that of the h-version. The analysis generalises the work of Babuska and others to the case \(q\not=2\). In addition, the approximation theoretic results find immediate application for some types of spectral and spectral element methods.",Mark Ainsworth1 & David Kay,Numerische Mathematik,1999,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002110050423,"Mathematics Subject Classification (1991):65N15, 65N30"

1992,Sturm theory with applications in geometry and classical mechanics,"Classical Sturm non-oscillation and comparison theorems as well as the Sturm theorem on zeros for solutions of second order differential equations have a natural symplectic version, since they describe the rotation of a line in the phase plane of the equation. In the higher dimensional symplectic version of these theorems, lines are replaced by Lagrangian subspaces and intersections with a given line are replaced by non-transversality instants with a distinguished Lagrangian subspace. Thus the symplectic Sturm theorems describe some properties of the Maslov index. Starting from the celebrated paper of Arnol’d on symplectic Sturm theory for optical Hamiltonians, we provide a generalization of his results to general Hamiltonians. We finally apply these results for detecting some geometrical information about the distribution of conjugate and focal points on semi-Riemannian manifolds and for studying the geometrical properties of the solutions space of singular Lagrangian systems arising in Celestial Mechanics.","Vivina L.

It led to such striking applications as the solution of the Milnor conjecture and the Bloch-Kato conjecture on the Galois symbol. Since then the theory has turned to a systematic study of its basic invariants and structures, as well as providing numerous new applications. Morel, Cisinski-Déglise, and Röndigs-Østvær have described the relation of the motivic stable homotopy category to Voevodskys triangulated category of motives. Morel’s computation of the endomorphism of the sphere spectrum points out a close relationship to quadratic forms, and has given rise to the construction of interesting new oriented cycle theories. Asok and Fasel have applied computations of unstable motivic homotopy groups to stability problems for algebraic vector bundles. Isaksen and others have computed motivic versions of Adams-Novikov and Adams spectral sequences, and used this information to improve known computations of these spectral sequences in classical homotopy theory. We will discuss the basic ideas going into the construction of motivic homotopy theory and some of these results and applications.",Marc Levine,Acta Mathematica Vietnamica,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40306-016-0184-x,"Homotopy theory,Motives,Quadratic forms,Homtopy groups of spheres"
1994,A further note on the force discrepancy for wing theory in Euler flow,"Uniform steady potential flow past a wing aligned at a small angle to the flow direction is considered. The standard approach is to model this by a vortex sheet, approximated by a finite distribution of horseshoe vortices. In the limit as the span of the horseshoe vortices tends to zero, an integral distribution of infinitesimal horseshoe vortices over the vortex sheet is obtained. The contribution to the force on the wing due to the presence of one of the infinitesimal horseshoe vortices in the distribution is focused upon. Most of the algebra in the force calculation is evaluated using Maple software and is given in the appendices. As in the two previous papers by the authors on wing theory in Euler flow [E Chadwick, A slender-wing theory in potential flow, Proc. R. Soc. A461 (2005) 415–432, and E Chadwick and A Hatam, The physical interpretation of the lift discrepancy in Lanchester-Prandtl lifting wing theory for Euler flow, leading to the proposal of an alternative model in Oseen flow, Proc.

While the regression problem has been studied for static graphs and temporal graphs, it is not investigated for general dynamic graphs. In this paper, we study the theory of regression over dynamic graphs. First, we present the notion of update-efficient matrix embedding, that defines conditions sufficient for a matrix embedding to be effectively used for dynamic graph regression (under \(l_2\) norm). Then, we show that given a \(n \times m\) update-efficient matrix embedding (e.g., the adjacency matrix) and after an update operation in the graph, the exact optimal solution of linear regression can be updated in O(nm) time for the revised graph. Moreover, we show that this also holds when the matrix embedding is the Laplacian matrix and the update operations are restricted to edge insertion/deletion. In the end, by conducting experiments over synthetic and real-world graphs, we show the high efficiency of updating the solution of graph regression.","Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani

A typical factor of the secular equation is then obtained and it is found that it corresponds to the vibration of the two component cubic facecentred lattices composing the diamond lattice relative to one another, each being considered as rigid. The said vibration is triply degenerate. It appears that this vibration is Raman-active but optically inactive since all the atoms are homonuclear. Hence an explanation for the origin of the principal Raman line with the shift 1332 cm.−1 and the absence of the infra-red band corresponding to 1332 cm.−1 follows.",N. S.

1998,Introducing pre-impact air-cushioning effects into the Wagner model of impact theory,"In this analysis, we consider the effects of non-quiescent initial conditions driven by pre-impact air–water interactions on the classical Wagner model of impact theory. We consider the problem of a rigid, solid impactor moving vertically towards a liquid pool. Prior to impact, viscous forces in the air act to deform the liquid free surface, inducing a flow in the pool. These interactions are then incorporated as initial conditions in the post-impact analysis. We derive expressions for the size of the effective contact set, the leading-order pressure and force on the impactor, and the speed and thickness of the jet at its base. In all cases, we show that the effect of the pre-impact behaviour is to cushion the impactor, reducing the size of the effective contact set and, hence, the force on the impactor. Small- and large-time asymptotic solutions are derived for general power-law impactors, and we show that the effects of the air die away as the impact progresses, so that we approach the classical Wagner solution.","Matthew R.

2011,Explore Stochastic Instabilities of Periodic Points by Transition Path Theory,"We consider the noise-induced transitions from a linearly stable periodic orbit consisting of T periodic points in randomly perturbed discrete logistic map. Traditional large deviation theory and asymptotic analysis at small noise limit cannot distinguish the quantitative difference in noise-induced stochastic instabilities among the T periodic points. To attack this problem, we generalize the transition path theory to the discrete-time continuous-space stochastic process. In our first criterion to quantify the relative instability among T periodic points, we use the distribution of the last passage location related to the transitions from the whole periodic orbit to a prescribed disjoint set. This distribution is related to individual contributions to the transition rate from each periodic points. The second criterion is based on the competency of the transition paths associated with each periodic point. Both criteria utilize the reactive probability current in the transition path theory. Our numerical results for the logistic map reveal the transition mechanism of escaping from the stable periodic orbit and identify which periodic point is more prone to lose stability so as to make successful transitions under random perturbations.","Yu Cao1, Ling Lin2 & Xiang Zhou

In the present paper we consider the following question: do there exist 3 polynomial functions \(f_1\), \(f_2\), \(f_3\) on \({\mathbf {R}}^{3n}\) such that the intersection of the set of common zeros of \(f_1\), \(f_2\), and \(f_3\) with each orbit of SO(3) in \({\mathbf {R}}^{3n}\) is nonempty and finite? Questions of this kind arise when one is interested in relative motions of a given set of n points, i. e., when one wants to exclude the local motions of the system of points as a rigid body. An example is the problem of deciding whether a given polyhedron is non-trivially flexible. We prove that such functions do exist.

A language is associated with each pair of sets where the first set consists of double-stranded DNA molecules and the second set consists of the recombinational behaviors allowed by specified classes of enzymatic activities. The associated language consists of strings of symbols that represent the primary structures of the DNA molecules that may potentially arise from the original set of DNA molecules under the given enzymatic activities.Attention is focused on the potential effect of sets of restriction enzymes and a ligase that allow DNA molecules to be cleaved and reassociated to produce further molecules. The associated languages are analysed by means of a new generative formalism called a splicing system. A significant subclass of these languages, which we call the persistent splicing languages, is shown to coincide with a class of regular languages which have been previously studied in other contexts: the strictly locally testable languages.This study initiates the formal analysis of the generative power of recombinational behaviors in general.

2042,History of the Lenz-Ising Model 1920–1950: From Ferromagnetic to Cooperative Phenomena,"I chart the considerable changes in the status and conception of the Lenz-Ising model from 1920 to 1950 in terms of three phases: In the early 1920s, Lenz and Ising introduced the model in the field of ferromagnetism. Based on an exact derivation, Ising concluded that it is incapable of displaying ferromagnetic behavior, a result he erroneously extended to three dimensions. In the next phase, Lenz and Ising’s contemporaries rejected the model as a representation of ferromagnetic materials because of its conflict with the new quantum mechanics. In the third phase, from the early 1930s to the early 1940s, the model was revived as a model of cooperative phenomena. I provide more detail on this history than the earlier accounts of Brush (1967) and Hoddeson, Schubert, Heims, and Baym (1992) and question some of their conclusions. Moreover, my account differs from these in its focus on the development of the model in its capacity as a model. It examines three aspects of this development: (1) the attitudes on the degree of physical realism of the Lenz-Ising model in its representation of physical phenomena; (2) the various reasons for studying and using it; and (3) the effect of the change in its theoretical basis during the transition from the old to the new quantum mechanics. A major theme of my study is that even though the Lenz-Ising model is not fully realistic, it is more useful than more realistic models because of its mathematical tractability. I argue that this point of view, important for the modern conception of the model, is novel and that its emergence, while perhaps not a consequence of its study, is coincident with the third phase of its development.",Martin Niss,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-004-0088-3,"Quantum Mechanic,Theoretical Basis,Physical Phenomenon,Realistic Model,Major Theme"
2043,Intersection homology theory via rectifiable currents,Here is given a rectifiable currents’ version of intersection homology theory on stratified subanalytic pseudomanifolds. This new version enables one to study some variational problems on stratified subanalytic pseudomanifolds. We first achieve an isomorphism between this rectifiable currents’ version and the version using subanalytic chains. Then we define a suitably modified mass on the complex of rectifiable currents to ensure that each sequence of subanalytic chains with bounded modified mass has a convegent subsequence and the limit rectifiable current still satisfies the perversity condition of the approximating chains. The associated mass minimizers turn out to be almost minimal currents and this fact leads to some regularity results.,Qinglan Xia,Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations,2004,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00526-003-0222-0,"Variational Problem,Regularity Result,Modify Mass,Mass Minimizer,Homology Theory"

2050,Global optimization of truss topology with discrete bar areas—Part I: theory of relaxed problems,"
This two part paper considers the classical problem of finding a truss design with minimal compliance subject to a given external force and a volume bound. The design variables describe the cross-section areas of the bars. While this problem is well-studied for continuous bar areas, we treat here the case of discrete areas. This problem is of major practical relevance if the truss must be built from pre-produced bars with given areas. As a special case, we consider the design problem for a single bar area, i.e., a 0/1-problem.

In contrast to heuristic methods considered in other approaches, Part I of the paper together with Part II present an algorithmic framework for the calculation of a global optimizer of the underlying large-scaled mixed integer design problem. This framework is given by a convergent branch-and-bound algorithm which is based on solving a sequence of nonconvex continuous relaxations. The main issue of the paper and of the approach lies in the fact that the relaxed nonlinear optimization problem can be formulated as a quadratic program (QP). Here the paper generalizes and extends the available theory from the literature. Although the Hessian of this QP is indefinite, it is possible to circumvent the non-convexity and to calculate global optimizers. Moreover, the QPs to be treated in the branch-and-bound search tree differ from each other just in the objective function.

In Part I we give an introduction to the problem and collect all theory and related proofs for the treatment of the original problem formulation and the continuous relaxed problems. The implementation details and convergence proof of the branch-and-bound methodology and the large-scale numerical examples are presented in Part II.

From the viewpoint of FOL, we regard a diagram as a deductively closed conjunction of certain FOL formulas. On the basis of this observation, we first investigate basic heterogeneous logic (HL) wherein heterogeneous inference rules are defined in the styles of conjunction introduction and elimination rules of FOL. By examining what is a detour in our heterogeneous proofs, we discuss that an elimination-introduction pair of rules constitutes a redex in our HL, which is opposite the usual redex in FOL. In terms of the notion of a redex, we prove the normalization theorem for HL, and we give a characterization of the structure of heterogeneous proofs. Every normal proof in our HL consists of applications of introduction rules followed by applications of elimination rules, which is also opposite the usual form of normal proofs in FOL. Thereafter, we extend the basic HL by extending the heterogeneous rule in the style of general elimination rules to include a wider range of heterogeneous systems.

This equivalence implies that the ring spectra, algebra spectra, and module spectra constructed via these two classical algebraic K-theory functors are equivalent as ring, algebra or module spectra, respectively. It also allows for comparisons of spectrally enriched categories constructed via these definitions of K-theory. As both the Elmendorf–Mandell and Blumberg–Mandell multiplicative versions of K-theory encode their multiplicativity in the language of multicategories, our main theorem is that there is multinatural transformation relating these two symmetric multifunctors that lifts the classical functor from Segal’s to Waldhausen’s construction.

Important classes of groups, including all permutation representations of simple groups except the alternating ones, as well as most primitive groups, belong to this category.

2072,"A derivative-free exact penalty algorithm: basic ideas, convergence theory and computational studies","We present a trust-region method for the solution of constrained optimization problems where the gradients of the objective and constraints are not available. As this is a penalty method, infeasible iterates may be accepted, and the constraints need not be known explicitly, allowing to build constraint models through the optimization procedure. By the use of an exact penalty, under certain conditions for feasible problems, the method converges directly to a constrained optimum, once a sufficiently high penalty is selected. To address the fact that the \(\ell _1\)-penalty used is not in general differentiable near the active constraints, steps are computed in directions with guaranteed descent. A numerical comparison with other algorithms is presented for a set of analytical test problems, showing that the proposed algorithm achieves good performance. Computational results from a problem where the objective and constraint functions are the result of a simulation are also presented. The method is particularly appropriate for modestly sized problems where the computation of the search direction is not too expensive.","Caio Merlini Giuliani

2074,On the changing concept of evolutionary population stability as a reflection of a changing point of view in the quantitative theory of evolution,"Eighteen different terms, currently employed to define various concepts of evolutionary stability in population dynamics are mentioned in this paper. Most of these terms are used in different connotations and even different meanings by different authors. On the other hand, different terms are often employed by different authors to define quite the same concept. Twenty-five years ago there was only one, well-defined, concept of stability, universally recognized in the field. In this paper I will try to relate the recent confusion, concerning concepts of population stability, with a more serious, though not that well-recognized, confusion in the modern analytic approach to population dynamics and quantitative evolution. Concepts of population stability will be examined in relation to each other on the one hand and, on the other hand, in relation to two dichotomies regarding the dynamic processes to which they correspond: Short-term versus long-term processes and processes concerning phenotypic changes versus process concerning genotypic changes. A hopefully more consistent use of the current terminology is suggested.",Ilan Eshel,Journal of Mathematical Biology,1996,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02409747,"Dynamic stability,ESS,Short-term stability,Long-term stability"
2075,"Minimization of transformed \(L_1\) penalty: theory, difference of convex function algorithm, and robust application in compressed sensing","We study the minimization problem of a non-convex sparsity promoting penalty function, the transformed \(l_1\) (TL1), and its application in compressed sensing (CS). The TL1 penalty interpolates \(l_0\) and \(l_1\) norms through a nonnegative parameter \(a \in (0,+\infty )\), similar to \(l_p\) with \(p \in (0,1]\), and is known to satisfy unbiasedness, sparsity and Lipschitz continuity properties. We first consider the constrained minimization problem, and discuss the exact recovery of \(l_0\) norm minimal solution based on the null space property (NSP). We then prove the stable recovery of \(l_0\) norm minimal solution if the sensing matrix A satisfies a restricted isometry property (RIP). We formulated a normalized problem to overcome the lack of scaling property of the TL1 penalty function. For a general sensing matrix A, we show that the support set of a local minimizer corresponds to linearly independent columns of A. Next, we present difference of convex algorithms for TL1 (DCATL1) in computing TL1-regularized constrained and unconstrained problems in CS. The DCATL1 algorithm involves outer and inner loops of iterations, one time matrix inversion, repeated shrinkage operations and matrix-vector multiplications. The inner loop concerns an \(l_1\) minimization problem on which we employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. For the unconstrained problem, we prove convergence of DCATL1 to a stationary point satisfying the first order optimality condition. In numerical experiments, we identify the optimal value \(a=1\), and compare DCATL1 with other CS algorithms on two classes of sensing matrices: Gaussian random matrices and over-sampled discrete cosine transform matrices (DCT). Among existing algorithms, the iterated reweighted least squares method based on \(l_{1/2}\) norm is the best in sparse recovery for Gaussian matrices, and the DCA algorithm based on \(l_1\) minus \(l_2\) penalty is the best for over-sampled DCT matrices. We find that for both classes of sensing matrices, the performance of DCATL1 algorithm (initiated with \(l_1\) minimization) always ranks near the top (if not the top), and is the most robust choice insensitive to the conditioning of the sensing matrix A. DCATL1 is also competitive in comparison with DCA on other non-convex penalty functions commonly used in statistics with two hyperparameters.",Shuai Zhang1 & Jack Xin,Mathematical Programming,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-018-1236-x,"Transformed \(l_1\) penalty,Sparse signal recovery theory,Difference of convex function algorithm,Convergence analysis,Coherent random matrices,Compressed sensing,Robust recovery"

2079,A Bayes-optimal sequence-structure theory that unifies protein sequence-structure recognition and alignment,"A rigorous Bayesian analysis is presented that unifies protein sequence-structure alignment and recognition. Given a sequence, explicit formulae are derived to select (1) its globally most probable core structure from a structure library; (2) its globally most probable alignment to a given core structure; (3) its most probable joint core structure and alignment chosen globally across the entire library; and (4) its most probable individual segments, secondary structure, and super-secondary structures across the entire library. The computations involved are NP-hard in the general case (3D-3D). Fast exact recursions for the restricted sequence singleton-only (1D-3D) case are given. Conclusions include: (a) the most probable joint core structure and alignment is not necessarily the most probable alignment of the most probable core structure, but rather maximizes the product of core and alignment probabilities; (b) use of a sequence-independent linear or affine gap penalty may result in the highest-probability threading not having the lowest score; (c) selecting the most probable core structure from the library (core structure selection or fold recognition only) involves comparing probabilities summed over all possible alignments of the sequence to the core, and not comparing individual optimal (or near-optimal) sequence-structure alignments; and (d) assuming uninformative priors, core structure selection is equivalent to comparing the ratio of two global means.","Richard H.

2080,"Density, Overcompleteness, and Localization of Frames. I. Theory","Frames have applications in numerous fields of mathematics and engineering. The fundamental property of frames which makes them so useful is their overcompleteness. In most applications, it is this overcompleteness that is exploited to yield a decomposition that is more stable, more robust, or more compact than is possible using nonredundant systems. This work presents a quantitative framework for describing the overcompleteness of frames. It introduces notions of localization and approximation between two frames \({\frak F} = \{f_i\}_{i\in I}\) and \({\frak E} = \{e_j\}_{j\in G}\) (\(G\) a discrete
abelian group), relating the decay of the expansion of the elements of \({\frak F}\) in terms of the elements of \({\frak E}\) via a map \(a : I \rightarrow G\). A fundamental set of equalities are shown between three seemingly unrelated quantities: The relative measure of \({\frak F}\), the relative measure of \({\frak E}\) — both of which are determined by certain averages of inner products of frame elements with their corresponding dual frame elements — and the density of the set \(a(I)\) in \(G\). Fundamental new results are obtained on the excess and overcompleteness of frames, on the relationship between frame bounds and density, and on the structure of the dual frame of a localized frame. In a subsequent article, these results are applied to the case of Gabor frames, producing an array of new results as well as clarifying the meaning of existing results. The notion of localization and related approximation properties introduced in this article are a spectrum of ideas that quantify the degree to which elements of one frame can be approximated by elements of another frame. A comprehensive examination of the interrelations among these localization and approximation concepts is presented.","Radu Balan1, Peter G.

2083,Markov–Dubins path via optimal control theory,"Markov–Dubins path is the shortest planar curve joining two points with prescribed tangents, with a specified bound on its curvature. Its structure, as proved by Dubins in 1957, nearly 70 years after Markov posed the problem of finding it, is elegantly simple: a selection of at most three arcs are concatenated, each of which is either a circular arc of maximum (prescribed) curvature or a straight line. The Markov–Dubins problem and its variants have since been extensively studied in practical and theoretical settings. A reformulation of the Markov–Dubins problem as an optimal control problem was subsequently studied by various researchers using the Pontryagin maximum principle and additional techniques, to reproduce Dubins’ result. In the present paper, we study the same reformulation, and apply the maximum principle, with new insights, to derive Dubins’ result again. We prove that abnormal control solutions do exist. We characterize these solutions, which were not studied adequately in the literature previously, as a concatenation of at most two circular arcs and show that they are also solutions of the normal problem. Moreover, we prove that any feasible path of the types mentioned in Dubins’ result is a stationary solution, i.e., that it satisfies the Pontryagin maximum principle. We propose a numerical method for computing Markov–Dubins path. We illustrate the theory and the numerical approach by three qualitatively different examples.","C. Yalçın Kaya

In this paper, the linear stability theory (LST) with the equivalent spanwise wavenumber correction (ESWC) is proposed in order to accurately predict the linear evolution of a disturbance in a kind of boundary layer flow with a vital variation in the spanwise direction. The LST with the ESWC takes not only the scale of the mean flow with the significant variation but also the wavenumber evolution of the disturbance itself. Compared with the conventional LST, the results obtained by the new method are in excellent agreement with those of the numerical simulations. The LST with the ESWC is an effective method on the prediction of the disturbance evolution in 3D boundary layers, which improves the prediction of the LST in the applications to complex 3D boundary layers greatly.","Runjie Song1, Shaolong Zhang2 & Jianxin Liu",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-019-2450-6,"three-dimensional (3D) boundary layer,prediction of disturbance propagation,equivalent spanwise wavenumber,linear stability theory (LST),numerical simulation"

Some conclusions of the previous study remain valid although some modifications must be made.

2105,The bimodal theory of plasticity II: polar material response,"Based on arguments of the invariant theory of tensor representations, the first part of this study [Soldatos, J Mech Phys Solids 59:1576–1595, 2011] generalised the experimentally established theory of bimodal plasticity in a manner which elucidates its physical and mathematical connection with the plasticity theory of ideal fibre-reinforced solids. The present, second, part of the study deals with a major relevant question which remains unanswered and refers to the considerable deviation which the plastic-strain vector has shown in experiments from the normal to the yield surface direction. The described flow rule discrepancy is resolved here by reconsidering the standard assumption of perfectly flexible fibres. All previously established experimental and theoretical results and observations which refer to bimodal plasticity remain intact and guide this investigation, which, however, postulates further that strong fibres possess bending stiffness. In turn, fibre resistance in bending implies the presence of couple stress and non-symmetric stress, and as a result, the plastic response of the fibrous composite acquires features of polar material behaviour. The resulting polar material version of the bimodal plasticity model provides a convincing explanation, as well as the reasons behind the failure of symmetric-stress (non-polar material) plasticity to conform to well-known and well-established principles of plastic flow. It is thus seen that if polar plastic behaviour is erroneously described with arguments of symmetric-stress plasticity, the corresponding experimental or theoretical measurements become relevant to a scaled rather than the actual yield surface. Those two surfaces resemble each other closely, but, in agreement with existing experimental evidence, their normal directions are generally different. Experimental verification of this kind of polar plastic behaviour may accordingly become possible by measuring simultaneously the values of shear-stress components acting along as well as across fibres throughout the loading process of a relevant fibrous composite specimen.",Kostas P.

2119,"Kirchhoff’s theory for optical diffraction, its predecessor and subsequent development: the resilience of an inconsistent theory","Kirchhoff’s 1882 theory of optical diffraction forms the centerpiece in the long-term development of wave optics, one that commenced in the 1820s when Fresnel produced an empirically successful theory based on a reinterpretation of Huygens’ principle, but without working from a wave equation. Then, in 1856, Stokes demonstrated that the principle was derivable from such an equation albeit without consideration of boundary conditions. Kirchhoff’s work a quarter century later marked a crucial, and widely influential, point for he produced Fresnel’s results by means of Green’s theorem and function under specific boundary conditions. In the late 1880s, Poincaré uncovered an inconsistency between Kirchhoff’s conditions and his solution, one that seemed to imply that waves should not exist at all. Researchers nevertheless continued to use Kirchhoff’s theory—even though Rayleigh, and much later Sommerfeld, developed a different and mathematically consistent formulation that, however, did not match experimental data better than Kirchhoff’s theory. After all, Kirchhoff’s formula worked quite well in a specific approximation regime. Finally, in 1964, Marchand and Wolf employed the transformation of Kirchhoff’s surface integral that had been developed by Maggi and Rubinowicz for other purposes. The result yielded a consistent boundary condition that, while introducing a species of discontinuity, nevertheless rescued the essential structure of Kirchhoff’s original formulation from Poincaré’s paradox.",Jed Z.

"," Considered herein are a number of variants of the classical Boussinesq system and their higher-order generalizations. Such equations were first derived by Boussinesq to describe the two-way propagation of small-amplitude, long wavelength, gravity waves on the surface of water in a canal. These systems arise also when modeling the propagation of long-crested waves on large lakes or the ocean and in other contexts. Depending on the modeling of dispersion, the resulting system may or may not have a linearization about the rest state which is well posed. Even when well posed, the linearized system may exhibit a lack of conservation of energy that is at odds with its status as an approximation to the Euler equations. In the present script, we derive a four-parameter family of Boussinesq systems from the two-dimensional Euler equations for free-surface flow and formulate criteria to help decide which of these equations one might choose in a given modeling situation. The analysis of the systems according to these criteria is initiated.

2128,A theory of biogenesis of lichen depsides and depsidones,Lichen depsides and depsidones are considered to arise from a common source (XIV) which originates from aldol condensation between a hexose and a biose and elimination of water. Oxidation and reduction lead to various modifications of this C8 unit and increase in the length of the sidechain arises from condensation with simple sugars and reduction. Depsides are formed by the combination of two of these units. β-Orcinol derivatives are obtained by nuclear methylation by means of formaldehyde and this reaction in general takes place prior to depside formation though the other possibility is not altogether excluded as far as the left half is concerned Depsidones come last in the evolution; they are based on depsides and require oxidation or dehydrogenation involving position 5 which is para to the activating hydroxyl. Nuclear oxidation without leading to depsidone formation also occurs. Either the 3-or the 5-position is involved and meta depsides result. Oxidation involving the left half is also possible and is represented by diploschistesic acid. The occurrence of orcinol and psoromic acid is attributed to decarboxylation taking place in the plant.,T. R.

2134,Improving Prediction Skill of Imperfect Turbulent Models Through Statistical Response and Information Theory,"Turbulent dynamical systems with a large phase space and a high degree of instabilities are ubiquitous in climate science and engineering applications. Statistical uncertainty quantification (UQ) to the response to the change in forcing or uncertain initial data in such complex turbulent systems requires the use of imperfect models due to the lack of both physical understanding and the overwhelming computational demands of Monte Carlo simulation with a large-dimensional phase space. Thus, the systematic development of reduced low-order imperfect statistical models for UQ in turbulent dynamical systems is a grand challenge. This paper applies a recent mathematical strategy for calibrating imperfect models in a training phase and accurately predicting the response by combining information theory and linear statistical response theory in a systematic fashion. A systematic hierarchy of simple statistical imperfect closure schemes for UQ for these problems is designed and tested which are built through new local and global statistical energy conservation principles combined with statistical equilibrium fidelity. The forty mode Lorenz 96 (L-96) model which mimics forced baroclinic turbulence is utilized as a test bed for the calibration and predicting phases for the hierarchy of computationally cheap imperfect closure models both in the full phase space and in a reduced three-dimensional subspace containing the most energetic modes. In all of phase spaces, the nonlinear response of the true model is captured accurately for the mean and variance by the systematic closure model, while alternative methods based on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem alone are much less accurate. For reduced-order model for UQ in the three-dimensional subspace for L-96, the systematic low-order imperfect closure models coupled with the training strategy provide the highest predictive skill over other existing methods for general forced response yet have simple design principles based on a statistical global energy equation. The systematic imperfect closure models and the calibration strategies for UQ for the L-96 model serve as a new template for similar strategies for UQ with model error in vastly more complex realistic turbulent dynamical systems.",Andrew J.

The size and the direction of the mean flow depend on the frequency of compression, the elasticity of the tubes, the compression ratio, and the type of compression with respect to time in a complicated manner. The system is modelled using a one-dimensional theory derived by averaging the Navier-Stokes equations ignoring higher order terms in a certain small quantity. The one-dimensional model is analysed partly analytically and partly numerically. A series of experiments on a physical realisation of the system are described. The theoretical findings and experimental results are compared; They show a remarkable agreement between the experiments and the predictions of the model.

2159,Modified barrier functions (theory and methods),"The nonlinear rescaling principle employs monotone and sufficiently smooth functions to transform the constraints and/or the objective function into an equivalent problem, the classical Lagrangian which has important properties on the primal and the dual spaces.The application of the nonlinear rescaling principle to constrained optimization problems leads to a class of modified barrier functions (MBF's) and MBF Methods (MBFM's). Being classical Lagrangians (CL's) for an equivalent problem, the MBF's combine the best properties of the CL's and classical barrier functions (CBF's) but at the same time are free of their most essential deficiencies.Due to the excellent MBF properties, new characteristics of the dual pair convex programming problems have been found and the duality theory for nonconvex constrained optimization has been developed.The MBFM have up to a superlinear rate of convergence and are to the classical barrier functions (CBF's) method as the Multipliers Method for Augmented Lagrangians is to the Classical Penalty Function Method. Based on the dual theory associated with MBF, the method for the simultaneous solution of the dual pair convex programming problems with up to quadratic rates of convergence have been developed. The application of the MBF to linear (LP) and quadratic (QP) programming leads to a new type of multipliers methods which have a much better rate of convergence under lower computational complexity at each step as compared to the CBF methods.The numerical realization of the MBFM leads to the Newton Modified Barrier Method (NMBM). The excellent MBF properties allow us to discover that for any nondegenerate constrained optimization problem, there exists a “hot” start, from which the NMBM has a better rate of convergence, a better complexity bound, and is more stable than the interior point methods, which are based on the classical barrier functions.",R.

The procedure of derivating a formal asymptotic expansion looks like the algorithm of asymptotic analysis in domains. Under the Dirichlet conditions (displacements are prescribed on the boundary of a domain), it is not hard to justify the power asymptotic series. It follows from the theorem on the unique solvability of the problem in spaces of the type L2 containing degrees of distance r=|x| as weight multipliers. For the Neumann conditions (stresses are prescribed on the boundary of a domain) an asymptotic expansion is justified by introducing the Eiry function Φ transforming the Lamé system to the biharmonic equation. Due to the appearance of the Dirichlet condition on Φ, the study of the asymptotic behavior of a solution to the last problem is simplified. The existence theorems and conditions for solvability of the “elastic” Neumann problem are presented. These results are based on the weighted Korn inequality. Bibliography: 29 titles.",S. A.

We show that such scrolls form an open dense subset of a component \({\mathcal H}\) of their Hilbert scheme; moreover, we study some properties of \({\mathcal H}\) (e.g. smoothness, dimensional computation, etc.) just in terms of \({\mathfrak F_g}\), the moduli space of such K3’s, and M

A condenser is understood as an ordered finite collection of sets each of which is marked with the sign + or − so that the closures of sets with opposite signs are mutually disjoint. The theory developed here is rich in content for arbitrary (not necessarily compact or closed) condensers. We obtain sufficient and (or) necessary conditions for the solvability of the main minimum problem of the theory of capacities of condensers and show that, under fairly general assumptions, these conditions form a criterion. For the main minimum problem (generally speaking, unsolvable even for a closed condenser), we pose and solve dual problems that are always solvable (even in the case of a nonclosed condenser). For all extremal problems indicated, we describe the potentials of minimal measures and investigate properties of extremals. As an auxiliary result, we solve the well-known problem of the existence of a condenser measure.

At the basis of the construction are certain maps with controlled Lipschitz constants between right-angled hyperbolic hexagons having three non-consecutive edges of the same size.

The surface energy effects are taken into account according to the surface elasticity theory of Gurtin and Murdoch. The developed geometrically nonlinear shell model is based on the classical Donnell shell theory and the von Kármán’s hypothesis. With the numerical results, the effect of the surface stress on the nonlinear buckling and postbuckling behaviors of nanoshells made of Si and Al is studied. Moreover, the influence of the surface residual tension and the radius-to-thickness ratio is illustrated.

2214,“The True” in Gottlob Frege's “Über die Grundlagen der Geometrie”,"In this essay, I examine the metaphysical and metalogical ramifications of Gottlob Frege's controversy with David Hilbert and Alwin Korselt, over Hilbert's
Grundlagen der Geometrie. These ramifications include(1) Korselt's original appeals to general metatheoretic Deutungen (interpretations);(2) Hilbert's puzzling belief that whatever is consistent in some sense ‘exists;’ and(3) Frege's ‘semantic monist’ conviction that theoretical sense and reference (mathematical and other) ‘must’ be “eindeutig lösbar” (“uniquely solvable”).My principal conclusions are(4) that Frege's position in (3) represented a pervasively dogmatic presumption that his newly discovered quantification theory ‘must’ have a propositional metatheory (‘the True’; ‘the False’); and(5) that this needless assumption adversely affected not only his polemic against the moderate semantic relativism of Hilbert and Korselt, but also his reception of type-theoretic ideas, and greatly facilitated his vulnerability to the sort of self-referential inconsistency Russell discovered in Grundgesetz V.These conclusions also seem to me to provide a conceptual framework for several of Frege's other arguments and reactions which might seem more particular and disparate. These include(6) his arbitrary restrictions on the range of second-order quantification, which undercut his own tentative attempts to give accounts of independence and semantic consequence;(7) his uncharacteristic hesitation, even dismay, at the prospect that such accounts might eventuate in a genuinely quantificational metamathematics, whose Gegenstände (objects) might themselves be Gedanken (thoughts); and, perhaps most revealingly(8) his otherwise quite enigmatic, quasi-stoic doctrine that ‘genuine’ formal deduction ‘must’ be from premises that are ‘true.’A deep reluctance to pluralize or iterate ‘the’ transition from theory to meta-theory would also be consonant, of course, with Frege's vigorous insistence that there can be only one level each of linguistic Begriffe (concepts) and Gegenstände (objects). With hindsight, such an assumption may seem more gratuitous in the philosophy of language (where it contributed, I would argue, to Wittgenstein's famous transition to ‘the mystical’ in 6.45 and 6.522 of the Tractatus); but its more implausible implications in this wider context seemed to emerge more slowly.In the mathematical test-case discussed here, however, such strains were immediately and painfully apparent; the first models of hyperbolic geometry were described some thirty years before Frege drafted his polemic against Hilbert's pioneering exposition. It is my hope that a careful study of Frege's lines of argument in this relatively straightforward mathematical controversy may suggest other, parallel approaches to the richer and more ambiguous problems of his philosophy of language.",William Boos,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,1985,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00329904,"Conceptual Framework,Quantification Theory,Careful Study,Undercut,Semantic Relativism"
2215, Denotational semantics for intuitionistic type theory using a hierarchy of domains with totality," A modified version of Normann's hierarchy of domains with totality [9] is presented and is shown to be suitable for interpretation of Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory. This gives an interpretation within classical set theory, which is natural in the sense that \(\Sigma\)-types are interpreted as sets of pairs and \(\Pi\)-types as sets of choice functions. The hierarchy admits a natural definition of the total objects in the domains, and following an idea of Berger [3] this makes possible an interpretation where a type is defined to be true if its interpretation contains a total object. In particular, the empty type contains no total objects and will therefore be false (in any non-empty context). In addition, there is a natural equivalence relation on the total objects, so we derive a hierarchy of topological spaces (quotient spaces wrt. the Scott topology), and give a second interpretation using this hierarchy.",Geir Waagbø,Archive for Mathematical Logic,1999,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001530050114,"Equivalence Relation,Topological Space,Choice Function,Type Theory,Quotient Space"

After extending the associated moduli problems over ℤ we obtain an arithmetic threefold with a embedded arithmetic surface, which we view as a cycle of codimension one. We then construct a family, indexed by totally positive algebraic integers in the real quadratic field, of codimension two cycles (complex multiplication points) on the arithmetic threefold. The intersection multiplicities of the codimension two cycles with the fixed codimension one cycle are shown to agree with the Fourier coefficients of a (very particular) Hilbert modular form of weight 3/2.

2228,A computational framework for connection matrix theory,"The connection matrix is a powerful algebraic topological tool from Conley index theory, a subfield of topological dynamics. Conley index theory is a purely topological generalization of Morse theory in which the connection matrix subsumes the role of the Morse boundary operator. Over the last few decades, Conley’s approach to dynamics has been cast into a purely computational form. In this paper we introduce a computational and categorical framework for connection matrix theory. Broadly speaking, this contribution promotes the computational Conley theory to a computational, homological theory for dynamical systems. More specifically, within this paper we have three specific aims: 

1.
We cast connection matrix theory in an appropriate categorical, homotopy-theoretic language. We demonstrate the relationship to the previous definitions of connection matrix. Lastly, the homotopy-theoretic language allows us to formulate connection matrix theory categorically.


2.
We describe an algorithm for the computation of connection matrices based on algebraic-discrete Morse theory and formalized with the notion of reductions. We advertise an open-source implementation of our algorithm.


3.
We show that the connection matrix can be used to compute persistent homology. Ultimately, we believe that connection matrix theory has the potential to be an important tool within topological data analysis.

2230,The basic theory of partial α-recursive operators,"
In this paper, we investigate the theory of partial α-recursive operators and functionals, α an admissible ordinal, which are defined in terms of α-enumeration reducibility. The theory bifurcates into the study of weak operators and functionate, and of operators and functionate proper. The status of the representative theorems of the classical theory (when α=ω) is examined relative to both kinds of operators and functionals. Especial attention is given to the difficulties, when such exist, encountered in generalizing a classical result, whether simple or profound, to level α. In the course of the investigation we are led to consider briefly topics such as the structure theory of completely recursively enumerable classes of α-recursively enumerable sets. This is natural since this theory bears on the properties of effective operations at level α. The paper provides the framework for the further investigation of this and allied topics.",Robert A.

Laplace's theory of probability is subdivided into theory of probability proper, limit theorems and mathematical statistics (not yet distinguished as a separate entity). I maintain that in its very design Laplace's theory of probability is a discipline pertaining to natural science rather than to mathematics. I maintain also the idea that the so-called Laplacian determinism was no hindrance to applications of his theory of probability to natural science and that one of his utterances in this connection could have well been made by Maxwell's contemporaries.Two possible reasons why the theory of probability stagnated after Laplace's work are singled out: the absence of new fields of application and, also, the insufficient level of mathematical abstraction used by Laplace. For all his achievements, I reach the general conclusion that he did not originate the theory of probability as it is now known.",O. B.

We show that its mod 2 evaluation is given by
the triple cup product in cohomology, and so it coincides with a

Our counting argument makes use of a natural action of

construct perturbations that are equivariant with respect to this action.

Thus, we introduce and study the structure of a totally-ordered multiple knapsack set. The valid multi-cover inequalities we derive for its convex hull have a number of interesting properties. First, they generalize the well-known (1, k)-configuration inequalities. Second, they are not aggregation cuts. Third, they cannot be generated as rank-1 Chvátal-Gomory cuts from the inequality system consisting of the knapsack constraints and all their minimal cover inequalities. We also provide conditions under which the inequalities are facets for the convex hull of the totally-ordered knapsack set, as well as conditions for those inequalities to fully characterize its convex hull.

Here the effects of feedback of the variance on the steady states and adiabatic dynamics of neural systems are calculated using linear neural field theory to estimate the neural voltage variance, then including this quantity in the total variance parameter of the nonlinear firing rate-voltage response function, and thus into determination of the fixed points and the variance itself. The general results further clarify the limits of validity of approaches with and without inclusion of variance dynamics. Specific applications show that stability against a saddle-node bifurcation is reduced in a purely cortical system, but can be either increased or decreased in the corticothalamic case, depending on the initial state. Estimates of critical variance scalings near saddle-node bifurcation are also found, including physiologically based normalizations and new scalings for mean firing rate and the position of the bifurcation.","P.

The trace field theory topologically describes the modified trace, the Hattori-Stallings trace, and also the structures induced by them on the Hochschild complex of \(\mathcal {C}\). In this article, we focus on implications in the linear (as opposed to differential graded) setting: We use the trace field theory to define a non-unital homotopy commutative product on the Hochschild chains in degree zero.

2261,Sequential conjugate-gradient-restoration algorithm for optimal control problems. Part 1. Theory,"This paper considers the problem of minimizing a functionalI which depends on the statex(t), the controlu(t), and the parameter π. Here,I is a scalar,x ann-vector,u anm-vector, and π ap-vector. At the initial point, the state is prescribed. At the final point, the state and the parameter are required to satisfyq scalar relations. Along the interval of integration, the state, the control, and the parameter are required to satisfyn scalar differential equations.First, the case of a quadratic functional subject to linear constraints is considered, and a conjugate-gradient algorithm is derived. Nominal functionsx(t),u(t), π satisfying all the differential equations and boundary conditions are assumed. Variations Δx(t), δu(t), Δπ are determined so that the value of the functional is decreased. These variations are obtained by minimizing the first-order change of the functional subject to the differential equations, the boundary conditions, and a quadratic constraint on the variations of the control and the parameter.Next, the more general case of a nonquadratic functional subject to nonlinear constraints is considered. The algorithm derived for the linear-quadratic case is employed with one modification: a restoration phase is inserted between any two successive conjugate-gradient phases.In the restoration phase, variations Δx(t), Δu(t), Δπ are determined by requiring the least-square change of the control and the parameter subject to the linearized differential equations and the linearized boundary conditions. Thus, a sequential conjugate-gradient-restoration algorithm is constructed in such a way that the differential equations and the boundary conditions are satisfied at the end of each complete conjugate-gradient-restoration cycle.Several numerical examples illustrating the theory of this paper are given in Part 2 (see Ref. 1).

A transition in cellular metabolism, i.e., the dynamical evolution from an initial locally stable steady-state solution for the concentration distributions to another distinct locally stable steady-state solution, can be induced by an etiologic agent which modifies the rate expressions significantly during an interval of time. Global inequality analysis is employed to derive a condition on the modified rate expressions that is sufficient to guarantee the occurrence of such a transition in cellular metabolism. The possibility of a transition induced by a chemical carcinogen is investigated by applying the latter sufficient condition, and it is found that the statistical frequency of carcinogenesis should depend essentially on the magnitude of the grouping (T
2 − α
D
α) for a total doseD of carcinogen administered to an animal at a uniform rate (D/T) over a time interval of durationT, where α is a certain positive number less than 1.

2267,On the theory of motion of nonholonomic systems. The reducing-multiplier theorem,"This classical paper by S.A. Chaplygin presents a part of his research in non-holonomic mechanics. In this paper, Chaplygin suggests a general method for integration of the equations of motion for non-holonomic systems, which he himself called the “reducing-multiplier method”. The method is illustrated on two concrete problems from non-holonomic mechanics. This paper produced a considerable effect on the further development of the Russian non-holonomic community. With the help of Chaplygin’s reducing-multiplier theory the equations for quite a number of non-holonomic systems were solved (such systems are known as Chaplygin systems). First published about a hundred years ago, this work has not lost its scientific significance and is hoped to be estimated at its true worth by the English-speaking world.This publication contributes to the series of RCD translations of Chaplygin’s scientific heritage. In 2002 we published two of his works (both cited in this one) in the special issue dedicated to non-holonomic mechanics (RCD, Vol. 7, no. 2). These translations along with translations of his other two papers on hydrodynamics (RCD, Vol. 12, nos. 1,2) aroused considerable interest and are broadly cited by modern researches.",S. A.

2274,Classification of finite rings: Theory and algorithm,"An interesting topic in the ring theory is the classification of finite rings. Although rings of certain orders have already been classified, a full description of all rings of a given order remains unknown. The purpose of this paper is to classify all finite rings (up to isomorphism) of a given order. In doing so, we introduce a new concept of quasi basis for certain type of modules, which is a useful computational tool for dealing with finite rings. Then, using this concept, we give structure and isomorphism theorems for finite rings and state our main result to classify (up to isomorphism) the finite rings of a given order. Finally, based on these results, we describe an algorithm to calculate the structure of all such rings. We have implemented our new algorithm in Maple, and we apply it to an example.","Mahmood Behboodi1,2, Reza Beyranvand3, Amir Hashemi1,2 & …Hossein Khabazian",Czechoslovak Mathematical Journal,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10587-014-0124-7,"classification of finite ring,finite abelian group,quasi base"

We also provide an algorithm that constructs a discrete stratified Morse function out of an arbitrary function defined on a finite simplicial complex; this is different from simply constructing a discrete Morse function on such a complex. We then give simple examples to convey the utility of our theory.

In particular, for an arbitrary consistent kernel in a locally compact space, we prove a theorem on the strong completeness of fairly general subspaces E of all measures with finite energy. (Note that, according to the well-known Cartan counterexample, the entire space E is strongly incomplete even in the classical case of the Newton kernel in ℝn Using this theorem, we obtain new results for the Gauss variational problem, namely, in the non-compact case, we give a description of vague and (or) strong limiting measures of minimizing sequences and obtain sufficient solvability conditions.",N.

2282,Variables separated equations: Strikingly different roles for the Branch Cycle Lemma and the finite simple group classification,"Davenport’s Problem asks: What can we expect of two polynomials, over Z, with the same ranges on almost all residue class fields? This stood out among many separated variable problems posed by Davenport, Lewis and Schinzel.By bounding the degrees, but expanding the maps and variables in Davenport’s Problem, Galois stratification enhanced the separated variable theme, solving an Ax and Kochen problem from their Artin Conjecture work. Denef and Loeser applied this to add Chow motive coefficients to previously introduced zeta functions on a diophantine statement.By restricting the variables, but leaving the degrees unbounded, we found the striking distinction between Davenport’s problem over Q, solved by applying the Branch Cycle Lemma, and its generalization over any number field, solved by using the simple group classification. This encouraged Thompson to formulate the genus 0 problem on rational function monodromy groups. Guralnick and Thompson led its solution in stages. We look at two developments since the solution of Davenport’s problem.

First the appropiate dense subspace of the domain space of the integral is obtained through a more sound and simple technique, after establishing a preliminary result of topology. Secondly non Hausdorff spaces are handled from an entirely topological point of view, which is the only rigorous and clearly motivated one, and in fact allows to get rid of all the confusion and the errors that the shaky measure theoretic “a.e.” generates. Finally the constraints on the specification of the underlying measure spaces, that our method reveals to be necessary for a correct definition of the integral, require to be met a result of measure theory, which is also established.

In particular, Tycho Brahe adapted most of his instruments to solar observations, both of positions and of apparent diameters, by fitting the upper pinnule of his diopters with an aperture and allowing the lower pinnule with an engraved centering circle to serve as a screen. In conjunction with these innovations a method of calculating apparent solar diameters on the basis of the measured size of the image was developed, but the method was almost entirely empirically based and developed without the assistance of an adequate theory of the formation of images behind small apertures. Thus resulted the unsuccessful extension of the method by Tycho to the quantitative observation of apparent lunar diameters during solar eclipses. Kepler's attention to the eclipse of July 1600, prompted by Tycho's anomalous results, gave him occasion to consider the relevant theory of measurement. The result was a fully articulated account of pinhole images.",Stephen Straker,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,1981,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00357311,"16th Century,Measured Size,Solar Eclipse,Adequate Theory,Small Aperture"

2298,"Techniques, computations, and conjectures for semi-topological K-theory","We establish the existence of an “Atiyah-Hirzebruch-like” spectral sequence relating the morphic cohomology groups of a smooth, quasi-projective complex variety to its semi-topological K-groups. This spectral sequence is compatible with (and, indeed, is built from) the motivic spectral sequence that relates the motivic cohomology and algebraic K-theory of varieties, and it is also compatible with the classical Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence in algebraic topology. In the second part of this paper, we use this spectral sequence in conjunction with another computational tool that we introduce — namely, a variation on the integral weight filtration of the Borel-Moore (singular) homology of complex varieties introduced by H. Gillet and C. Soulé – to compute the semi-topological K-theory of a large class of varieties. In particular, we prove that for curves, surfaces, toric varieties, projective rational three-folds, and related varieties, the semi-topological K-groups and topological K-groups are isomorphic in all degrees permitted by cohomological considerations. We also formulate integral conjectures relating semi-topological K-theory to topological K-theory analogous to more familiar conjectures (namely, the Quillen-Lichtenbaum and Beilinson-Lichtenbaum Conjectures) concerning mod-n algebraic K-theory and motivic cohomology. In particular, we prove a local vanishing result for morphic cohomology which enables us to formulate precisely a conjectural identification of morphic cohomology by A. Suslin. Our computations verify that these conjectures hold for the list of varieties above.","Eric M. Friedlander1, Christian Haesemeyer2 & Mark E.

Assuming stationary environments, the ergodic theory of Markov processes is applied to give conditions for the existence of finite invariant measure (equilibrium distributions) and to obtain ergodic theorems, which provide results on convergence of products of random stochastic matrices. Coupling theory is used to obtain results on direct convergence of these products and the structure of the tail σ-field. State properties including classification and communication properties are discussed.",Robert Cogburn,Zeitschrift für Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Verwandte Gebiete,1984,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00532799,"Markov Chain,Markov Process,Invariant Measure,Ergodic Theorem,Random Environment"
2300,The theory of \({\vec Z}C(2)^2\)-lattices is decidable," For arbitrary finite group \(G\) and countable Dedekind domain \(R\) such that the residue field \(R/P\) is finite for every maximal \(R\)-ideal \(P\), we show that the localizations at every maximal ideal of two \(RG\)-lattices are isomorphic if and only if the two lattices satisfy the same first order sentences. Then we investigate generalizations of the above results to arbitrary \(R\)-torsion-free \(RG\)-modules and we apply the previous results to show the decidability of the theory of \({\vec Z}C(2)^2\)-lattices. Eventually, we show that \({\vec Z} [i] C(2)^2\)-lattices have undecidable theory.

The time dependence of the metric represents the evolution of the stress-free (natural) configuration of the body in response to changes in mass density and “shape”. We show that the time dependency of the material metric will affect the energy balance and the entropy production inequality; both the energy balance and the entropy production inequality have to be modified. We then obtain the governing equations covariantly by postulating invariance of energy balance under time-dependent spatial diffeomorphisms. We use the principle of maximum entropy production in deriving an evolution equation for the material metric. In the case of isotropic growth, we find those growth distributions that do not result in residual stresses. We then look at Lagrangian field theory of growing elastic solids. We will use the Lagrange–d’Alembert principle with Rayleigh’s dissipation functions to derive the governing equations. We make an explicit connection between our geometric theory and the conventional multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, F=F

We show that the support of all \( \Gamma \)-invariant conformal densities of dimension \( \delta(\Gamma) \) on \( X_{reg} (\infty) \) (e.g. Patterson-Sullivan densities) lie in a same and single regular G-orbit on \( X(\infty) \). This provides information on the large-scale growth of \( \Gamma \)-orbits in X. If in addition we assume \( \Gamma \) to be of divergence type, then there is a unique density of the previous type. Furthermore, we explicitly determine \( \delta(\Gamma) \) and this G-orbit for lattices, and show that they are of divergence type.

2322,The theory of elasticity and of wave-propagation in crystals from the atomistic standpoint,"The static method of obtaining the strain energy function of a crystal has been developed for the case where the potential energy of the entire lattice is a general quadratic in the nuclear displacements of the atoms of the crystal. It is shown that for heterogeneous strains, the deformation energy of the crystal is a quadratic in all the nine strain components. For small homogeneous deformations, the strain energy function reduces to the form of the corresponding function in the elasticity theory. The wave equations obtained from this energy function by the variational procedure are identical with the wave equations of the elasticity theory. By comparing either the two forms of the strain energy function or the two sets of waveequations, expressions for the elastic constants can be obtained in terms of the atomic force constants.Starting from the most general expression for the strain energy function which is a quadratic in all the nine strain components and by assuming that the strain components are all linearly independent functions of the position vector of any point of the solid, the wave equations of Begbie and Born have been derived by means of Hamilton’s variational principle. But these equations are not reducible to the symmetric form of the wave equations of the elasticity theory without further assumption of additional relations among the force constants. Since there is no justification for such new relations which restrict the generality of the force scheme used, the expressions of Begbie-Born and of Kun Huang for the elastic constants of crystals are not valid in a general force scheme. The expressions for the elastic constants which follow the different theoretical procedures are derived for the case of diamond and are compared with the experimental results.Finally, a cubic equation whose roots determine the limiting group velocities of the long acoustic waves travelling in any direction of the crystal, has been derived; this replaces the expression for the velocities of the long acoustic waves given in an earlier paper by the author.",K.

To be precise, the authors consider the infinitely repeated games between a human and a machine based on the generic 2×2 game with fixed machine strategy of finite k-step memory. By introducing and analyzing the state transfer graphes (STG), it will be shown that the system state will become periodic after finite steps under the optimal strategy that maximizes the human’s averaged payoff, which helps us to ease the task of finding the optimal strategy considerably. Moreover, the question whether the optimizer will win or lose is investigated and some interesting phenomena are found, e.g., for the standard Prisoner’s Dilemma game, the human will not lose to the machine while optimizing her own averaged payoff when k = 1; however, when k ≥ 2, she may indeed lose if she focuses on optimizing her own payoff only. The robustness of the optimal strategy and identification problem are also considered.

More specifically, with \(\bar{X}_t:= \sup _{0\le s\le t} X_s\) denoting the running maximum of the Lévy process \(X_t\), the aim is to evaluate \(\mathbb{P }(\bar{X}_t \in \mathrm{d}x)\) for \(t,x>0\). The starting point is the Wiener–Hopf factorization, which yields an expression for the transform \(\mathbb E e^{-\alpha \bar{X}_{e(\vartheta )}}\) of the running maximum at an exponential epoch (with \(\vartheta ^{-1}\) the mean of this exponential random variable). This expression is first rewritten in a more convenient form, and then it is pointed out how to use Laplace inversion techniques to numerically evaluate \(\mathbb{P }(\bar{X}_t\in \mathrm{d}x).\) In our experiments we rely on the efficient and accurate algorithm developed in den Iseger (Probab Eng Inf Sci 20:1–44, 2006). We illustrate the performance of the algorithm with various examples: Brownian motion (with drift), a compound Poisson process, and a jump diffusion process. In models with jumps, we are also able to compute the density of the first time a specific threshold is exceeded, jointly with the corresponding overshoot.

2334,Verification Theory and Approximate Optimal Harvesting Strategy for a Stochastic Competitive Ecosystem Subject to Lévy Noise,"This work focuses on optimal harvesting problems for a stochastic competitive ecosystem subject to Lévy noise. A verification theorem for corresponding harvesting strategy is established, which offers sufficient conditions for deriving an optimal harvesting strategy and an upper bound of the value function. For a given instantaneous marginal yields function, a concrete upper bound of value function is constructed by applying the verification theorem obtained in this paper. Meanwhile, the monotonicity of value function is investigated. Also, an ε-optimal harvesting strategy is designed to find an approximate optimal harvesting strategy for those harvesting problems with no exact optimal harvesting strategy. Finally, by choosing appropriately Markov decision process defined on a discrete state space, a computational method for an optimal harvesting strategy is designed and a concrete example is also given to show the implementation of the algorithm.","Huili Xiang1,2, Bin Liu1 & Zuxiong Li1,",Journal of Dynamical and Control Systems,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10883-017-9362-y,"Competitive ecosystem,Lévy noise,Optimal harvesting strategy,Computational method"

2338,Extending Transition Path Theory: Periodically Driven and Finite-Time Dynamics,"Given two distinct subsets A, B in the state space of some dynamical system, transition path theory (TPT) was successfully used to describe the statistical behavior of transitions from A to B in the ergodic limit of the stationary system. We derive generalizations of TPT that remove the requirements of stationarity and of the ergodic limit and provide this powerful tool for the analysis of other dynamical scenarios: periodically forced dynamics and time-dependent finite-time systems. This is partially motivated by studying applications such as climate, ocean, and social dynamics. On simple model examples, we show how the new tools are able to deliver quantitative understanding about the statistical behavior of such systems. We also point out explicit cases where the more general dynamical regimes show different behaviors to their stationary counterparts, linking these tools directly to bifurcations in non-deterministic systems.

A method is proposed for bunching the grid when solving these problems numerically by a variational-difference method.

2344,"Harmonic Measure, Equilibrium Measure, and Thinness at Infinity in the Theory of Riesz Potentials","The paper deals with the theory of potentials with respect to the α-Riesz kernel |x − y|α−n of order α ∈ (0,2] on \(\mathbb R^{n}\), \(n\geqslant 3\). Focusing first on the inner α-harmonic measure \({\varepsilon _{y}^{A}}\) (εy being the unit Dirac measure at \(y\in \mathbb R^{n}\), and μA the inner α-Riesz balayage of a Radon measure μ to \(A\subset \mathbb R^{n}\) arbitrary), we describe its Euclidean support, provide a formula for evaluation of its total mass, establish the vague continuity of the map \(y{\mapsto \varepsilon _{y}^{A}}\) outside the inner α-irregular points for A, and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for \({\varepsilon _{y}^{A}}\) to be of finite energy (more generally, for \({\varepsilon _{y}^{A}}\) to be absolutely continuous with respect to inner capacity) as well as for \({\varepsilon _{y}^{A}}(\mathbb R^{n})\equiv 1\) to hold. Those criteria are given in terms of newly defined concepts of inner α-thinness and inner α-ultrathinness of A at infinity that for α = 2 and A Borel coincide with the concepts of outer 2-thinness at infinity by Doob and Brelot, respectively. Further, we extend some of these results to μA general by verifying the integral representation formula \(\mu ^{A}={\int \limits \varepsilon _{y}^{A}} d\mu (y)\). We also show that for every \(A\subset \mathbb R^{n}\), there exists a Kσ-set A0 ⊂ A such that \(\mu ^A=\mu ^{A_0}\) for all μ, and give various applications of this theorem. In particular, we prove the vague and strong continuity of the inner swept, resp. inner equilibrium, measure under an approximation of A arbitrary, thereby strengthening Fuglede’s result established for A Borel (Acta Math., 1960). Being new even for α = 2, the results obtained also present a further development of the theory of inner Newtonian capacities and of inner Newtonian balayage, originated by Cartan.","Natalia Zorii

Motivated by results of Alekhno (Positivity 11:375–386, 2007, Positivity 13:3–20, 2009), the definitions of upper Weyl and upper Browder elements in an ordered Banach algebra (OBA) were given in Benjamin and Mouton (Quaest Math 39:643–664, 2016), thereby initiating the study of the interplay between Fredholm theory and ordering. Inspired by an indication that these elements could be useful in the context of OBAs, certain variants of the invertible, Fredholm, Weyl and Browder elements (namely the r-invertible, r-Fredholm, r-Weyl and r-Browder elements) were investigated in Benjamin et al. (Glasgow Math J, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0017089518000393) in the context of general Banach algebras. Continuing the development of Fredholm theory in ordered Banach algebras, we now introduce the notions of upper r-Weyl, contractive upper r-Weyl, upper r-Browder and contractive upper r-Browder elements in an OBA and, motivated by previous results, investigate conditions under which the positive almost r-invertible r-Fredholm elements will be contractive upper r-Browder. This also leads to the recovering (and strengthening) of certain results in Benjamin and Mouton (Positivity 21:575–592, 2017) regarding the upper Browder spectrum property.","Ronalda Benjamin1 & Sonja Mouton

As concave programming is the best studied class of problems in global optimization, several concave programs such as simplicial and conical partitioning algorithms can be used for the resolution. Moreover, these global techniques can be combined with a local Frank and Wolfe feasible direction algorithm and improved by the use of specialized stopping criteria, hence reducing the overall computational overhead. In this respect, the proposed hybrid optimization scheme can be considered as a new line of attack for solving hard control problems.Computational experiments indicate the viability of our algorithms, and that in the worst case they require the solution of a few LMI programs. Power and efficiency of the algorithms are demonstrated for a realistic inverted-pendulum control problem.Overall, this dedication reflects the key role that concavity and LMIs play in difficult control problems.",Pierre Apkarian1 & Hoang Duong Tuan,Journal of Global Optimization,1999,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1008385006172,"Fixed-order control,H∞ synthesis,Robust control,Parametric uncertainty,Linear matrix inequalities,Global concave minimization,Frank and Wolfe algorithms"

The term anisotropic is understood in the sense that the growth of P(ξ) as ξ→∞ and the decrease of v(x) as x→∞ can depend essentially on the direction of the vectors ξ and x respectively. This permits us to include in the sphere of applications of the abstract scattering theory of a nonelliptic unperturbed operator the D'Alembert operator, an ultrahyperbolic operator, nonstationary Schrödinger operator, etc. In view of the anisotropic character of the assumptions on the potential, the results obtained are new even in the elliptic case.

This setting is a natural generalization of the classical problem of interpolation of the boundedness property for a linear operator that is bounded between two Banach couples. We introduce the general concept of a Banach triple of cones possessing the interpolation property with respect to a given Banach triple. We provide sufficient conditions under which a triple of cones (Q0,Q1,Q) in weighted spaces of numerical sequences possesses the interpolation property with respect to a given Banach triple of weighted spaces of numerical sequences (F0, F1, F). Appropriate interpolation theorems generalize the classical result about interpolation of linear operators in weighted spaces and are of interest for the theory of bases in Fréchet spaces.

This result does not say anything about the zero distribution of f in each individual logarithmic strip. Here, it is shown that the asymptotic growth of the non-integrated counting function of zeros of f is asymptotically comparable to \(r^q\) in each logarithmic strip. The result generalizes the first order results by Pólya and Schwengeler from the 1920’s, and it shows, among other things, that the critical rays of f are precisely the Borel directions of order q of f. The error terms in the asymptotic equations for T(r, f) and N(r, 1/f) originally due to Steinmetz are also improved.","Janne M.

2374," The \({\cal {D Q R}}\) algorithm, basic theory, convergence, and conditional stability"," We describe a fast matrix eigenvalue algorithm that uses a matrix factorization and reverse order multiply technique involving three factors  and that is based on the symmetric matrix factorization as well as on \(D\)–orthogonal reduction techniques where \(D= \mbox{ diag}(\pm1)\) is computed from the given matrix \(A\). It operates on a similarity reduction of a real matrix \(A_{nn}\) to general tridiagonal form \(T\) and computes all of \(A\)'s eigenvalues in \(\frac{4}{3} n^3 + O(n^2)\) operations, where the \(O(n^2)\) part of the operations is possibly performed over \({\Bbb C}\), instead of the 7–8 \(n^3\) real flops required by the \(QR\) eigenvalue algorithm. Potential breakdo wn of the \(DQR\) algorithm can occur in the reduction to tridiagonal form and in the \(D\)–orthogonal \(DQR\) reductions. Both, however, can be monitored during the computations. The former  occurs rather rarely for dimensions \(n \leq 300\) and can essentially be bypassed, while the latter is extremely rare and can be bypassed as well in our conditionally stable implementation of the \(DQR\) steps. We prove an implicit \(DQ\) theorem which allows implicit shifts, give a convergence proof for the \(DQR\) algorithm and show that \(DQR\) is conditionally stable for general balanced tridiagonal matrices \(T_{\rm b}\).

We say that a tensor T belonging to a differential-geometric object of order s of a three-web W is closed if it can be expressed in terms of components of objects of lower order s. We find all closed tensors of a three-web and the geometric sense of one of relations connecting three-web tensors. We also point out some sufficient conditions for the web to have a closed G-structure. It follows from our results that the G-structure associated with a hexagonal three-web W is a closed G-structure of class 4. It is proved that basic tensors of a three-web W belonging to a differential-geometric object of order s of the web can be expressed in terms of an s-jet of the canonical expansion of its coordinate loop, and conversely. This implies that the canonical expansion of every coordinate loop of a three-web W with closed G-structure of class s is completely defined by an s-jet of this expansion.

Analysis of the model with techniques of optimal control theory suggests that fecundity is maximized either by allocating food resources to reproduction for the entire time period prior to egg laying, or by growing first, then switching to reproduction later in the year. The analysis also indicates that egg mortality will be minimized if the female provides maternal care at the maximum level throughout egg brooding. These results are not specific to dusky salamanders, but can be extended to other organisms with similar reproductive characteristics.",Carole L.

2385,Globalized robust Markov perfect equilibrium for discounted stochastic games and its application on intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks: Part I—theory,"In this article, we study a discounted stochastic game to model resource optimal intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. To address the problem of uncertainties in various network parameters, we propose a globalized robust game-theoretic framework for discounted robust stochastic games. A robust solution to the considered problem is an optimal point that is feasible for all realizations of data from a given uncertainty set. To allow a controlled violation of the constraints when the parameters move out of the uncertainty set, the concept of globalized robust framework comes into view. In this article, we formulate a globalized robust counterpart for the discounted stochastic game under consideration. With the help of globalized robust optimization, a concept of globalized robust Markov perfect equilibrium is introduced. The existence of such an equilibrium is shown for a discounted stochastic game when the number of actions of the players is finite. The contraction mapping theorem, Kakutani fixed point theorem and the concept of equicontinuity are used to prove the existence result. To compute a globalized robust Markov perfect equilibrium for the considered discounted stochastic game, a tractable representation of the proposed globalized robust counterpart is also provided. Using the derived tractable representation, we formulate a globalized robust intrusion detection system for wireless sensor networks.","Debdas Ghosh

Each disc has analytic structure, and each element \({F\in \mathcal{T}_{+}(E) }\) gives rise to an operator-valued function \({\widehat{F}_{\sigma}}\) on \({\overline{D(E,\sigma)}}\) that is continuous and analytic on the interior.

While the statements of many of the results in the weighted theory are anticipated by those in the unweighted setting, substantially different proofs are required. Interesting new connections with the theory of completely positive maps are developed. Our perspective has been inspired by work of Vladimir Müller (J Oper Theory 20(1):3–20, 1988) in which he studied operators that can be modeled by parts of weighted shifts. Our results may be interpreted as providing a description of operator algebras that can be modeled by weighted tensor algebras. Our results also extend work of Gelu Popescu (Mem Am Math Soc 200(941):vi+91, 2009), who investigated similar questions.",Paul S.

The formula for the intensity of the resultant beam is obtained from the interference formula for coherent beams by multiplying the third interference term by the degree of coherence γ (defined statistically). The states of the two given polarised beams and that of the resultant incompletely polarised beam may be characterised by respective vectors drawn from the centre of the Poincaré sphere : the length of each vector and its orientation (i.e., point of intersection with the sphere) may be regarded as giving respectively the intensity and state of polarisation, of the polarised fraction of the corresponding beam. The vector for the resultant beam is obtained by adding to the sum of the two given vectors (which are directed towards points A and B), a third vector directed towards a point C″ on the Poincaré sphere. This last vector which arises because of the interference of the beams, is specified in terms of the angles of the triangle ABC″, which is isoscles: the base angles A and B are both equal to the effective phase difference δ and the length of the vector is equal to\(2\gamma \sqrt {I_1 I_2 } \sin \raise.5ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle 1$}\kern-.1em/ \kern-.15em\lower.25ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle 2$} \hat C''\).The converse problem is discussed and also the addition ofn partially oherent polarised beams.

2414,Daphnicle dynamics based on kinetic theory: An analogue-modelling of swarming and behaviour of Daphnia,"Attempts are presented of an analogue modelling of Daphnia responses to various influences and stimuli, as distribution of food and of predators. An aim of the study is to examine to what extent a statistical-mechanical approach may be useful as a tool in modelling of Daphnia swarms behaviour. In the modelling we follow a line close to test particle studies in physical sciences. A generalized kinetic equation of what we shall call daphnicles is derived. The modelling incorporates individual characteristics of daphnicles, as position, velocity, degree of food saturation and responses daphnicles have to outside influences. Each daphnicle we assume responds to some stimuli in ordered ways and to others in stochastic ways, and the degree or strength of reactions depends on the density of all daphnicles, the density of food available, the saturation level of daphnicles and the threat level in the environment, or background, the daphnicles are living on. Some fluid equations of daphnicle swarms are subsequently derived from the basic equation, and solutions are given of the model-equations, including a food distribution equation, in some particular cases that show peculiarities in reactions of daphnicles to food, degree of saturation and to threat, when these are acting alone, and in combination. The modelling results may be compared to results of laboratory experiments of Daphnia behaviour that soon will be performed.",Alf H.

Sacher and E. Trucco (“The Stochastic Theory of Mortality.”Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.,96, 985–1007, cited here as ST). We assume that the reader is familiar with ST, where the stochastic theory of mortality, originally proposed by Sacher, is discussed at length. We recall that the basic model presented there refers to an ensemble of particles performing Brownian motion in one dimension, with the added constraint of two absorbing barriers. These two points, collectively, are designated as the “lethal bound.” Part I (section 1 to 4) deals with the special case in which the two absorbing barriers are symmetrically located at a finite distance from the origin. The solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is obtained from the theory of eigenvalue problems. Quite generally, the eigenfunctions functions belong to the family of Kummer's confluent hypergeometric functions, but the symmetry condition imposed here results in considerable simplification and makes it possible to estimate the first few eigenvalues by a graphical procedure. In section 3 we show how perturbation theory can be applied in the limiting case of “weak homeostasis,” and section 4 deals with the opposite extreme of “strong homeostasis.” A rigorous proof is given for the result corresponding to equation (28) of ST (asymptotic or quasi-static approximation for the “force of mortality”).",Ernesto Trucco,The bulletin of mathematical biophysics,1963,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02484025,"Hermite Polynomial,Stochastic Theory,Opposite Extreme,Finite Distance,Confluent Hypergeometric Function"

The upper part of the spectrum with a wavelength comparable to the internal characteristic dimension of the nanorod is investigated. An integral-form equation with a Helmholtz kernel, containing both local and nonlocal phases, is used as the constitutive one. The original integrodifferential equation is reduced to a fourth-order differential equation with variable coefficients and a pair of additional boundary-value conditions is obtained. Using the WKB-method, we construct a solution of the boundary-value problem in the form of the superposition of a main solution and edge-effect integrals.

This paper aims to bring graph coloring and uncertainty theory together. A new approach for uncertain graph coloring based on an \(\alpha \)-cut of an uncertain graph is introduced in this paper. Firstly, the concept of \(\alpha \)-cut of uncertain graph is given and some of its properties are explored. By means of \(\alpha \)-cut coloring, we get an \(\alpha \)-cut chromatic number and examine some of its properties as well. Then, a fact that every \(\alpha \)-cut chromatic number may be a chromatic number of an uncertain graph is obtained, and the concept of uncertain chromatic set is introduced. In addition, an uncertain chromatic algorithm is constructed. Finally, a real-life decision making problem is given to illustrate the application of the uncertain chromatic set and the effectiveness of the uncertain chromatic algorithm.","Isnaini Rosyida1,2, Jin Peng3, Lin Chen4, Widodo Widodo1, Ch.

2440,The mutual influence of aircraft aerodynamics and ship hydrodynamics in theory and experiment,"As early as 1784, sharp-eyed engineers and scientists noted striking similarities between the dynamics of seagoing vessels and aerial vehicles. By the early twentieth century, naval engineers and scientists were developing and designing airplanes and dirigibles using empirical principles derived from naval architecture. Several key researchers in aerodynamics began their career as naval architects (David A. Taylor, William F. Durand and Jerome C. Hunsaker) and carried out their experiments in ship testing facilities. By the 1930s, however, the transfer of knowledge was irrevocably reversed as empiricism gave way to more fundamental, physics-based research. The rapid evolution of complex aircraft systems and flight envelopes led to new theoretical developments in aerodynamics and maneuvering, which quickly found their way into naval ship design. The theoretical and experimental results for airfoils, rigid airships and fixed-wing aircraft developed by Ludwig Prandtl, Theodore von Kármán, Max M. Munk and Hilda M. Lyon were employed in the hydrodynamic development of surface ships and submarines. This paper examines how the ideas, concepts and data from one discipline influenced the other and explores the processes by which that knowledge was transferred between disciplines.",Larrie D.

Two variables are used—the total amount of healthy emotionr and the total amount of emotional stresss. A stabilizing factor in the value ofr is the interrelationship between it ands. Differential equations forr ands are readily solved simultaneously with the use of the Laplace transform. Onset of emotional illness is signaled in a feasible way by development of a relationship between the parameters which causess to increase indefinitely with the passage of time. Among the potentially useful conclusions which arise from this relationship is that the presence of psychosomatic disease protects against emotional illness.,Sidney Roston M.D.,The bulletin of mathematical biophysics,1968,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02476674,"Biophysics Volume,Emotional Stress,Mathematical Biophysics,Myxedema,Everyday Environment"

Part II: Numerics,"We consider a one-dimensional steady-state Poisson–Nernst–Planck type model for ionic flow through membrane channels. Improving the classical Poisson–Nernst–Planck models where ion species are treated as point charges, this model includes ionic interaction due to finite sizes of ion species modeled by hard sphere potential from the Density Functional Theory. The resulting problem is a singularly perturbed boundary value problem of an integro-differential system. We examine the problem and investigate the ion size effect on the current–voltage (I–V) relations numerically, focusing on the case where two oppositely charged ion species are involved and only the hard sphere components of the excess chemical potentials are included. Two numerical tasks are conducted. The first one is a numerical approach of solving the boundary value problem and obtaining I–V curves. This is accomplished through a numerical implementation of the analytical strategy introduced by Ji and Liu in [Poisson–Nernst–Planck systems for ion flow with density functional theory for hard-sphere potential: I–V relations and critical potentials.

2454,Inverse Problems in the Theory of Distance-Regular Graphs: Dual 2-Designs,"Let \(\Gamma\) be a distance-regular graph of diameter 3 with a strongly regular graph \(\Gamma_{3}\). Finding the parameters of \(\Gamma_{3}\) from the intersection array of \(\Gamma\) is a direct problem, and finding the intersection array of \(\Gamma\) from the parameters of \(\Gamma_{3}\) is its inverse. The direct and inverse problems were solved by A.A. Makhnev and M.S. Nirova: if a graph \(\Gamma\) with intersection array \(\{k,b_{1},b_{2};1,c_{2},c_{3}\}\) has eigenvalue \(\theta_{2}=-1\), then the graph complementary to \(\Gamma_{3}\) is pseudo-geometric for \(pG_{c_{3}}(k,b_{1}/c_{2})\). Conversely, if \(\Gamma_{3}\) is a pseudo-geometric graph for \(pG_{\alpha}(k,t)\), then \(\Gamma\) has intersection array \(\{k,c_{2}t,k-\alpha+1;1,c_{2},\alpha\}\), where \(k-\alpha+1\leq c_{2}t<k\) and \(1\leq c_{2}\leq\alpha\). Distance-regular graphs \(\Gamma\) of diameter 3 such that the graph \(\Gamma_{3}\) (\(\bar{\Gamma}_{3}\)) is pseudogeometric for a net or a generalized quadrangle were studied earlier. In this paper, we study intersection arrays of distance-regular graphs \(\Gamma\) of diameter 3 such that the graph \(\Gamma_{3}\) (\(\bar{\Gamma}_{3}\)) is pseudogeometric for a dual 2-design \(pG_{t+1}(l,t)\). New infinite families of feasible intersection arrays are found: \(\{m(m^{2}-1),m^{2}(m-1),m^{2};1,1,(m^{2}-1)(m-1)\}\), \(\{m(m+1),(m+2)(m-1),m+2;1,1,m^{2}-1\}\), and \(\{2m(m-1),(2m-1)(m-1),2m-1;1,1,2(m-1)^{2}\}\), where \(m\equiv\pm 1\) (mod 3). The known families of Steiner 2-designs are unitals, designs corresponding to projective planes of even order containing a hyperoval, designs of points and lines of projective spaces \(PG(n,q)\), and designs of points and lines of affine spaces \(AG(n,q)\). We find feasible intersection arrays of a distance-regular graph \(\Gamma\) of diameter 3 such that the graph \(\Gamma_{3}\) (\(\bar{\Gamma}_{3}\)) is pseudogeometric for one of the known Steiner 2-designs.

The innovation of this paper lies in: Introducing necessary factor (the developing countries pricing power) and the application of several international representative indicators to underline the “world” nature of CDM; utilizing different econometric models to obtain noteworthy and more robust results. The authors test the theoretical findings with multiple stationary time series from the launch of CDM to present (2008–2016). The results reveal that sCER price fluctuation shows the characteristic of asymmetry and substantial persistence. There is a strong statistically significant relationship between macroeconomic conditions, coal and oil prices, with the price of sCER. The authors discover that the pricing power of developing countries indeed has a clear but small impact on the sCER price changes, whereas the price elasticity of supply under CDM is so weak. The interaction between EU emission allowances (EUAs) and sCER presents a shift from dependency to substitution.","Chen Zhang1,2, Yaqi Wu1,2 & Yu Yang1,",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-018-6154-8,"Clean development mechanism,econometric analysis,influencing factors,sCER carbon price"

One of our main results is a compactness of critical points under the boundedness assumption of their relative Morse indices which is an analogue of the results of Bahri–Lions (Commun Pure Appl Math 45:1205–1215, 1992) and Angenent–van der Vorst (Math Z 231: 203–248, 1999) for Dirac functionals. To prove this, we give an appropriate definition of relative Morse indices for bounded solutions to \(\mathsf {D}_{g_{\mathbb {R}^{m}}}\psi =|\psi |^{p-1}\psi \) on \(\mathbb {R}^{m}\). We show that for \(m\ge 3\) and \(1<p<\frac{m+1}{m-1}\), the relative Morse index of any non-trivial bounded solution to that equation is \(+\infty \). We also give some useful properties of the relative Morse indices of Dirac functionals which will be used in the study of the topic (ii) above.",Takeshi Isobe,Journal of Fixed Point Theory and Applications,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11784-016-0391-z,"Relative Morse index,Compactness,Dirac equations"

2472,Superposition Decides the First-Order Logic Fragment Over Ground Theories,"The hierarchic superposition calculus over a theory T, called SUP(T), enables sound reasoning on the hierarchic combination of a theory T with full first-order logic, FOL(T). If a FOL(T) clause set enjoys a sufficient completeness criterion, the calculus is even complete. Clause sets over the ground fragment of FOL(T) are not sufficiently complete, in general. In this paper we show that any clause set over the ground FOL(T) fragment can be transformed into a sufficiently complete one, and prove that SUP(T) terminates on the transformed clause set, hence constitutes a decision procedure provided the existential fragment of the theory T is decidable. Thanks to the hierarchic design of SUP(T), the decidability result can be extended beyond the ground case. We show SUP(T) is a decision procedure for the non-ground FOL fragment plus a theory T, if every non-constant function symbol from the underlying FOL signature ranges into the sort of the theory T, and every term of the theory sort is ground. Examples for T are in particular decidable fragments of arithmetic.",Evgeny Kruglov1 & Christoph Weidenbach,Mathematics in Computer Science,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11786-012-0135-4,"Theorem proving,Combination of theories,Decision procedure,Arithmetic"

The category of spaces and proper maps is a subcategory of the category of exterior spaces.In this paper we show that the category of exterior spaces has a family of closed simplicial model structures, in the sense of Quillen, depending on a pair {T,T′} of suitable exterior spaces. For this goal, for a given exterior space T, we construct the exterior T-homotopy groups of an exterior space under T. Using different spaces T we have as particular cases the main proper homotopy groups: the Brown–Grossman, Čerin–Steenrod, p-cylindrical, Baues–Quintero and Farrell–Taylor–Wagoner groups, as well as the standard (Hurewicz) homotopy groups.The existence of this model structure in the category of exterior spaces has interesting applications. For instance, using different pairs {T,T′}, it is possible to study the standard homotopy type, the homotopy type at infinity and the global proper homotopy type.","J. M. Garcia-Calcines1, M.

The emergence appears to have been, from the very start, both transdisciplinary (function theory, calculus of variations, differential geometry) and international, although the AMS-Göttingen connection played a specific part. First used as an expository and didactic tool (e.g. by Osgood), it soon played a crucial part in the creation of new mathematical concepts (e.g. in Hahn’s work), in the shaping of research agendas (e.g. Blaschke’s global differential geometry), and in Weyl’s axiomatic foundation of the manifold concept.

Each request has a source, destination, and release time. We study a variation of this problem where each request also has a revenue that the server earns for fulfilling the request. The goal is to serve requests within a time limit while maximizing the total revenue. We first prove that no deterministic online algorithm can be competitive unless the input graph is complete and edge weights are unit. We therefore focus on these graphs and present a 2-competitive algorithm for this problem. We also consider two variations of this problem: (1) the input graph is complete bipartite and (2) there is a single node that is the source for every request, and present a 1-competitive algorithm for the former and an optimal algorithm for the latter. We also provide experimental results for the complete and complete bipartite graphs. Our simulations support our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our algorithms perform well under settings that reflect realistic dial-a-ride systems.","Ananya Christman

2499,Game-Theory-Based Consensus Learning of Double-Integrator Agents in the Presence of Worst-Case Adversaries,"This work proposes a game-theory-based technique for guaranteeing consensus in unreliable networks by satisfying local objectives. This multi-agent problem is addressed under a distributed framework, in which every agent has to find the best controller against a worst-case adversary so that agreement is reached among the agents in the networked team. The construction of such controllers requires the solution of a system of coupled partial differential equations, which is typically not feasible. The algorithm proposed uses instead three approximators for each agent: one to approximate the value function, one to approximate the control law, and a third one to approximate a worst-case adversary. The tuning laws for every controller and adversary are driven by their neighboring controllers and adversaries, respectively, and neither the controller nor the adversary knows each other’s policies.

With this method, semi-infinite soils can be considered as an transverse isotropic half-space, its material functions varying with depth. Dividing the half-space into a series of layers in the direction of depth, the material functions in each layer are simulated by exponential functions. Consequently, the fundamental equations to be solved can be simplified if the Fourier transform with repsect to coordinates is used. We have obtained the relationship between the “layer forces” and “layer displacements”. This finite layer method, in fact, can also be called a semi-analytical method. It possesses those advantages as the usual semi-analytical methods do, and can be used to analyse the problem of the interaction between soils and structures.",Yang Zheng-wen1 nAff2 & Loo Wen-da,Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,1992,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02453334,"finite layer method,transverse isotropy,semi-infinite region,elastodynamics"

We relate minimality of rational realizations with their rational observability, algebraic controllability and canonicity. We show that the existence of a minimal rational realization is implied by the existence of a rational realization. We also specify the relation between birational equivalence of rational realizations and the properties of being canonical and minimal.

2506,Center Manifold Theory for the Motions of Camphor Boats with Delta Function,"Various collective motions of camphor boats have been studied. Camphor boats are self-driven particles that interact with each other through the change of surface tension on water surface by camphor molecules. Consequently, even in a one-dimensional circuit, a congested state or jamming can be observed (Suematsu et al. in Phys Rev E 81:056210, 2010). In this phenomenon, the unidirectional motion of each particle is considered a traveling wave, and the concentration of camphor molecules forms a pulse shape. Hence, each pair of particles interacts with each other like a pulse–pulse interaction. Thus, we expect that the center manifold theories proposed in Ei (J Dyn Differ Equ 14:85–137, 2002) and Ei et al. (Physica D 165:176–198 2002) are applicable for the analysis of the collective motion of camphor boats. However, spatial discontinuity in our model, in particular the existence of Dirac delta functions in a linearized operator, does not fulfill the requirement in the reduction process because the authors developed their theories in \(L^2\)-framework and for smooth nonlinearity in Ei (2002) and Ei et al. (2002). In this article, we extend the results obtained in Ei (2002) and Ei et al. (2002) and establish a new center manifold approach in \((H^1)^*\)-framework. Finally, we succeed to rigorously reduce a mathematical model (Nagayama et al. in Physica D: Nonlinear Phenom 194:151–165, 2004) coupled with a Newtonian equation and a reaction–diffusion equation including delta functions to an ordinary differential system that represents the motions of camphor boats.","Kota Ikeda

Furthermore we deduce finiteness conditions for MC . As an application, we compute both minimum numbers explicitly in four concrete geometric sample situations. The Nielsen decomposition of a coincidence set is induced by the decomposition of a certain path space  into path components. Its higher-dimensional topology captures further crucial geometric coincidence data. An analoguous approach can be used to define also Nielsen numbers of certain link maps.",Ulrich Koschorke,Fixed Point Theory and Applications,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1155/FPTA/2006/84093,"Differential Geometry,Theoretic Method,Computational Biology,Coincidence Theory,Nielsen Coincidence"

However the basic postulates of the DWT show that this theory can hardly describe any quantum rules of the microscopic world. In the double wave descriptions, the wave feature of the behavior of microscopic particles and the discontinuity characteristic of energy almost disappear. The discussions on several problems of the radiation atoms made by the DWT’s proposer on the basis of this theory are either mathematically incorrect or inconsistent with experiments and the usual theory.",Fanghao Liang,Science in China Series A: Mathematics,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02878722,"double wave functions,particle ensemble,single particle,result of measurement of physical quantity,double wave theory (DWT)"

We prove that with this complex Banach manifold structure, the space is complete and, moreover, is the completion of the space of all smooth potentials as well as the space of all classical Gibbs measures. There is a maximum metric on the space, which is incomplete.

The derivation explicitly accounts for the stochastic components of evolutionary change and is based on ecological processes at the level of the individual. We show that the coevolutionary dynamic can be envisaged as a directed random walk in the community's trait space. A quantitative description of this stochastic process in terms of a master equation is derived. By determining the first jump moment of this process we abstract the dynamic of the mean evolutionary path. To first order the resulting equation coincides with a dynamic that has frequently been assumed in evolutionary game theory. Apart from recovering this canonical equation we systematically establish the underlying assumptions. We provide higher order corrections and show that these can give rise to new, unexpected evolutionary effects including shifting evolutionary isoclines and evolutionary slowing down of mean paths as they approach evolutionary equilibria. Extensions of the derivation to more general ecological settings are discussed. In particular we allow for multi-trait coevolution and analyze coevolution under nonequilibrium population dynamics.",Ulf Dieckmann1 nAff2 & Richard Law,Journal of Mathematical Biology,1996,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02409751,"Coevolution,Stochastic processes,Mutation-selection systems,Individual-based models,Population dynamics,Adaptive dynamics"

In the present paper, we present a computational theory for the motion of spiral point vortices in two-dimensional exterior domains that contain multiple rectilinear line segments as boundaries, called slit domains. The theory consists of the evolution equation for spiral point vortices in multiply connected domains and a numerical procedure to construct conformal mappings from multiply connected domains with circular boundaries onto given slit domains. It is applicable to many flow problems arising in biofluids and environmental flows. As an example, we apply the theory to the flow problem of finding force-enhancing equilibria consisting of two spiral point vortices in a slit domain with two parallel plates in the presence of a uniform flow, which is a two-dimensional model of a wind-turbine with vertical blades.","Naoki Aoyama1,2, Takashi Sakajo1,2 & Hidehiro Tanaka1,",Japan Journal of Industrial and Applied Mathematics,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13160-013-0113-5,"Spiral point vortices,Multiply connected domains,Conformal mapping,Schottky–Klein prime function"

Such an equation is called integrable if it can be included in an infinite hierarchy of compatible Hamiltonian equations, which admit an infinite sequence of linearly independent integrals of motion in involution. The construction of a hierarchy and its integrals of motion is achieved by making use of the so called Lenard scheme. We find simple conditions which guarantee that the scheme produces an infinite sequence of closed 1-forms \(\omega_j, j \in {\mathbb {Z}}_+\), of the variational complex Ω. If these forms are exact, i.e., ω
j
 are variational derivatives of some local functionals ∫ h

j
, then the latter are integrals of motion in involution of the hierarchy formed by the corresponding Hamiltonian vector fields. We show that the complex Ω is exact, provided that the algebra of functions is \(\fancyscript {V}\) is “normal”; in particular, for arbitrary \(\fancyscript {V}\), any closed form in Ω becomes exact if we add to \(\fancyscript {V}\) a finite number of antiderivatives. We demonstrate on the examples of the KdV, HD and CNW hierarchies how the Lenard scheme works. We also discover a new integrable hierarchy, which we call the CNW hierarchy of HD type. Developing the ideas of Dorfman, we extend the Lenard scheme to arbitrary Dirac structures, and demonstrate its applicability on the examples of the NLS, pKdV and KN hierarchies.","Aliaa Barakat1, Alberto De Sole2 & Victor G.

2530,The existence of almost periodic solution: via coincidence degree theory,"In the present paper, a new method is developed to study the existence of an almost periodic solution for the ordinary or functional differential equations. The approaches are based on topological degree and novel estimation techniques for the a priori bounds of unknown solutions for \(Lx=\lambda Nx\). To investigate the existence of an almost periodic solution, a few good methods have been presented in the previous literature (such as using the Lyapunov function, averaging, exponential dichotomy, stability, separate conditions, and so on). But topological degree theory was never employed to study the almost periodic differential equations. Though Mawhin’s coincidence degree is employed to study the existence of periodic differential equations extensively, it cannot be applied to study the almost periodic systems immediately. Some essentially new and interesting lemmas should be proved before applying topological degree theory to almost periodic systems. To the best knowledge of the authors’, it is the first time that topological degree theory is employed to study the existence of almost periodic solution and this method can be seen as a good supplement to the known methods. Therefore, it will be of great significance to study the almost periodic systems by using this method. The approach followed in the paper could be further generalized to investigate the existence of almost periodic oscillatory in some other nonlinear dynamical systems.

Copositive tensors have found important applications in polynomial optimization, tensor complementarity problems and vacuum stability of a general scalar potential. In this paper, we consider copositivity detection of tensors from both theoretical and computational points of view. After giving several necessary conditions for copositive tensors, we propose several new criteria for copositive tensors based on the representation of the multivariate form in barycentric coordinates with respect to the standard simplex and simplicial partitions. It is verified that, as the partition gets finer and finer, the concerned conditions eventually capture all strictly copositive tensors. Based on the obtained theoretical results with the help of simplicial partitions, we propose a numerical method to judge whether a tensor is copositive or not. The preliminary numerical results confirm our theoretical findings.","Haibin Chen1, Zheng-Hai Huang2 & Liqun Qi",Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-017-1131-2,"Symmetric tensor,Strictly copositive tensor,Positive semi-definiteness,Simplicial partition"

To solve the conflict management problem of D–S theory, an improved belief \(\chi 2\) divergence (called \({\mathcal {I}}{\mathcal {B}}\chi ^2\)) is proposed in this paper. The \({\mathcal {I}}{\mathcal {B}}\chi ^2\) divergence takes into account the amount of all possible hypotheses, which allow it be a more credible and efficient solution to measure the dissimilarity between evidences. Moreover, it has good mathematical properties including symmetry, boundedness and non-degeneracy.

In the case of gaussian connection weights, we use the same techniques as Ben Arous and Guionnet (see [3]) to prove that the image law of the distribution of the neurons' activation states by the empirical measure satisfies a temperature free large deviation principle. Moreover, we prove that if the connection weights satisfy a general condition of domination by gaussian tails, then the distribution of the activation potential of each neuron converges weakly towards an explicit gaussian law, the characteristics of which are contained in the mean-field equations stated by Cessac-Doyon-Quoy-Samuelides (see [4–6]). Furthermore, under this hypothesis, we obtain a law of large numbers and a propagation of chaos result. Finally, we show that many classical distributions on the couplings fulfill our general condition.

We also provide two sufficient and verifiable conditions for a nondecreasing function to be the spectral function of a singular Sturm Liouville operator.",Amin Boumenir1 & Vu Kim Tuan,Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00041-005-5075-9,"Differential Equation,Partial Differential Equation,Fourier Analysis,Spectral Function,Limit Point"
2567,Game Theory and the Evolution of Cooperation,"Evolution is based on the competition between individuals and therefore rewards only selfish behavior. How cooperation or altruism behavior could prevail in social dilemma then becomes a problematic issue. Game theory offers a powerful mathematical approach for studying social behavior. It has been widely used to explain the evolution of cooperation. In this paper, we first introduce related static and dynamic game methods. Then we review two types of mechanisms that can promote cooperation in groups of genetically unrelated individuals, (i) direct reciprocity in repeated games, and (ii) incentive mechanisms such as reward and punishment.",Bo-Yu Zhang1 & Shan Pei,Journal of the Operations Research Society of China,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40305-021-00350-z,"Cooperation,Game theory,Direct reciprocity,Reward,Punishment"
2568,Mathematical controllability theory of the growth of wealth of nations,"Inspired on one hand, by a full Keynesian model and its IS-LM representation in equilibrium [28], [18, p.72], and on the other by the Kalecki [23], Goodwin [13] dynamics of income and capital stock, we derive a nonlinear functional differential equation of neutral type as the dynamics of the growth of wealth of nations. The functions which monitor an individual firm’s initiative or government interventions are carefully identified as control instruments in a differential game of pursuit. This is a reasonable setting [29, pp.79–91]. The nonlinear equations derived are generalizations of ordinary differential systems studied by Takayama [33, pp.685–706], Arrow [2, p.184], Knowles [26, p.3] and Isaacs [20], and the delay systems studied by Kalecki [23], Allen [1, p.254], and Cooke and Yorke [12]. Given an initial (capital/income) fluctuating endowment ϕ we investigate conditions on the systems parameters and on the private and public policy instruments which will guarantee that ϕ can be steered to some fixed (growing trend) target in some finite time. From the controllability theorems proved for hereditary systems, we derive universal laws for the control of growth of wealth of nations. These laws provide broad, starting, but obvious policy prescription for the growth of companies and for national economies. For example, it describes how big government interventions on the firms (in the form of monetary policy, public expenditure and taxation) must be relative to the firms autonomous consumption, export, investment, and real money demand (private initiative) to ensure the growth of capital stock to the given target. It also states when this growth is impossible. Fixed point theorems and argument from the theory of games of pursuit [16] are used.",Ethelbert N.
