0,0,Blow-up analysis for approximate Dirac-harmonic maps in dimension 2 with applications to the Dirac-harmonic heat flow,"Dirac-harmonic maps couple a second order harmonic map type system with a first nonlinear Dirac equation. We consider approximate Dirac-harmonic maps \(\{(\phi _n,\psi _n)\}\), that is, maps that satisfy the Dirac-harmonic system up to controlled error terms. We show that such approximate Dirac-harmonic maps defined on a Riemann surface, that is, in dimension 2, continue to satisfy the basic properties of blow-up analysis like the energy identity and the no neck property. The assumptions are such that they hold for solutions of the heat flow of Dirac-harmonic maps. That flow turns the harmonic map type system into a parabolic system, but simply keeps the Dirac equation as a nonlinear first order constraint along the flow. As a corollary of the main result of this paper, when such a flow blows up at infinite time at interior points, we obtain an energy identity and the no neck property.","Jürgen Jost1, Lei Liu1 & Miaomiao Zhu",Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00526-017-1202-0,53C43 (58E20)

In the case of noninteger parameters, the decomposing measure is described in terms of determinantal point processes (Borondin and Olshanski, 2005). The aim of the present paper is to describe the decomposition for integer parameters; in this case, the spectrum of the decompositions changes drastically. A similar result was earlier obtained for the infinite symmetric group (Kerov, Olshanski, and Vershik, 2004), but the case of the unitary group turned out to be much more complicated.

Unfortunately, the traditional Melnikov methods strongly depend on small parameters, which do not exist in most practical systems. Those methods are limited in dealing with the systems with strong nonlinearities. This paper presents a procedure to study the chaos and sub-harmonic resonance of strongly nonlinear practical systems by employing a homotopy method that is used to extend the Melnikov functions to the strongly nonlinear systems. Applied to a given example, the procedure shows the effectiveness via the comparison of the theoretical results and the numerical simulation.","Yan-bin Liu

This improves our earlier joint effort with Yuquan Zhong by removing a certain condition of symmetry in Khoshnevisan et al. (Ann Probab 31(2):1097–1141, 2003). Moreover, we show that under mild regularity conditions, our necessary and sufficient condition can be recast in terms of one-potential densities. This rests on developing results in classical (non-probabilistic) harmonic analysis that might be of independent interest. As was shown in Khoshnevisan et al.

In this paper, we consider a class of examples where Λ is not assumed to be a lattice. Instead Λ is assumed to have a certain inhomogeneous form, and we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for Ω to be a fundamental domain for some lattice in {ofR}n. We are thus able to decide the question, ‘fundamental domain or not’, by considering only properties of the spectrum Λ.

47,0,New matrix method for response analysis of circumferentially stiffened non-circular cylindrical shells under harmonic pressure,"Based on the governing equation of vibration of a kind of cylindrical shells written in a matrix differential equation of the first order, a new matrix method is presented for steady-state vibration analysis of a noncircular cylindrical shell simply supported at two ends and circumferentially stiffened by rings under harmonic pressure. Its difference from the existing works by Yamada and Irie is that the matrix differential equation is solved by using the extended homogeneous capacity precision integration approach other than the Runge-Kutta-Gill integration method. The transfer matrix can easily be determined by a high precision integration scheme. In addition, besides the normal interacting forces, which were commonly adopted by researchers earlier, the tangential interacting forces between the cylindrical shell and the rings are considered at the same time by means of the Dirac-δ function. The effects of the exciting frequencies on displacements and stresses responses have been investigated. Numerical results show that the proposed method is more efficient than the aforementioned method.","Zou Shi-zhi

48,0,Analysis of biochemical phase shift oscillators by a harmonic balancing technique,"The use of harmonic balancing techniques for theoretically investigating a large class of biochemical phase shift oscillators is outlined and the accuracy of this approximate technique for large dimension nonlinear chemical systems is considered. It is concluded that for the equations under study these techniques can be successfully employed to both find periodic solutions and to indicate those cases which can not oscillate. The technique is a general one and it is possible to state a step by step procedure for its application. It has a substantial advantage in producing results which are immediately valid for arbitrary dimension. As the accuracy of the method increases with dimension, it complements classical small dimension methods.The results obtained by harmonic balancing analysis are compared with those obtained by studying the local stability properties of the singular points of the differential equation. A general theorem is derived which identifies those special cases where the results of first order harmonic balancing are identical to those of local stability analysis, and a necessary condition for this equivalence is derived. As a concrete example, the n-dimensional Goodwin oscillator is considered where ϱ, the Hill coefficient of the feedback metabolite, is equal to three and four. It is shown that for ϱ =3 or 4 and n≤4 the approximation indicates that it is impossible to construct a set of physically permissible reaction constants such that the system possesses a periodic solution. However for n≥5 it is always possible to find a large domain in the reaction constant space giving stable oscillations. A means of constructing such a parameter set is given. The results obtained here are compared with previously derived results for ϱ=1 and ϱ=2.", P.

54,0,Some topics in the history of harmonic analysis in the twentieth century,"In December 2015 I gave a series of six lectures at the Indian Institute of Science in which I sketched the thematic development of some of the main techniques and results of 20th-century harmonic analysis. The subjects of the lectures were, briefly, as follows:   1. Fourier series, 1900-1950.   2. Singular integrals (part I).   3. Hp, BMO, and singular integrals (part II).   4. Littlewood-Paley theory: the history of a technique.   5. Harmonic analysis on groups.   6. Wavelets.   I emphasized interconnections, both the way in which the material in the first lecture provided the roots out of which most of the developments in the other lectures grew, and the ways in which those developments interacted with each other. I included sketches of as many proofs as the time would permit: some very brief, but some fairly complete, especially those whose methodology is an important part of the subject. Much was omitted, of course, and there was a natural bias toward the areas where I have spent periods of my own mathematical life. Many developments, particularly those of the final quarter-century, received at most a brief mention.This paper is a written account of these lectures with a few more details fleshed out, a few topics reorganized, and a few items added. I hope that others may find it an interesting narrative and a useful reference, and that it may lead some of them to share my enjoyment of exploring the original sources. I have tried to provide the references to those sources wherever possible, and for the more recent developments I also provide references to various expository works as the occasion arises.

Then,SL(2, ℂ)-harmonic analysis, in the noncompact picture of induced representations, is used to decompose patterns into the components invariant under irreducible representations of the principal series ofSL(2, ℂ). Usefulness in digital image processing problems is studied by providing a camera model in which the action ofSL(2, ℂ) on the complex image plane corresponds to, and exhausts, planar central projections as produced when aerial images of the same scene are taken from different vantage points.

The physical origin of these problems is explained, and then the mathematical models are developed. Three notions emerge as central to the programme: positive operator-valued (POV) measures on a Hilbert space, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and fibre bundle formulations of quantum geometries. A close connection between the first two notions is shown to exist, which provides a natural setting for introducing a fibration on the associated overcomplete family of vectors. The introduction of group covariance leads to an extended version of harmonic analysis on phase space. It also yields a theory of induced group representations, which extends the results of Mackey on imprimitivity systems for locally compact groups to the more general case of systems of covariance. Quantum geometries emerge as fibre bundles whose base spaces are manifolds of mean stochastic locations for quantum test particles (i.e., spacetime excitons) that display a phase space structure, and whose fibres and structure groups contain, respectively, the aforementioned overcomplete families of vectors and unitary group representations of phase space systems of covariance.",S.

84,0,Harmonic analysis on the infinite symmetric group,"The infinite symmetric group S(∞), whose elements are finite permutations of {1,2,3,...}, is a model example of a “big” group. By virtue of an old result of Murray–von Neumann, the one–sided regular representation of S(∞) in the Hilbert space ℓ2(S(∞)) generates a type II1 von Neumann factor while the two–sided regular representation is irreducible. This shows that the conventional scheme of harmonic analysis is not applicable to S(∞): for the former representation, decomposition into irreducibles is highly non–unique, and for the latter representation, there is no need of any decomposition at all. We start with constructing a compactification \(\mathfrak{S}\supset{S(\infty)}\), which we call the space of virtual permutations. Although \(\mathfrak{S}\) is no longer a group, it still admits a natural two–sided action of S(∞). Thus, \(\mathfrak{S}\) is a G–space, where G stands for the product of two copies of S(∞). On \(\mathfrak{S}\), there exists a unique G-invariant probability measure μ1, which has to be viewed as a “true” Haar measure for S(∞). More generally, we include μ1 into a family {μ t : t>0} of distinguished G-quasiinvariant probability measures on virtual permutations. By making use of these measures, we construct a family {T z : z∈ℂ} of unitary representations of G, called generalized regular representations (each representation T z  with z≠=0 can be realized in the Hilbert space \(L^2(\mathfrak{S}, \mu_t)\), where t=|z|2). As |z|→∞, the generalized regular representations T z  approach, in a suitable sense, the “naive” two–sided regular representation of the group G in the space ℓ2(S(∞)). In contrast with the latter representation, the generalized regular representations T z  are highly reducible and have a rich structure. We prove that any T z  admits a (unique) decomposition into a multiplicity free continuous integral of irreducible representations of G. For any two distinct (and not conjugate) complex numbers z1, z2, the spectral types of the representations \(T_{z_1}\) and \(T_{z_2}\) are shown to be disjoint. In the case z∈ℤ, a complete description of the spectral type is obtained. Further work on the case z∈ℂ∖ℤ reveals a remarkable link with stochastic point processes and random matrix theory.

To address this problem, by adequately utilizing the stochastic response analysis approach and performing the stochastic response for the considered non-smooth system with the external excitation force and white noise excitation, a modified conducting process has proposed. Taking the multiple nonlinear parameters, the non-smooth parameters, and the external excitation frequency into consideration, the steady-state stochastic P-bifurcation phenomena of an elastic impact oscillator are discussed.

95,0,Harmonic analysis of fractal measures,"We consider affine systems inR n constructed from a given integral invertible and expansive matrixR, and a finite setB of translates,σ bx:=R–1x+b; the corresponding measure μ onR n is a probability measure fixed by the self-similarity\(\mu = \left| B \right|^{ - 1} \sum\nolimits_{b \in B} {\mu o\sigma _b^{ - 1} } \). There are twoa priori candidates for an associated orthogonal harmonic analysis: (i) the existence of some subset Λ inR n such that the exponentials {eiλ·x}Λ form anorthogonal basis forL 2(μ); and (ii) the existence of a certaindual pair of representations of theC *-algebraO N wheren is the cardinality of the setB. (For eachN, theC *-algebraO N is known to be simple; it is also called the Cuntz algebra.) We show that, in the “typical” fractal case, the naive version (i) must be rejected; typically the orthogonal exponentials inL 2(μ) fail to span a dense subspace. Instead we show that theC *-algebraic version of an orthogonal harmonic analysis, namely (ii), is a natural substitute. It turns out that this version is still based on exponentialse iλ·x, but in a more indirect way. (See details in Section 5 below.) Our main result concerns the intrinsic geometric features of affine systems, based onR andB, such that μ has theC *-algebra property (ii). Specifically, we show that μ has an orthogonal harmonic analysis (in the sense (ii)) if the system (R, B) satisfies some specific symmetry conditions (which are geometric in nature). Our conditions for (ii) are stated in terms of two pieces of data: (a) aunitary generalized Hadamard matrix, and (b) a certainsystem of lattices which must exist and, at the same time, be compatible with the Hadamard matrix.

97,0,Problems of almost everywhere convergence related to harmonic analysis and number theory,"The object of this paper is to discuss certain methods for studying almost everywhere convergence problems. We consider the generalization of the Riesz-Raikov theorem where the dilation numberϑ>1 is not necessarily an integer. It is known (see [B2]) that the averages (1/N)Σ N1  f(ϑ n x) converge a.e. to ∝ 10  fdx wheneverϑ is algebraic andf a 1-periodic function onR satisfying ∝ 10 |f(x)|2 dx<∞. Here the particular case of rational dilation is treated. The reader is referred to [B2] for the general (algebraic) case.The following definitive relation between a.e. convergence and algebraic numbers is proved. Let {μ j} be the sequence of measures\(\mu _j = \mathop * \limits_{k = 1}^j \left( {\frac{1}{2}\delta _{ - \xi } + \frac{1}{2}\delta _\xi k} \right), \xi = \theta ^{ - 1} \) converging weak* to the natural measureμ on the Cantor set of dissection ratioϑ. Thenf*μ j→f*μ a.e. for allL ∞ (T) functions iffϑ is algebraic. This fact depends on [B3] and a variant of Rota’s theorem [Ro] on a.e. convergence of certain compositions of operators. Further applications of this result in ergodic theory are presented in the last section of the paper. In section 4, a.e. convergence of Riemann sums of periodicL 2-functions is investigated. It is shown that almost surelyR n f has a logarithmic density, where\(R_n f\left( x \right) = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_0^{n - 1} {f\left( {x + \frac{j}{n}} \right)} \).

Sawyer on the connection between the decay rate of the Fourier transform of the surface measure on S and the L p-boundedness of the associated maximal operator \( \mathcal{M} \), and a conjecture by Iosevich and Sawyer which relates the L p-boundedness of \( \mathcal{M} \) to an integrability condition on S for the distance to tangential hyperplanes, in dimension 3.In particular, we also give essentially sharp uniform estimates for the Fourier transform of the surface measure on S, thus extending a result by V. N. Karpushkin from the analytic to the smooth setting and implicitly verifying a conjecture by V. I. Arnold in our context. As an immediate application of this, we obtain an \( {L^p}\left( {{\mathbb{R}^3}} \right) - {L^2}(S) \) Fourier restriction theorem for S.","Isroil A.

112,0,"From Harmonic Maps to the Nonlinear Supersymmetric Sigma Model of Quantum Field Theory: at the Interface of Theoretical Physics, Riemannian Geometry, and Nonlinear Analysis","Harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces arise from a conformally invariant variational problem. Therefore, on one hand, they are intimately connected with moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, and on the other hand, because the conformal group is noncompact, constitute a prototype for the formation of singularities, the so-called bubbles, in geometric analysis. In theoretical physics, they arise from the nonlinear \(\sigma \)-model of quantum field theory. That model possesses a supersymmetric extension, coupling a harmonic map like field with a nonlinear spinor field. In the physical model, that spinor field is anticommuting. In this contribution, we analyze both a mathematical version with a commuting spinor field and the original supersymmetric version. Moreover, this model gives rise to a further field, a gravitino, that can be seen as the supersymmetric partner of a Riemann surface metric. Altogether, this leads to a beautiful combination of concepts from quantum field theory, structures from Riemannian geometry and Riemann surface theory, and methods of nonlinear geometric analysis.","Jürgen Jost1, Enno Keßler1, Jürgen Tolksdorf1,2, Ruijun Wu1 & …Miaomiao Zhu",Vietnam Journal of Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10013-018-0298-7,"Harmonic maps,Dirac-harmonic maps,Non-linear sigma model,Supersymmetry,Gravitino"

132,0,Operator adapted spectral element methods I: harmonic and generalized harmonic polynomials," The paper presents results on the approximation of functions which solve an elliptic differential equation by operator adapted systems of functions. Compared with standard polynomials, these operator adapted systems have superior local approximation properties. First, the case of Laplace's equation and harmonic polynomials as operator adapted functions is analyzed and rates of convergence in a Sobolev space setting are given for the approximation with harmonic polynomials. Special attention is paid to the approximation of singular functions that arise typically in corners. These results for harmonic polynomials are extended to general elliptic equations with analytic coefficients by means of the theory of Bergman and Vekua; the approximation results for Laplace's equation hold true verbatim, if harmonic polynomials are replaced with generalized harmonic polynomials. The Partition of Unity Method is used in a numerical example to construct an operator adapted spectral method for Laplace's equation that is based on approximating with harmonic polynomials locally.",J.M.

By the nature of the given construction, which is genuinely cartesian, this approach lead to geometric constraints on the domain Ω. In this paper we consider the problem in a larger class of domains, by a spherical approach. Starting from a real-valued function u, and singling out the radial direction, we explicitly construct a harmonic function of the form w = e r v, with v ∈ span(e θ 1,…, e θ  m−1), such that u+w is monogenic, i.e. a null solution of the Dirac operator. As an illustration, the construction is applied to important classes of homogeneous monogenic polynomials and functions.

Our initial motivation to study such questions lies in their applications. The results obtained below enable us to complete earlier work on the structure of complemented subspaces ofL  p -spaces which have extremal euclidean distance.LetA be a realn ×n matrix considered as a linear operator onl  n p  ; l ≦p ≦ ∞. By restricted invertibility ofA, we mean the existence of a subset σ of {1, 2, …,n} such that |σ| ∼n andA acts as an isomorphism when restricted to the linear span of the unit vectorse  i   n i=1  There are various conditions under which this property holds. For instance, if the norm ‖A‖ p  ofA is bounded by a constant independent ofn and the diagonal ofA is the identity matrix, then there exists an index set σ, |σ| ∼n, for which (Rσ) has a bounded inverse σ stands for the restriction map). This is achieved by simply constructing the set σ so that ••R σ(A-I)R σ••p< 12 .The casep=2 is of particular interest. Although the problem is purely Hilbertian, the proofs involve besides the spacel 2 also the spacel 1. The methods are probabilistic and combinatorial. Crucial use is made of Grothendieck’s theorem.The paper also contains a nice application to the behavior of the trigonometric system on sets of positive measure, generalizing results on harmonic density.

221,0,A Semigroup Approach to Harmonic Maps,"We present a semigroup approach to harmonic maps between metric spaces. Our basic assumption on the target space (N,d) is that it admits a “barycenter contraction”, i.e. a contracting map which assigns to each probability measure q on N a point b(q) in N. This includes all metric spaces with globally nonpositive curvature in the sense of Alexandrov as well as all metric spaces with globally nonpositive curvature in the sense of Busemann. It also includes all Banach spaces.The analytic input comes from the domain space (M,ρ) where we assume that we are given a Markov semigroup (pt)t>0. Typical examples come from elliptic or parabolic second-order operators on Rn, from Lévy type operators, from Laplacians on manifolds or on metric measure spaces and from convolution operators on groups. In contrast to the work of Korevaar and Schoen (1993, 1997), Jost (1994, 1997), Eells and Fuglede (2001) our semigroups are not required to be symmetric.The linear semigroup acting, e.g., on the space of bounded measurable functions u:M→R gives rise to a nonlinear semigroup (P *t )t acting on certain classes of measurable maps f:M → N. We will show that contraction and smoothing properties of the linear semigroup (pt)t can be extended to the nonlinear semigroup (P *t )t, for instance, Lp–Lq smoothing, hypercontractivity, and exponentially fast convergence to equilibrium. Among others, we state existence and uniqueness of the solution to the Dirichlet problem for harmonic maps between metric spaces. Moreover, for this solution we prove Lipschitz continuity in the interior and Hölder continuity at the boundary.Our approach also yields a new interpretation of curvature assumptions which are usually required to deduce regularity results for the harmonic map flow: lower Ricci curvature bounds on the domain space are equivalent to estimates of the L1-Wasserstein distance between the distribution of two Brownian motions in terms of the distance of their starting points; nonpositive sectional curvature on the target space is equivalent to the fact that the L1-Wasserstein distance of two distributions always dominates the distance of their barycenters.",Karl-Theodor Sturm,Potential Analysis,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11118-004-7740-z,"harmonic map,barycenter,Markov semigroup,nonlinear Markov operator,NPC space,Hadamard space,Dirichlet problem,coupling,Wasserstein distance"

Among properties of such functions we investigate various types of Harnack estimates on balls and compact sets, weak and strong maximum principles, comparison principles, the Hölder and the Lipschitz estimates and some differentiability properties. The latter one is based on the notion of a weak upper gradient. The Dirichlet problem for functions satisfying the mean value property is studied via the dynamical programming method related to stochastic games. Finally, we discuss and prove the Liouville type theorems. Our results are obtained for various types of measures: continuous with respect to a metric, doubling, uniform, measures satisfying the annular decay condition. Relations between such measures are presented as well. The presentation is illustrated by examples.","Tomasz Adamowicz1, Michał Gaczkowski2 & Przemysław Górka",Revista Matemática Complutense,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13163-018-0272-7,"Dirichlet problem,Doubling measure,Dynamical programming,Harmonic function,Harnack estimate,Hölder continuity,Liouville theorem,Lipschitz continuity,Mean value property,Measure,Metric analysis,Potential theory,Uniform measure,Weak upper gradient"

246,0,A continuation fixed-point iterative method on harmonic generations with strong nonlinear optical effects in multi-layer structures,"A continuation fixed-point iterative method for harmonic generations with strong nonlinear optical effects in one-dimensional nonlinear multi-layer structures, which are governed by the nonlinear Helmholtz systems, is presented in this paper. Three kinds of harmonic generations via \(\chi ^{(2)}\) or \(\chi ^{(3)}\) nonlinear process, which are important phenomena in nonlinear optics, are modeled as the application of our proposed method. In the regime of strong nonlinearity, the theoretical and computational analysis of the model problems encounters enormous challenges due to the discontinuity across layers and the strongly nonlinear coupling of modes. To overcome the difficulties in the nonlinearity and discontinuity, a fixed-point iteration with the finite element method is used to study the nonlinear conversion efficiencies by solving the weak formulations. Furthermore, a continuation technique that depends on the weak formulations to solve three model problems, is introduced to handle the iterative procedure for cases with large nonlinearity. The theoretical framework and numerical algorithm towards a uniform process is offered to study almost all the harmonic generations in \(\chi ^{(2)}\) or \(\chi ^{(3)}\) interaction. With the continuation fixed-point iterative technique, the convergence of the iterative procedure can be ensured, even in the presence of strong nonlinearity. Three numerical experiments with high conversion efficiencies are also presented to show the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method.","Jianhua Yuan1, Jian Yang1, Dan Shi1 & …Wenbao Ai",Computational and Applied Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-015-0267-7,"Finite element methods,Nonlinear Helmholtz equations ,Harmonic generations,Iterative methods,Continuation methods"

This result also hold for functions that are non-tangentially bounded only in a measurable subset of the boundary, and has been extended to rank-one hyperbolic spaces, and also to infinite trees (homogeneous or not). No equivalent of the Lusin area theorem is known on higher rank symmetric spaces, with the exception of the degenerate higher rank case given by the cartesian product of rank-one hyperbolic spaces. Indeed, for products of two discs, an area theorem for jointly harmonic functions was proved by M.P. and P. Malliavin, who introduced a new area function; non-tangential boundedness a.e. is a sufficient condition, but not necessary, for the finiteness of this area integral. Their result was later extended to general products of rank-one hyperbolic spaces by Korányi and Putz. Here we prove an area theorem for jointly harmonic functions on the product of a finite number of infinite homogeneous trees; for the sake of simplicity, we give the proofs for the product of two trees.

The main question studied is whether this implies that Ω has the same property for some positive measure (with in general larger, but still compact, support). We show that this is the case provided every positive harmonic function in Ω is the pointwise limit of a sequence of integrable positive harmonic functions in Ω. Moreover, for N = 2 we give a complete affirmative answer of the main question.

We establish a link between both approaches. The action of σ on VN(G) can be extended to \(\mathcal{B} (L^2(G))\). We study the corresponding space \(\tilde{\mathcal H}_\sigma\) of “σ-harmonic operators”, i.e., fixed points in \({\mathcal B} (L^2(G))\) under the action of σ. We show, under mild conditions on either σ or G, that \(\tilde{\mathcal H}_\sigma\) is in fact a von Neumann subalgebra of \({\mathcal B} (L^2(G))\). Our investigation of \(\tilde{\mathcal H}_\sigma\) relies, in particular, on a notion of support for an arbitrary operator in \({\mathcal B} (L^2(G))\) that extends Eymard’s definition for elements of VN(G). Finally, we present an approach to \(\tilde{\mathcal H}_\sigma\) via ideals in \({\mathcal T} (L^2(G))\), where \({\mathcal T}(L^2(G))\) denotes the trace class operators on L 2(G), but equipped with a product different from composition, as it was pioneered for harmonic functions by Willis.",Matthias Neufang1 & Volker Runde,Mathematische Zeitschrift,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00209-006-0039-6,"Locally compact group,Positive definite function,Fourier algebra,Completely bounded multiplier,Harmonic operator"

Drawing an analogy to the famous Wiener criterion, which characterizes the domains in which the classical Dirichlet problem, with contin¬uous boundary data, can be solved, one may seek to characterize the open sets for which Lp solvability holds, thus allowing for singular boundary data.It has been known for some time that absolute continuity of harmonic measure is closely tied to rectifiability properties of ∂ Ω, but also that rectifiability alone is not sufficient to guarantee absolute continuity. In this note, we survey recent progress in this area, culminating in a geometric charac¬terization of the weak-A∞ property, and hence of solvability of the Lp Dirichlet problem for some finite p.

Compared with the standard finite element methods, the novelty of the proposed method is that we penalize the jumps of the tangential component of its vorticity field. It is proved that if the penalty parameter is a complex number with negative imaginary part, then the CIP-FEM is well-posed without any mesh constraint.

383,0,Harmonic and anharmonic oscillations of a cylindrical plasma in the presence of a uniform axial magnetic field and a steady axial current,"In the present note we have studied the harmonic and anharmonic oscillations of cylindrical plasma using Lagrangian formalism. In order to study the harmonic oscillations, the equations are linearized and the resulting equation for the displacement has been numerically solved. For situations present in thermonuclear reactors, the presence of axial magnetic field is found necessary to make the periods of oscillation to become comparable with the time required for the thermonuclear reactions to set in. A detailed analysis of the anharmonic oscillations reveals that the significant interaction is between the first and the second mode. The fundamental period of anharmonic oscillation is more than the corresponding period of harmonic oscillations by 9·2%. Graphs have been drawn for the amplitudes of relative variations in density and magnetic field and of the time-varying part of anharmonic oscillation.",C. Devanathan1 & C.

388,0,A framework of the harmonic Arnoldi method for evaluating φ-functions with applications to exponential integrators,"In recent years, a great deal of attention has been focused on exponential integrators. The important ingredient to the implementation of exponential integrators is the efficient and accurate evaluation of the so called φ-functions on a given vector. The Krylov subspace method is an important technique for this problem. For this type of method, however, restarts become essential for the sake of storage requirements or due to computational complexities of evaluating matrix function on a reduced matrix of growing size. Another problem in computing φ-functions is the lack of a clear residual notion. The contribution of this work is threefold. First, we introduce a framework of the harmonic Arnoldi method for φ-functions, which is based on the residual and the oblique projection technique. Second, we establish the relationship between the harmonic Arnoldi approximation and the Arnoldi approximation, and compare the harmonic Arnoldi method and the Arnoldi method from a theoretical point of view. Third, we apply the thick-restarting strategy to the harmonic Arnoldi method, and propose a thick-restarted harmonic Arnoldi algorithm for evaluating φ-functions. An advantage of the new algorithm is that we can compute several φ-functions simultaneously in the same search subspace after restarting. The relationship between the error and the residual of the harmonic Arnoldi approximation is also investigated. Numerical experiments show the superiority of our new algorithm over many state-of-the-art algorithms for computing φ-functions.","Gang Wu1,2, Lu Zhang3 & Ting-ting Xu",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-015-9433-0,"Exponential integrators,

The given definition of variationally harmonic maps is slightly more restrictive, but also more natural than the usual definition of stationary harmonic maps. After deducing an energy monotonicity formula, it is possible to derive a regularity theory for variationally harmonic maps with general boundary data. The results include full boundary regularity in the Dirichlet boundary case Γ(x) = {g(x)} for \(g\in C^{2,\alpha}(\partial{\mathcal{M}},{\mathcal{N}})\) if \({\mathcal{N}}\)does not carry a nonconstant harmonic 2-sphere.",Christoph Scheven,Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00526-005-0329-6,"Boundary Condition,System Theory,Riemannian Manifold,Dirichlet Boundary,Boundary Data"

Intrinsic fractional harmonic maps are critical points of an energy whose first variation is a Dirichlet to Neumann map for the harmonic map problem on a half-space with a Riemannian metric which can degenerate/become singular along the boundary, depending on the fractional power. Similarly to the approach used to prove regularity for stationary intrinsic semi-harmonic maps, we take advantage of the connection between fractional harmonic maps and free boundary problems for harmonic maps in order to develop a partial regularity theory for the fractional harmonic maps we consider. In particular, we prove partial regularity for locally minimising harmonic maps with (partially) free boundary data on half-spaces with the aforementioned metrics up to the boundary; fractional harmonic maps then inherit this regularity.

473,0,Denoising and Harmonic Detection Using Nonorthogonal Wavelet Packets in Industrial Applications,"New industrial applications call for new methods and new ideas in signal analysis. Wavelet packets are new tools in industrial applications and they have just recently appeared in projects and patents. In training neural networks, for the sake of dimensionality and of ratio of time, compact information is needed. This paper deals with simultaneous noise suppression and signal compression of quasi-harmonic signals. A quasi-harmonic signal is a signal with one dominant harmonic and some more sub harmonics in superposition. Such signals often occur in rail vehicle systems, in which noisy signals are present. Typically, they are signals which come from rail overhead power lines and are generated by intermodulation phenomena and radio interferences. An important task is to monitor and recognize them. This paper proposes an algorithm to differentiate discrete signals from their noisy observations using a library of nonorthonormal bases. The algorithm combines the shrinkage technique and techniques in regression analysis using Shannon Entropy function and Cross Entropy function to select the best discernable bases. Cosine and sine wavelet bases in wavelet packets are used. The algorithm is totally general and can be used in many industrial applications. The effectiveness of the proposed method consists of using as few as possible samples of the measured signal and in the meantime highlighting the difference between the noise and the desired signal. The problem is a difficult one, but well posed. In fact, compression reduces the level of the measured noise and undesired signals but introduces the well known compression noise. The goal is to extract a coherent signal from the measured signal which will be “well represented” by suitable waveforms and a noisy signal or incoherent signal which cannot be “compressed well” by the waveforms. Recursive residual iterations with cosine and sine bases allow the extraction of elements of the required signal and the noise. The algorithm that has been developed is utilized as a filter to extract features for training neural networks. It is currently integrated in the inferential modelling platform of the unit for Advanced Control and Simulation Solutions within ABB’s industry division. An application using real measured data from an electrical railway line is presented to illustrate and analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method. Another industrial application in fault detection, in which coherent and incoherent signals are univocally visible, is also shown.",P.

If \(M\) is a simply-connected non-flat space form other than the 2-sphere, examples are obtained of conformal vector fields that are harmonic.

490,0,Incremental harmonic balance method for periodic forced oscillation of a dielectric elastomer balloon,"Dielectric elastomer (DE) is suitable in soft transducers for broad applications, among which many are subjected to dynamic loadings, either mechanical or electrical or both. The tuning behaviors of these DE devices call for an efficient and reliable method to analyze the dynamic response of DE. This remains to be a challenge since the resultant vibration equation of DE, for example, the vibration of a DE balloon considered here is highly nonlinear with higher-order power terms and time-dependent coefficients. Previous efforts toward this goal use largely the numerical integration method with the simple harmonic balance method as a supplement. The numerical integration and the simple harmonic balance method are inefficient for large parametric analysis or with difficulty in improving the solution accuracy. To overcome the weakness of these two methods, we describe formulations of the incremental harmonic balance (IHB) method for periodic forced solutions of such a unique system. Combined with an arc-length continuation technique, the proposed strategy can capture the whole solution branches, both stable and unstable, automatically with any desired accuracy.","Yin Wang1,2, Ling Zhang2 & Jinxiong Zhou1,",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-020-2590-7,"dielectric elastomer,nonlinear oscillation,incremental harmonic method,arc-length continuation"

The purpose of this paper is to carefully study the extent to which finite morphisms of algebraic K-curves are controlled by certain combinatorial objects, called skeleta. A skeleton is a metric graph embedded in the Berkovich analytification of X. A skeleton has the natural structure of a metrized complex of curves. We prove that a finite morphism of K-curves gives rise to a finite harmonic morphism of a suitable choice of skeleta. We use this to give analytic proofs of stronger ‘skeletonized’ versions of some foundational results of Liu-Lorenzini, Coleman, and Liu on simultaneous semistable reduction of curves. We then consider the inverse problem of lifting finite harmonic morphisms of metrized complexes to morphisms of curves over K. We prove that every tamely ramified finite harmonic morphism of Λ-metrized complexes of k-curves lifts to a finite morphism of K-curves. If in addition the ramification points are marked, we obtain a complete classification of all such lifts along with their automorphisms. This generalizes and provides new analytic proofs of earlier results of Saïdi and Wewers. As an application, we discuss the relationship between harmonic morphisms of metric graphs and induced maps between component groups of Néron models, providing a negative answer to a question of Ribet motivated by number theory.This article is the first in a series of two.

600,0,"Harmonic and Refined Extraction Methods for the Singular Value Problem, with Applications in Least Squares Problems"," For the accurate approximation of the minimal singular triple (singular value and left and right singular vector) of a large sparse matrix, we may use two separate search spaces, one for the left, and one for the right singular vector. In Lanczos bidiagonalization, for example, such search spaces are constructed. In SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 23(2) (2002), pp. 606–628, the author proposes a Jacobi–Davidson type method for the singular value problem, where solutions to certain correction equations are used to expand the search spaces.  As noted in the mentioned paper, the standard Galerkin subspace extraction works well for the computation of large singular triples, but may lead to unsatisfactory approximations to small and interior triples. To overcome this problem for the smallest triples, we propose three harmonic and a refined approach. All methods are derived in a number of different ways. Some of these methods can also be applied when we are interested in the largest or interior singular triples. Theoretical results as well as numerical experiments indicate that the results of the alternative extraction processes are often better than the standard approach. We show that when Lanczos bidiagonalization is used for the subspace expansion, the standard, harmonic, and refined extraction methods are all essentially equivalent. This gives more insight in the success of Lanczos bidiagonalization to find the smallest singular triples.  Finally, we show that the extraction processes for the smallest singular values may give an approximation to a least squares problem at low additional costs. The truncated SVD is also discussed in this context. ",M. E.

Both classes do not preserve the conformal type of the domain, however they cannot change it in an arbitrary way. Doubly connected domains are where one first observes nontrivial conformal invariants. Herbert Grötzsch and Johannes C.C. Nitsche addressed this issue for quasiconformal and harmonic mappings, respectively. Combining these concepts we obtain sharp estimates for quasiconformal harmonic mappings between doubly connected domains. We then apply our results to the Cauchy problem for minimal surfaces, also known as the Björling problem.

619,0,Boundary Representations of λ-Harmonic and Polyharmonic Functions on Trees,"On a countable tree T, allowing vertices with infinite degree, we consider an arbitrary stochastic irreducible nearest neighbour transition operator P. We provide a boundary integral representation for general eigenfunctions of P with eigenvalue λ ∈ C. This is possible whenever λ is in the resolvent set of P as a self-adjoint operator on a suitable ℓ2-space and the diagonal elements of the resolvent (“Green function”) do not vanish at λ. We show that when P is invariant under a transitive (not necessarily fixed-point-free) group action, the latter condition holds for all λ≠ 0 in the resolvent set. These results extend and complete previous results by Cartier, by Figà-Talamanca and Steger, and by Woess. For those eigenvalues, we also provide an integral representation of λ-polyharmonic functions of any order n, that is, functions \(f: T \to \mathbb {C}\) for which (λ ⋅ I − P)nf = 0. This is a far-reaching extension of work of Cohen et al., who provided such a representation for the simple random walk on a homogeneous tree and eigenvalue λ = 1. Finally, we explain the (much simpler) analogous results for “forward only” transition operators, sometimes also called martingales on trees.","Massimo A. Picardello1 & Wolfgang Woess

620,0,"Harmonic Measure, Equilibrium Measure, and Thinness at Infinity in the Theory of Riesz Potentials","The paper deals with the theory of potentials with respect to the α-Riesz kernel |x − y|α−n of order α ∈ (0,2] on \(\mathbb R^{n}\), \(n\geqslant 3\). Focusing first on the inner α-harmonic measure \({\varepsilon _{y}^{A}}\) (εy being the unit Dirac measure at \(y\in \mathbb R^{n}\), and μA the inner α-Riesz balayage of a Radon measure μ to \(A\subset \mathbb R^{n}\) arbitrary), we describe its Euclidean support, provide a formula for evaluation of its total mass, establish the vague continuity of the map \(y{\mapsto \varepsilon _{y}^{A}}\) outside the inner α-irregular points for A, and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for \({\varepsilon _{y}^{A}}\) to be of finite energy (more generally, for \({\varepsilon _{y}^{A}}\) to be absolutely continuous with respect to inner capacity) as well as for \({\varepsilon _{y}^{A}}(\mathbb R^{n})\equiv 1\) to hold. Those criteria are given in terms of newly defined concepts of inner α-thinness and inner α-ultrathinness of A at infinity that for α = 2 and A Borel coincide with the concepts of outer 2-thinness at infinity by Doob and Brelot, respectively. Further, we extend some of these results to μA general by verifying the integral representation formula \(\mu ^{A}={\int \limits \varepsilon _{y}^{A}} d\mu (y)\). We also show that for every \(A\subset \mathbb R^{n}\), there exists a Kσ-set A0 ⊂ A such that \(\mu ^A=\mu ^{A_0}\) for all μ, and give various applications of this theorem. In particular, we prove the vague and strong continuity of the inner swept, resp. inner equilibrium, measure under an approximation of A arbitrary, thereby strengthening Fuglede’s result established for A Borel (Acta Math., 1960). Being new even for α = 2, the results obtained also present a further development of the theory of inner Newtonian capacities and of inner Newtonian balayage, originated by Cartan.","Natalia Zorii

Based on known ideas and techniques, we separate the necessary analytical assumptions to axiomatizing the theory in the singular setting. More precisely, (1) we extend the existence result of Guo and Wenger (Comm Anal Geom 28(1):89–112, 2020) for solutions to the Dirichlet problem of Korevaar–Schoen energy functional to more general energy functionals in purely singular setting. (2) When Y has non-positive curvature in the sense of Alexandrov (NPC), we show that the ideas of Jost (Calc Var Partial Differ Equ 5(1):1–19, 1997) and Lin (Analysis on singular spaces, collection of papers on geometry, analysis and mathematical physics, World Science Publishers, River Edge, pp 114–126, 1997) can be adapted to the purely singular setting to yield local Hölder continuity of solutions of the Dirichlet problem of Korevaar–Schoen and Kuwae–Shioya. (3) We extend the Liouville theorem of Sturm (J Reine Angew Math 456:173–196, 1994) for harmonic functions to harmonic mappings between singular metric spaces. (4) We extend the theorem of Mayer (Comm Anal Geom 6:199–253, 1998) on the existence of the harmonic mapping flow and solve the corresponding initial boundary value problem. Combing these known ideas, with the more or less standard techniques from analysis on metric spaces based on upper gradients, leads to new results when we consider harmonic mappings from \({{\,\mathrm{RCD}\,}}(K,N)\) spaces into NPC spaces.

In this paper we introduce a notion of Almgren’s frequency functional in any Carnot group \(\mathbb {G}\), and we analyze some local and global consequences of the boundedness of the frequency. Although our results are the counterpart of by now well-known classical ones, their proof is much more delicate and involved than their elliptic predecessors, and serious new obstructions arise. A central motivation for our study is the fundamental open question whether harmonic functions (i.e., solutions of a sub-Laplacian) in a Carnot group \(\mathbb {G}\) of step \(r\ge 2\) possess the strong unique continuation property (scup).

In the process, we uncover two previously unknown features of the Steklov eigenvalues. First, we show that in higher dimensions there is a unique normalization involving both the volume of the boundary and of the manifold itself, which leads to meaningful extremal eigenvalue problems. Second, we observe that the critical points of the eigenvalue functionals in a fixed conformal class have a natural geometric interpretation provided one considers the Steklov problem with a density. As an example, we construct a family of free boundary harmonic annuli in the three-dimensional ball and conjecture that they correspond to metrics maximizing the first Steklov eigenvalue in their respective conformal classes.","Mikhail Karpukhin1 & Antoine Métras

Numerical simulation for different integer and non-integer order laying between (0, 1) has been drawn using Matlab. For different initial data, the result of simulation depicts the solution of the considered model is stable and shows the convergence of a single point. Smaller fractional orders show good results in the framework of stability.","Qu Haidong1, Mati ur Rahman

638,0,"On the error estimate of the harmonic B

z
 algorithm in MREIT from noisy magnetic flux field","Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT, for short) is a new medical imaging technique developed recently to visualize the cross-section conductivity of biologic tissues. A new MREIT image reconstruction method called harmonic B  z  algorithm was proposed in 2002 with the measurement of B  z  that is a single component of an induced magnetic flux density subject to an injection current. The key idea is to solve a nonlinear integral equation by some iteration process. This paper deals with the convergence analysis as well as the error estimate for noisy input data B  z , which is the practical situation for MREIT. By analyzing the iteration process containing the Laplacian operation on the input magnetic field rigorously, the authors give the error estimate for the iterative solution in terms of the noisy level δ and the regularizing scheme for determining ΔB  z  approximately from the noisy input data. The regularizing scheme for computing the Laplacian from noisy input data is proposed with error analysis. Our results provide both the theoretical basis and the implementable scheme for evaluating the reconstruction accuracy using harmonic B  z  algorithm with practical measurement data containing noise.",Qun Chen1 & Jijun Liu,"Chinese Annals of Mathematics, Series B",2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11401-014-0838-8,"MREIT,Image reconstruction,Iteration,Error estimate"

673,0,Vibration reduction evaluation of a linear system with a nonlinear energy sink under a harmonic and random excitation,"The nonlinear behaviors and vibration reduction of a linear system with nonlinear energy sink (NES) are investigated. The linear system is excited by a harmonic and random base excitation, consisting of a mass block, a linear spring, and a linear viscous damper. The NES is composed of a mass block, a linear viscous damper, and a spring with ideal cubic nonlinear stiffness. Based on the generalized harmonic function method, the steady-state Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation is presented to reveal the response of the system. The path integral method based on the Gauss-Legendre polynomial is used to achieve the numerical solutions. The performance of vibration reduction is evaluated by the displacement and velocity transition probability densities, the transmissibility transition probability density, and the percentage of the energy absorption transition probability density of the linear oscillator. The sensitivity of the parameters is analyzed for varying the nonlinear stiffness coefficient and the damper ratio. The investigation illustrates that a linear system with NES can also realize great vibration reduction under harmonic and random base excitations and random bifurcation may appear under different parameters, which will affect the stability of the system.","Jiren Xue1, Yewei Zhang1,2, Hu Ding1 & …Liqun Chen",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-020-2560-6,"nonlinear energy sink (NES),Gauss-Legendre polynomial,transmissibility,percentage of energy absorption"
674,0,The Spherical Harmonic Spectrum of a Function with Algebraic Singularities,"The asymptotic behaviour of the spectral coefficients of a function provides a useful diagnostic of its smoothness. On a spherical surface, we consider the coefficients \(a_{l}^{m}\) of fully normalised spherical harmonics of a function that is smooth except either at a point or on a line of colatitude, at which it has an algebraic singularity taking the form θ p or |θ−θ 0|p respectively, where θ is the co-latitude and p>−1. It is proven that each type of singularity has a signature on the rotationally invariant energy spectrum, \(E(l) = \sqrt{\sum_{m} (a_{l}^{m})^{2}}\) where l and m are the spherical harmonic degree and order, of l −(p+3/2) or l −(p+1) respectively. This result is extended to any collection of finitely many point or (possibly intersecting) line singularities of arbitrary orientation: in such a case, it is shown that the overall behaviour of E(l) is controlled by the gravest singularity. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the results. We discuss the generalisation of singularities on lines of colatitude to those on any closed curve on a spherical surface.",Philip W.

In the present study, the SWCNT is assumed to be a curved beam, which is unlike previous similar work. Firstly, the governing equations of motion are derived by the Hamilton principle, meanwhile, the Galerkin approach is carried out to convert the nonlinear integral-differential equation into a second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. Then, the precise integration method based on the local linearzation is appropriately designed for solving the above dynamic equations. Besides, the numerical example is presented, the effects of the nonlocal parameters, the elastic medium constants, the waviness ratios, and the material lengths on the dynamic response are analyzed. The results show that the above mentioned effects have influences on the dynamic behavior of the SWCNT.","Bo Wang

A set of second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations are obtained by spatial discretization with Galerkin’s method.

The incremental harmonic balance (IHB) method is used to achieve the periodic solutions of the high-dimensional model of the buckled beam to observe the nonlinear frequency response curve and nonlinear amplitude response curve, and the Floquet theory is used to analyze the stability of the periodic solutions. Attention is focused on the subharmonic resonance caused by the internal resonance as the excitation frequency near twice of the first natural frequency of the buckled beam with/without the anti-symmetric modes being excited. Bifurcations including the saddle-node, Hopf, period-doubling, and symmetry-breaking bifurcations are observed.

To this end, we design a plane wave method combined with local spectral elements for the discretization of such nonhomogeneous equations. This method contains two steps: we first solve a series of nonhomogeneous local problems on auxiliary smooth subdomains by the spectral element method, and then apply the plane wave method to the discretization of the resulting (locally homogeneous) residue problem on the global solution domain. We derive error estimates of the approximate solutions generated by this method. The numerical results show that the resulting approximate solutions possess high accuracy.","Qiya Hu1,3 & Long Yuan",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-017-9542-z,"Helmholtz equation,Time-harmonic Maxwell equations,Nonhomogeneous,Local spectral element,Plane wave basis functions,Error estimates"

As a consequence, a new proof of the positive mass theorem is achieved in dimension three. The proof has parallels with both the Schoen–Yau minimal hypersurface technique and Witten’s spinorial approach. In particular, the role of harmonic spinors and the Lichnerowicz formula in Witten’s argument is replaced by that of harmonic functions and a formula introduced by the fourth named author in recent work, while the level sets of harmonic functions take on a role similar to that of the Schoen–Yau minimal hypersurfaces.","Hubert L.

Roughly speaking, we prove that the soliton metric g is locally isometric to one of the following four types: an Einstein metric, the product \( \mathbb {R}^2 \times N_{\lambda }\) of the Euclidean metric and a 2-d Riemannian manifold of constant curvature \({\lambda } \ne 0\), a certain singular metric and a locally conformally flat metric. The method here is motivated by Cao–Chen’s works (in Trans Am Math Soc 364:2377–2391, 2012; Duke Math J 162:1003–1204, 2013) and Derdziński’s study on Codazzi tensors (in Math Z 172:273–280, 1980). Combined with the previous results on locally conformally flat solitons, our characterization yields a new classification of 4-d complete steady solitons with \(\delta W=0\). For the shrinking case, it re-proves the rigidity result (Fernández-López and García-Río in Math Z 269:461–466, 2011; Munteanu and Sesum in J. Geom Anal 23:539–561, 2013) in 4-d.

The main result of this paper states that R m̈ goes to zero uniformly at infinity if for \(p\geq \frac n2\), the L p-norm of R m̈ is finite. Moreover, If R is positive, then (M n, g) is compact. As applications, we prove that (M n, g) is isometric to a spherical space form if for \(p\geq \frac n2\), R is positive and the L p-norm of R m̈ is pinched in [0, C 1), where C 1 is an explicit positive constant depending only on n, p, R and the Yamabe constant.

760,0,Bounds on Harmonic Radius and Limits of Manifolds with Bounded Bakry–Émery Ricci Curvature,"Under the usual condition that the volume of a geodesic ball is close to the Euclidean one or the injectivity radii is bounded from below, we prove a lower bound of the \(C^{\alpha } \cap W^{1, q}\) harmonic radius for manifolds with bounded Bakry–Émery Ricci curvature when the gradient of the potential is bounded. Under these conditions, the regularity that can be imposed on the metrics under harmonic coordinates is only \(C^\alpha \cap W^{1,q}\), where \(q>2n\) and n is the dimension of the manifolds. This is almost 1-order lower than that in the classical \(C^{1,\alpha } \cap W^{2, p}\) harmonic coordinates under bounded Ricci curvature condition (Anderson in Invent Math 102:429–445, 1990). The loss of regularity induces some difference in the method of proof, which can also be used to address the detail of \(W^{2, p}\) convergence in the classical case. Based on this lower bound and the techniques in Cheeger and Naber (Ann Math 182:1093–1165, 2015) and Wang and Zhu (Crelle’s J, http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4490), we extend Cheeger–Naber’s Codimension 4 Theorem in Cheeger and Naber  (2015) to the case where the manifolds have bounded Bakry–Émery Ricci curvature when the gradient of the potential is bounded. This result covers Ricci solitons when the gradient of the potential is bounded. During the proof, we will use a Green’s function argument and adopt a linear algebra argument in Bamler (J Funct Anal 272(6):2504–2627, 2017).

775,0,Layer Potentials for the Harmonic Mixed Problem in the Plane,"The mixed problem is to find a harmonic function having prescribed Dirichlet data on one part of the boundary and prescribed Neumann data on the remainder. One must make a choice as to the required boundary regularity of solutions. When only weak regularity conditions are imposed, the mixed problem has been solved on smooth domains in the plane by Wendland et al. (Math Methods Appl Sci 1(3):265–321, 1979). Significant advances were later made on Lipschitz domains by Ott and Brown (2011) and Brown (Commun Partial Differ Equ 19(7–8):1217–1233, 1994). The strain of requiring a square-integrable gradient on the boundary, however, forces a strong geometric restriction on the domain. Well-known counterexamples by Brown show this restriction to be a necessary condition. This paper shows that these counterexamples are an anomaly, in that the mixed problem in the plane can be solved for all data modulo a finite dimensional subspace. The geometric restriction now required is significantly less stringent than the one referred to above. This result is proved by representing solutions in terms of single and double layer potentials, establishing a mixed Rellich inequality, and applying functional analytic arguments to solve a two-by-two system of equations. These results are then extended to allow Robin data in place of Neumann data.",Moises Venouziou,Potential Analysis,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11118-012-9315-8,"Mixed boundary value problem,Laplace’s equation,Layer potential operator"

In this paper we consider metric measure spaces and construct a parallel transformation of measures under the uniformization and hyperbolization procedures. We show that if a locally compact roughly starlike Gromov hyperbolic space is equipped with a measure that is uniformly locally doubling and supports a uniformly local p-Poincaré inequality, then the transformed measure is globally doubling and supports a global p-Poincaré inequality on the corresponding uniformized space. In the opposite direction, we show that such global properties on bounded locally compact uniform spaces yield similar uniformly local properties for the transformed measures on the corresponding hyperbolized spaces. We use the above results on uniformization of measures to characterize when a Gromov hyperbolic space, equipped with a uniformly locally doubling measure supporting a uniformly local p-Poincaré inequality, carries nonconstant globally defined p-harmonic functions with finite p-energy. We also study some geometric properties of Gromov hyperbolic and uniform spaces. While the Cartesian product of two Gromov hyperbolic spaces need not be Gromov hyperbolic, we construct an indirect product of such spaces that does result in a Gromov hyperbolic space. This is done by first showing that the Cartesian product of two bounded uniform domains is a uniform domain.","Anders Björn

For any x ∈Ω and \(l\in \mathbb {S}^{n-1}\), let CΩ,q(x) and CΩ,q(x;l) denote the optimal numbers for the gradient estimate $ \left |\nabla u(x)\right |\leq \mathbf {C}_{\Omega ,q}(x)\left \|\phi \right \|{\!}_{L^{p}(\partial {\Omega }, \mathbb {R})} $ and the gradient estimate in the direction l $ \left |\langle \nabla u(x),l\rangle \right |\leq \mathbf {C}_{\Omega ,q}(x;l)\left \|\phi \right \|{\!}_{L^{p}(\partial {\Omega }, \mathbb {R})}, $ respectively.

804,0,A Multi-modes Monte Carlo Interior Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Time-Harmonic Maxwell’s Equations with Random Coefficients,This paper develops an efficient Monte Carlo interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (IP-DG) method for electromagnetic wave propagation in random media. This method is based on a multi-modes expansion of the solution to the time-harmonic random Maxwell equations. It is shown that each mode function satisfies a Maxwell system with random sources defined recursively. An unconditionally stable IP-DG method is employed to discretize the nearly deterministic Maxwell system and the Monte Carlo method combined with an efficient acceleration strategy is proposed for computing the mode functions and the statistics of the electromagnetic wave. A complete error analysis is established for the proposed multi-modes Monte Carlo IP-DG method. It is proved that the proposed method converges with an optimal order for each of three levels of approximations. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical results and to gauge the performance of the proposed numerical method and approach. ,"Xiaobing Feng1, Junshan Lin2 & Cody Lorton

805,0,A Spherical Harmonic Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Radiative Transfer Equations with Vacuum Boundary Conditions,"In this paper, we propose and analyze a spherical harmonic discontinuous Galerkin (SH-DG) method for solving the radiative transfer equations with vacuum boundary conditions. To incorporate vacuum boundary conditions in spherical harmonic approximations, we first embed the original domain into a larger computational area of rectangular type with an extra pure absorbing layer and then establish a perturbation problem with a periodic condition at the boundary of the extended domain. Since the outflow radiative intensity at the outer boundary of the extended area can be made arbitrarily small by sufficiently increasing the magnitude of absorption in or the thickness of the absorbing layer, such a replacement of the boundary condition only causes a minimal difference between the solution of the perturbation problem and the original problem in the original domain, but will benefit the construction of the discretization scheme. Then based on the analysis of the perturbation problem and the SH-DG method for solving the radiative transfer equation with periodic boundary conditions, the well-posedness and the error estimates are derived for the approximation solution arising from the SH-DG method for solving the radiative transfer equation with vacuum boundary conditions. Numerical examples with both periodic and vacuum boundary conditions are included to validate the theoretical results.","Qiwei Sheng

The vibration absorption of the parallel and parallel-coupled NESs and the system response induced by the coupling spring are studied. The results show that the responses of the system exhibit a significant difference when the heavier cubic oscillators in the NESs have lower stiffness and the lighter cubic oscillators have higher stiffness. Moreover, the e±ciency of the parallel-coupled NES is higher for medium shocks but lower for small and large shocks than that of the parallel NESs. The parallel-coupled NES also shows superior performance for medium harmonic excitations until higher response branches are induced. The performance of the parallel-coupled NES and the SDOF NES is compared.

To overcome the mathematical difficulties, a one-dimensional non-local kernel is used instead of a two-dimensional one for the dynamic problem to obtain the stress occurring at the crack tips. The Fourier transform is applied and a mixed boundary-value problem is formulated. The solutions are obtained by means of the Schmidt method. This method is more exact and more appropriate than Eringen's for solving this kind of problem. Contrary to the classical elasticity solution, it is found that no stress singularity is present at the crack tip.

We investigate \(\Phi _S\)-harmonic maps or stress-energy stationary maps between Riemannian manifolds. Liouville type theorems for \(\Phi _S\)-harmonic maps from complete Riemannian manifolds are established under some conditions on the Hessian of the distance function and the asymptotic behavior of the map at infinity. By an extrinsic average variational method in the calculus of variations (Han and Wei in \(\Phi \)-harmonic maps and \(\Phi \)-superstrongly unstable manifolds, 2019), we prove that any stable \(\Phi _S\)-harmonic map from or to a compact \(\Phi \)-SSU manifold (to or from any compact manifold) must be constant (cf.

These can be manifolds with natural connections other than the Levi-Civita connection of Riemannian geometry, like Hermitian, affine or Weyl manifolds. The standard harmonic map semilinear elliptic system is augmented by a term coming from a vector field V on the domain and another term arising from a 2-tensor T on the target. In fact, this geometric structure then also includes other geometrically defined maps, for instance magnetic harmonic maps. In this paper, we treat VT-harmonic maps and their parabolic analogues with PDE tools. We establish a Jäger–Kaul type maximum principle for these maps. Using this maximum principle, we prove an existence theorem for the Dirichlet problem for VT-harmonic maps.

This function was first introduced by Walden and  Ward, inspired by a question posed by Stephenson, as a signature that encodes information about the geometry of \(\Omega \). It has subsequently been studied in various works. Two main goals of harmonic measure distribution studies are (1) to understand precisely what can be determined about a domain from its h-function, and (2) given a function \(f:(0,\infty )\rightarrow [0,1]\), to determine whether there exists a pair \((\Omega ,z_0)\) that has f as its h-function. In this survey paper, we present key examples of h-functions and summarize results related to these two goals. In particular, we discuss what is known about uniqueness of domains that generate h-functions, necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for a function to be an h-function, asymptotic behavior of h-functions, and convergence results involving h-functions. We also highlight current open problems.","Marie A. Snipes

In this paper, we consider the basis pursuit principle to find the representation (frequency) coefficients of a harmonic signal by minimizing the l 1 norm.

We define a quantitative stratification, which groups together points in the domain into quantitative weakly singular strata \(\mathcal {S}^j_{\eta ,r}(u)\) according to the number of approximate symmetries of \(u\) at certain scales. We prove that their tubular neighborhoods have small volume, namely \(\mathrm{Vol}\left( T_r(\mathcal {S}^j_{\eta ,r}(u))\right) \le Cr^{m+2-j-\varepsilon }\), where \(C\) depends on \(\eta , \epsilon \) and some additional parameters; for the precise statement see Theorem 1.5.

By restricting ourselves to harmonic homeomorphisms symmetric about the real axis, we establish a two-fold purpose: (a) solve this problem by using the theory of extremal length and (b) test Conjecture 1.4 of loc. cit. regarding the moduli of the doubly connected domains related by harmonic homeomorphisms in light of our results.

890,0,Harmonic forms and near-minimal singular foliations," For a closed 1-form \( \omega \) with Morse singularities, Calabi discovered a simple global criterion for the existence of a Riemannian metric in which \( \omega \) is harmonic. For a codimension 1 foliation \( \cal {F} \), Sullivan gave a condition for the existence of a Riemannian metric in which all the leaves of \( \cal {F} \) are minimal hypersurfaces. The conditions of Calabi and Sullivan are strikingly similar. If a closed form \( \omega \) has no singularities, then both criteria are satisfied and, for an appropriate choice of metric, \( \omega \) is harmonic and the associated foliation \( \cal {F}_\omega \) is comprised of minimal leaves. However, when \( \omega \) has singularities, the foliation \( \cal {F}_\omega \) is not necessarily minimal.¶ We show that the Calabi condition enables one to find a metric in which \( \omega \) is harmonic and the leaves of the foliation are minimal outside a neighborhood U of the \( \omega \)-singular set. In fact, we prove the best possible result of this type: we construct families of metrics in which, as U shrinks to the singular set, the taut geometry of the foliation \( \cal {F}_\omega \) outside U remains stable. Furthermore, all compact leaves missing U are volume minimizing cycles in their homology classes. Their volumes are controlled explicitly. ",G.

The space–time evolution of the fluid is governed by the following system of the Hamilton–Jacobi and the continuity equations: $$\begin{array}{rl}S_{t}+\frac{1}{2}(S_{x}^{2}+\omega^{2}x^{2})&=0,\qquad S(x,0)=S_{0}(x);\\\rho_{t}+(\rho S_{x})_{x}&=0,\qquad \rho(x,0)=\rho_{0}(x).\end{array}$$ Here S and ρ designate the velocity potential and the mass density, respectively. Unless S 0 is convex, shocks form and the velocity S  x  becomes discontinuous in {0<ω t<π/2}. It is demonstrated that there nevertheless exists a unique viscosity–measure solution (S,ρ) when S 0 is globally Lipschitz continuous and locally semi-concave while ρ 0 is a finite Borel measure. The structure of the velocity and the density is exhibited. For initial data correlated in a certain sense, a class of classical solutions (S,ρ) is given. Negative time is also considered, and illustrating examples are given.

By using the Fourier transform, the problem can be solved with a pair of dual integral equations in which the unknown variable is the jumps of the displacements across the crack surfaces. To solve the dual integral equations, the jumps of the displacements across the crack surface were expanded in a series of Jacobi polynomials. The relations among the electric filed, the magnetic flux and the stress field were obtained.

The main idea is to define a scalar index that can represent the cumulative effects over time that a perturbing force causes in a dynamical system. An index of this type can help to prepare “perturbation maps”, which can identify situations of larger or smaller effects. This idea appeared in the astrodynamics literature with the goal of finding less perturbed orbits for a spacecraft, but it is applied here to the driven harmonic and Duffing oscillators. The reason for those applications is that those problems have analytical solutions, which allows a better comparison of the indices. In particular, the effects of calculating this index using a perturbed and a non-perturbed trajectory are evaluated with the goal of better understanding these effects. The results show that the difference between both indices depends on the frequency and amplitude of the perturbing force.","A. K. de Almeida Jr.1, A. F. B. de Almeida Prado1, R.

By flat at infinity we mean that the growth rate of the volumes of the balls on the manifold is the same as in the flat space. This is true for any manifold for small enough radius, but is in general not true when the radius of the ball grows. So prescribing such a growth rate also at infinity selects a class of manifolds on which our result holds. In this setting estimates are available for the heat kernel and its gradient on the base manifold. From such estimates it is easy to get L p−L q bounds for the heat kernel.

In particular, we prove Hessian comparison theorems (see Theorems 3.1–3.5) and Laplacian comparison theorems (see Theorems 2.6, 2.7 and 3.1–3.5) under varied radial Ricci curvature, radial curvature, Ricci curvature and sectional curvature assumptions, generalizing and extending the work of Han-Li-Ren-Wei (2014) and Wei (2016). We also extend the notion of function or differential form growth to bundle-valued differential form growth of various types and discuss their interrelationship (see Theorem 5.4). These provide tools in extending the notion, integrability and decomposition of generalized harmonic forms to those of bundle-valued generalized harmonic forms, introducing Condition W for bundle-valued differential forms, and proving the duality theorem and the unity theorem, generalizing the work of Andreotti and Vesentini (1965) and Wei (2020).

We prove that the corresponding energy—a degenerate non-convex functional with linear growth—admits a unique minimizer, and that the minimizer is smooth in the bulk and continuously differentiable up to the boundary. We also show that, in contrast with 2-harmonic maps, a range of boundary data exists such that the energy admits more than one smooth critical point: more precisely, we prove that the corresponding Euler–Lagrange equation admits a unique (up to scaling and symmetries) global solution, which turns out to be oscillating, and we characterize the minimizer and the smooth critical points of the energy as the monotone, respectively non-monotone, branches of such solution.","Roberta Dal Passo1, Lorenzo Giacomelli2 & Salvador Moll",Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00526-007-0153-2,"58E20,49J05,49J45,49K05,49K40,49N60,34B16,76A15,82D40,68U10"

In this paper, under suitable restriction on the dilatation of \(f\), we show that the convolutions of \(f_1\) with certain slanted half-plane harmonic mappings \(f\in {\mathcal S^0}(H_{\gamma })\) are necessarily convex in a direction. In addition, we consider a fixed harmonic mapping \(f_0\) and \(f=h+\overline{g}\in {\mathcal S^0}(H_{\gamma })\cup {\mathcal S^0}(\Omega _\alpha )\) with the dilatation \(\omega (z)=az^n\), where \({\mathcal S^0}(\Omega _\alpha )\) denotes the class of asymmetric vertical strip mappings.

1025,0,Sparse Harmonic Transforms: A New Class of Sublinear-Time Algorithms for Learning Functions of Many Variables,"In this paper we develop fast and memory efficient numerical methods for learning functions of many variables that admit sparse representations in terms of general bounded orthonormal tensor product bases. Such functions appear in many applications including, e.g., various Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) problems involving the solution of parametric PDE that are approximately sparse in Chebyshev or Legendre product bases (Chkifa et al. in Polynomial approximation via compressed sensing of high-dimensional functions on lower sets. arXiv:1602.05823, 2016; Rauhut and Schwab in Math Comput 86(304):661–700, 2017). We expect that our results provide a starting point for a new line of research on sublinear-time solution techniques for UQ applications of the type above which will eventually be able to scale to significantly higher-dimensional problems than what are currently computationally feasible. More concretely, let \({\mathcal {B}}\) be a finite Bounded Orthonormal Product Basis (BOPB) of cardinality \(|{\mathcal {B}}| = N\). Herein we will develop methods that rapidly approximate any function f that is sparse in the BOPB, that is, \(f: {\mathcal {D}} \subset {\mathbb {R}}^D \rightarrow {\mathbb {C}}\) of the form $$\begin{aligned} f(\varvec{x}) = \sum _{b \in {\mathcal {S}}} c_b \cdot b(\varvec{x}) \end{aligned}$$with \({\mathcal {S}} \subset {\mathcal {B}}\) of cardinality \(|{\mathcal {S}}| = s \ll N\). Our method adapts the CoSaMP algorithm (Needell and Tropp in Appl Comput Harmon Anal 26(3):301–321, 2009) to use additional function samples from f along a randomly constructed grid \({\mathcal {G}} \subset {\mathbb {R}}^D\) with universal approximation properties in order to rapidly identify the multi-indices of the most dominant basis functions in \({\mathcal {S}}\) component by component during each CoSaMP iteration. It has a runtime of just \((s \log N)^{{\mathcal {O}}(1)}\), uses only \((s \log N)^{{\mathcal {O}}(1)}\) function evaluations on the fixed and nonadaptive grid \({\mathcal {G}}\), and requires not more than \((s \log N)^{{\mathcal {O}}(1)}\) bits of memory. We emphasize that nothing about \({\mathcal {S}}\) or any of the coefficients \(c_b \in {\mathbb {C}}\) is assumed in advance other than that \({\mathcal {S}} \subset {\mathcal {B}}\) has \(|{\mathcal {S}}| \le s\). Both \({\mathcal {S}}\) and its related coefficients \(c_b\) will be learned from the given function evaluations by the developed method. For \(s\ll N\), the runtime \((s \log N)^{{\mathcal {O}}(1)}\) will be less than what is required to simply enumerate the elements of the basis \({\mathcal {B}}\); thus our method is the first approach applicable in a general BOPB framework that falls into the class referred to as sublinear-time. This and the similarly reduced sample and memory requirements set our algorithm apart from previous works based on standard compressive sensing algorithms such as basis pursuit which typically store and utilize full intermediate basis representations of size \(\varOmega (N)\) during the solution process.","Bosu Choi1, Mark A.

Systems of differential equations describing the behavior of Chua’s circuits are three-dimensional autonomous dynamical systems with scalar nonlinearity. In the standard Chua system, chaotic oscillations are excited in the classical manner, namely, starting from the neighborhood of the unstable zero equilibrium, after the transient process, the system trajectory tends to a Chua attractor.In this work, generalized Chua systems (i.e., Chua systems with a locally stable equilibrium) are considered. In such systems, the above mentioned method for detection of attractors fails to work. In 2008 G.A. Leonov suggested an analytical-numerical approach to searching for periodic solutions in autonomous dynamical systems with scalar nonlinearity. This method combines the standard method of harmonic balance, the classical method of small parameter, bifurcation theory, and numerical methods.

In particular we show that their gradient vanishes at all points where the tangent cone is isometric to a cone over a metric measure space with non-maximal diameter. The same analysis is performed for functions with Laplacian in \(L^{N+\varepsilon }\). As a consequence we show that on smooth manifolds there is no a priori estimate on the modulus of continuity of the gradient of harmonic functions which depends only on lower bounds of the sectional curvature. In the same way we show that there is no a priori Calderón–Zygmund theory for the Laplacian with bounds depending only on lower bounds of the sectional curvature.","Guido De Philippis1 & Jesús Núñez-Zimbrón

The nonlinear term \(|E|^{p-2}E\) with \(2<p\leqslant2^*=6\) comes from the nonlinear polarization and the boundary conditions are those for Ω surrounded by a perfect conductor.

First, we transform the hypersingular integral equation into 2π-periodic hypersingular integral equation with the map x = cot(θ/2). Second, we initiate the study of the multiscale Galerkin method for the 2π-periodic hypersingular integral equation. The trigonometric wavelets are used as trial functions. Consequently, the 2j+1 × 2j+1 stiffness matrix K  j  can be partitioned j × j block matrices. Furthermore, these block matrices are zeros except main diagonal block matrices. These main diagonal block matrices are symmetrical and circulant matrices, and hence the solution of the associated linear algebraic system can be solved with the fast Fourier transform and the inverse fast Fourier transform instead of the inverse matrix.

Thus a natural question is: What is the supremum of all β′s , call it β0, for which the above inequality holds for every suchD? Another formulation of the problem involves hyperbolic metric instead of harmonic measure. Using this formulation a lower bound for β0 is found. Upper bounds for β0 can be obtained by constructing examples of domainsD. It is shown that a certain domain whose boundary consists of an infinite number of vertical half-lines, i.e. a comb domain, gives a good upper bound. This bound disproves a conjecture of C.

1082,0,Interpolation and harmonic majorants in big Hardy-Orlicz spaces,"Free interpolation in Hardy spaces is characterized by the well-known Carleson condition. The result extends to Hardy-Orlicz spaces contained in the scale of classical Hardy spaces H p, p > 0. For the Smirnov and the Nevanlinna classes, interpolating sequences have been characterized in a recent paper in terms of the existence of harmonic majorants (quasi-bounded in the case of the Smirnov class). Since the Smirnov class can be regarded as the union over all Hardy-Orlicz spaces associated with a so-called strongly convex function, it is natural to ask how the condition changes from the Carleson condition in classical Hardy spaces to harmonic majorants in the Smirnov class. The aim of this paper is to narrow down this gap from the Smirnov class to “big” Hardy-Orlicz spaces. More precisely, we characterize interpolating sequences for a class of Hardy-Orlicz spaces that carry an algebraic structure and are strictly bigger than ⋃ p>0 H p. It turns out that the interpolating sequences are again characterized by the existence of quasi-bounded majorants, but now the functions defining these quasi-bounded majorants have to be in suitable Orlicz spaces. The existence of harmonic majorants defined by functions in such Orlicz spaces is also discussed in the general situation. We finish the paper with a class of examples of separated Blaschke sequences which are interpolating for certain Hardy-Orlicz spaces without being interpolating for slightly smaller ones.",Andreas Hartmann,Journal d'Analyse Mathématique,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11854-008-0006-8,"Convex Function,Orlicz Space,Interpolation Problem,Blaschke Product,Outer Function"

Given a weak solution of the flow that exists for all time \(t\ge 0\), we find a sequence of times \(t_i\rightarrow \infty \) at which the flow at different scales converges to a collection of branched minimal immersions with no loss of energy. We do this by developing a compactness theory, establishing no loss of energy, for sequences of almost-minimal maps. Moreover, we construct an example of a smooth flow for which the image of the limit branched minimal immersions is disconnected. In general, we show that the necks connecting the images of the branched minimal immersions become arbitrarily thin as \(i\rightarrow \infty \).","Tobias Huxol1, Melanie Rupflin2 & Peter M.

1105,0,The Blow-up Locus of Heat Flows for Harmonic Maps," Let M and N be two compact Riemannian manifolds. Let u  k  (x, t) be a sequence of strong stationary weak heat flows from M×R + to N with bounded energies. Assume that u k→u weakly in H 1, 2(M×R +, N) and that Σt is the blow-up set for a fixed t > 0. In this paper we first prove Σt is an H m−2-rectifiable set for almost all t∈R +. And then we prove two blow-up formulas for the blow-up set and the limiting map. From the formulas, we can see that if the limiting map u is also a strong stationary weak heat flow, Σt is a distance solution of the (m− 2)-dimensional mean curvature flow [1]. If a smooth heat flow blows-up at a finite time, we derive a tangent map or a weakly quasi-harmonic sphere and a blow-up set ∪t<0Σt× {t}. We prove the blow-up map is stationary if and only if the blow-up locus is a Brakke motion.",Jiayu Li1 & Gang Tian,Acta Mathematica Sinica,2000,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s101149900024,"Heat flow,Mean curvature flow,Brakke motion,Blow-up locus"

1110,0,Geometric properties of harmonic mappings in stable Riemannian domains,"H. Kneser (Jahresber Dt Math Vereinigung 35:123–124, 1926) showed by an ingenious method that plane harmonic mappings on the unit disc B, which attribute the circumference \(\partial B\) in a topological way to a convex curve \(\Gamma \), necessarily yield a diffeomorphism of B onto the interior G of the contour \(\Gamma \) and a homeomorphism between their closures. E. Heinz has generalized this method to solutions of nonlinear elliptic systems [see Chap. 13, Sect. 6 of Sauvigny (Partial differential equations. 1. Foundations and integral representations; 2. Functional analytic methods; with consideration of lectures by E. Heinz. Springer, London, 2012], however, this reasoning is restricted to the local situation and requires Lipschitz conditions for certain linear combinations of their coefficient functions. These Lewy-Heinz-systems comprise the equations for harmonic mappings with respect to a Riemannian metric and were utilized by Jost (J Reine Angew Math 342:141–153, 1981) to prove univalency for harmonic mappings between Riemannian surfaces. A global result is achieved by reconstruction of the solution for the Dirichlet problem, since this problem is uniquely determined by the uniqueness result of Jäger and Kaul (Manuscr Math 28:269–291, 1979). Here we shall adapt the original method of H. Kneser for harmonic mappings with respect to Riemannian metrics in order to receive harmonic diffeomorphisms from B onto stable Riemannian domains \(\Omega \). We construct a global nonlinear auxiliary function associated with an embedding into a field of geodesics. In the special case of planar harmonic mappings under semi-free boundary conditions, this procedure already appears in Proposition 3 of Hildebrandt and Sauvigny (J Reine Angew Math 422:69–89, 1991). By our present method to show univalency and to obtain a diffeomorphism between the domains, we can dispense of the uniqueness for the associate Dirichlet problem. The crucial idea consists of the notion stable Riemannian domains \(\Omega \), which possess a family of non-intersecting geodesic rays emanating from each boundary point and furnish a simple covering of the whole domain. Furthermore, we establish a convex hull property for harmonic mappings within \(\Omega \). On the basis of investigations by Hildebrandt et al. (Acta Math 138:1–16, 1977), we construct harmonic embeddings within the hemisphere by direct variational methods.",Friedrich Sauvigny,Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00526-019-1600-6,"35J60,53C21"

Strong blowing of ablated materials from the vehicle surface is taken into account by using a two-layer flow model without allowance for the viscosity and thermal conduction of the gas. The heating and ablation of a multilayered thermal protection system are determined simultaneously with the vehicle’s flight trajectory, which is calculated taking into account the mass loss due to the ablation.

1149,0,Grand p-harmonic energy,"To every nonlinear differential expression there corresponds the so-called natural domain of definition. Usually, such a domain consists of Sobolev functions, sometimes with additional geometric constraints. There are, however, special nonlinear differential expressions (Jacobian determinants, div-curl products, etc.) whose special properties (higher integrability, weak-continuity, etc.) cannot be detected within their natural domain. We must consider them in a slightly larger class of functions. The grand Lebesgue space, denoted by \(\mathscr {L}^{p})(\mathbb X)\), and the corresponding grand Sobolev space \(\mathscr {W}^{1,p})(\mathbb X)\), turn out to be most effective. They were studied by many authors, largely in analogy with the questions concerning \(\mathscr {L}^p (\mathbb X)\) and \(\mathscr {W}^{1,p}(\mathbb X)\) spaces. The present paper is a continuation of these studies. We take on stage the grand p-harmonic energy integrals. These variational functionals involve both one-parameter family of integral averages and supremum with respect to the parameter. It is for this reason that the existence and uniqueness of the grand p-harmonic minimal mappings becomes a new (rather challenging) problem.",Teresa Radice,Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00526-016-1101-9,"Primary 35A30,Secondary 35B65"

Indeed, it is hard to take advantage of high-order polynomials given that the right-hand side only exhibits \(L^2\) regularity.

Key components are the newly developed conformal mapping methods, wave splitting, Fourier series expansions in eigenfunctions to non-normal operators, the building block method or the cascade technique, Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators, and reformulation in terms of stable differential equations for reflection and transmission matrices. For an example, the results show good correspondence with a finite element method solution to the same problem in the low- and medium-frequency domains. The Fourier method complements finite element analysis as a waveguide simulation tool. For inverse engineering involving tuning of straight waveguide parts joining complicated waveguide elements, the Fourier method is an attractive alternative including time aspects. The prime motivation for the Fourier method is its added physical understanding primarily at low frequencies.","Anders Andersson1, Börje Nilsson2 & Thomas Biro",Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-015-9808-8,"Building Block Method,Conformal mappings ,Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators,Fourier series,Harmonic scalar waves,Normal surface admittance"

A one-dimensional non-local kernel was used to replace a twodimensional one for the dynamic problem to obtain the stress occurring at the crack tips. The Fourier transform was applied and a mixed boundary value problem was formulated. Then a set of triple integral equations was solved by using Schmidt's method. This method is more exact and more reasonable than Eringe's for solving this problem. Contrary to the classical elasticity solution, it is found that no stress singularity is present at the crack tip. The non-local dynamic elastic solutions yield a finite hoop stress at the crack tip, thus allowing for a fracture criterion based on the maximum dynamic stress hypothesis.

For \(\alpha >1\), the latter are known to satisfy a Palais–Smale condition, and so, the technique of Sacks–Uhlenbeck consists in constructing \(\alpha \)-harmonic maps for \(\alpha >1\) and then letting \(\alpha \rightarrow 1\). The extension of this scheme to Dirac-harmonic maps meets with several difficulties, and in this paper, we start attacking those. We first prove the existence of nontrivial perturbed \(\alpha \)-Dirac-harmonic maps when the target manifold has nonpositive curvature. The regularity theorem then shows that they are actually smooth if the perturbation function is smooth. By \(\varepsilon \)-regularity and suitable perturbations, we can then show that such a sequence of perturbed \(\alpha \)-Dirac-harmonic maps converges to a smooth coupled \(\alpha \)-Dirac-harmonic map.",Jürgen Jost1 & Jingyong Zhu,Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00526-021-01955-1,"58E05,58E20"

Concerning the simplicity of such formulas an important subtask is to decide if the arising sums satisfy algebraic relations among each other. Interesting enough, algebraic relations of such formal sums can be derived from combinatorial quasi-shuffle algebras. We will focus on the following question: can one find more relations if one evaluates these sums to sequences and looks for relations within the ring of sequences. In this article we consider the sequences of the rather general class of (cyclotomic) harmonic sums and show that their relations coincide with the relations found by their underlying quasi-shuffle algebra. In order to derive this result, we utilize the quasi-shuffle algebra and construct a difference ring with the following property: (1) the generators of the difference ring represent (cyclotomic) harmonic sums, (2) they generate within the ring all (cyclotomic) harmonic sums, and (3) the sequences produced by the generators are algebraically independent among each other. This means that their sequences do not satisfy any polynomial relations. The proof of this latter property is obtained by difference ring theory and new symbolic summation results. As a consequence, any sequence produced by (cyclotomic) harmonic sums can be formulated within our difference ring in an optimal way: there does not exist a subset of the arising sums in which the sequence can be formulated as polynomial expression.",Jakob Ablinger1 & Carsten Schneider,Annals of Combinatorics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00026-018-0381-5,"33F10,68W30,11K31"

Using some analogs of classical tools, such as Almgren’s frequency function, they focus on harmonic maps into F-connected complexes, and demonstrate that the singular sets of such functions are closed and of codimension 2. More recent work on related problems, such as Naber and Valtorta’s (Ann Math 185(1):131–227, 2017), uses the study of monotone quantities such as the frequency function to prove stronger rectifiability results about the singular sets in these contexts. In this paper, we adapt this more recent work to demonstrate that an energy-minimizing map from a Euclidean space \({\mathbb {R}}^m\) to an F-connected complex has a singular set which is \((m-2)\)-rectifiable. We also obtain Minkowski bounds on the singular sets of these maps, and in particular, use these bounds to demonstrate the local finiteness of the \((m-2)\)-dimensional Hausdorff measure of these singular sets.","Ben K.

1255,0,Sigma Delta Quantization with Harmonic Frames and Partial Fourier Ensembles,"Sigma Delta (\(\Sigma \Delta \)) quantization, a quantization method first surfaced in the 1960s, has now been widely adopted in various digital products such as cameras, cell phones, radars, etc. The method features a great robustness with respect to quantization noises through sampling an input signal at a Super-Nyquist rate. Compressed sensing (CS) is a frugal acquisition method that utilizes the sparsity structure of an objective signal to reduce the number of samples required for a lossless acquisition. By deeming this reduced number as an effective dimensionality of the set of sparse signals, one can define a relative oversampling/subsampling rate as the ratio between the actual sampling rate and the effective dimensionality. When recording these “compressed” analog measurements via Sigma Delta quantization, a natural question arises: will the signal reconstruction error previously shown to decay polynomially as the increase of the vanilla oversampling rate for the case of band-limited functions, now be decaying polynomially as that of the relative oversampling rate? Answering this question is one of the main goals in this direction. The study of quantization in CS has so far been limited to proving error convergence results for Gaussian and sub-Gaussian sensing matrices, as the number of bits and/or the number of samples grow to infinity. In this paper, we provide a first result for the more realistic Fourier sensing matrices. The main idea is to randomly permute the Fourier samples before feeding them into the quantizer. We show that the random permutation can effectively increase the low frequency power of the measurements, thus enhance the quality of \(\Sigma \Delta \) quantization.",Rongrong Wang,Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00041-017-9582-2,"Compressed sensing,Sigma delta quantization,Partial fourier matrix"

Our method is based on the recently proposed numerically stable iterative rational approximation algorithm in Nakatsukasa et al. (SIAM J Sci Comput 40(3):A1494–A1522, 2018). For signal reconstruction we use a set of classical Fourier coefficients of f with regard to a fixed interval (0, P) with \(P>0\). Even though all terms of f may be non-P-periodic, our reconstruction method requires at most \(2K+2\) Fourier coefficients \(c_{n}(f)\) to recover all parameters of f. We show that in the case of exact data, the proposed iterative algorithm terminates after at most \(K+1\) steps. The algorithm can also detect the number K of terms of f, if K is a priori unknown and \(L \ge 2K+2\) Fourier coefficients are available. Therefore our method provides a new alternative to the known numerical approaches for the recovery of exponential sums that are based on Prony’s method.","Markus Petz1, Gerlind Plonka

All code is made publicly available. As part of the proof of the main recovery guarantee new variants of the well known CoSaMP algorithm are proposed which can utilize any sufficiently accurate support identification procedure satisfying a Support Identification Property (SIP) in order to obtain strong sparse approximation guarantees. These new CoSaMP variants are then proven to have both runtime and recovery error behavior which are largely determined by the associated runtime and error behavior of the chosen support identification method. The main theoretical results of the paper are then shown by developing a sublinear-time support identification algorithm for general BOPB sets which is robust to arbitrary additive errors. Using this new support identification method to create a new CoSaMP variant then results in a new robust sublinear-time compressive sensing algorithm for BOPB-compressible functions of many variables.","Bosu Choi1, Mark Iwen2,3 & Toni Volkmer",Numerische Mathematik,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-021-01200-z,"High-dimensional function approximation,Sublinear-time algorithms,Function learning,Sparse approximation,Compressive Sensing,Sparse Fourier transforms (SFT)"

The benefit to introduce a time-dependent parameter \(\lambda ^{1-\kappa }\) is readily to see $$\begin{aligned} \int _{Q} \lambda ^{1-\kappa } ( | u_\lambda |^2 \, - \, 1 )^2 \, \mathrm{d}t \mathrm{d}x \; \le \; \frac{C}{\log \lambda } \end{aligned}$$for some positive constant C independent of \(\lambda \). Next, making the best of it, we prove that a passing to the limits \(\lambda \nearrow \infty \) ( modulo sub-sequence of \(\lambda \) ) brings the existence of a harmonic heat flow into spheres with (i) a global energy inequality, (ii) a monotonicity for the scaled energy, (iii) a reverse Poincaré inequality. These inequalities (i), (ii) and (iii) improve the estimates on its singular set of a harmonic heat flow by Chen and Struwe (Math Z 201(1):83–103, 1989), i.e. I show that a singular set of the new harmonic heat flows into spheres has at most finite \((d-\epsilon _0)\)-dimensional Hausdorff measure with respect to the parabolic metric whereupon \(\epsilon _0\) is a small positive number. We finally prove that if the harmonic heat flows is a constant at the boundary, then \(u_\lambda (t)\) strongly converges to the constant \(t \nearrow \infty \) in \(H^{1,2} ({\mathbb {B}}^d;{\mathbb {S}}^{D+1})\). We call this the parabolic constancy theorem. We restrict ourselves a harmonic heat flow from the unit ball into a sphere to avoid confusion of notation. But it is readily seen that our results can be extended to it between compact Riemannian manifolds using a distance function combined with Nash’s imbedding theorem.","Kazuhiro Horihata

1294,0,Convolutions of Normalized Harmonic Mappings,"Recent results on the convolution of two planar harmonic mappings is built upon the theory that when the convolution of functions from certain families of mappings, such as half-plane or strip mappings, is locally univalent, then the convolution will possess certain direction-convexity properties. Thus, much of the latest work on harmonic convolutions centers around establishing conditions on the dilatations of \(f_1, f_2: {\mathbb D}\rightarrow {\mathbb C}\) from the families above so that \(f_1 * f_2\) is locally univalent. Recently, it was noted that normalizations for these families were not treated properly when some dilatations considered did not fix zero. In this paper, we account for a variety of dilatations that do not fix zero by broadening the family from which \(f_1\) and \(f_2\) are chosen. Additionally, we show that when removing a hypothesis from one of our results it is possible to have a locally univalent convolution that fails to be univalent.

The liquid compression pulse duration is equal to the period of the natural oscillations of the cluster. All bubbles are assumed to remain only weakly nonspherical during the response. The cluster is formed by bubbles with the centers at the nodes of a cubic mesh (one of which is located at the cluster center). The influence of the bubble-bubble interaction, the forcing pulse amplitude, the bubble position and the number of bubbles in the cluster is investigated. The effect of the interaction between bubbles is estimated by comparison with the dynamics of a single bubble under the same conditions. The dynamics of bubbles in the cluster is governed by the second-order ODEs in the radii of the bubbles, the position-vectors of their centers and the amplitudes of their non-sphericity in the form of spherical harmonics. It has been found that the maximum values of the number of bubbles in the cluster and the pulse amplitude under the condition that all bubbles during the response remain only weakly non-spherical, are about 81 and 0.16 times the liquid pressure, respectively. The maximum pressure attained in the cluster bubbles during the response in the corresponding ranges of the pulse amplitude and the number of bubbles in cluster is only about 33\(\%\) higher than their initial pressure.",I.

We extend this result to a class of Lipschitz domains in \({\mathbb {R}}^{n+1}\). In particular, we obtain the local version of this LIL for the upper halfspace. The proof is based on approximation of the weighted averages by a Bloch function, satisfying some additional condition determined by the weight w. The growth rate of such Bloch function depends on w and, for slowly increasing w, turns out to be slower than the one provided by LILs of Makarov and Llorente. We discuss the necessary condition for an arbitrary Bloch function to exhibit this type of behaviour.","P. Mozolyako

1367,0,Minimizing Aliasing in Multiple Frequency Harmonic Balance Computations,"The harmonic balance method has emerged as an efficient and accurate approach for computing periodic, as well as almost periodic, solutions to nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The accuracy of the harmonic balance method can however be negatively impacted by aliasing. Aliasing occurs because Fourier coefficients of nonlinear terms in the governing equations are approximated by a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Understanding how aliasing occurs when the DFT is applied is therefore essential in improving the accuracy of the harmonic balance method. In this work, a new operator that describe the fold-back, i.e. aliasing, of unresolved frequencies onto the resolved ones is developed. The norm of this operator is then used as a metric for investigating how the time sampling should be performed to minimize aliasing. It is found that a time sampling which minimizes the condition number of the DFT matrix is the best choice in this regard, both for single and multiple frequency problems. These findings are also verified for the Duffing oscillator. Finally, a strategy for oversampling multiple frequency harmonic balance computations is developed and tested. ","Daniel Lindblad

In Part II we analyze the propagation of a sequence of subpulses in an optical fiber without self-interaction characterized by cubic nonlinearity and large wavenumber detuning between the principal mode and the second harmonic. The propagation regimes discovered for a sequence of femtosecond pulses ensure suppression of peak intensity fluctuations. The mean peak intensity can be simultaneously increased by chirping the pulses in a particular section and also by adjusting the wavenumber detuning and increasing the quadratic nonlinearity while at the same time reducing to zero the phase of the distribution when the pulses pass to a new part of the nonlinear system.,T.

Here \(\rho \) is a radial metric defined in the image annulus. The key element in the proofs is the solution to the Euler–Lagrange equation for a radial harmonic mapping. This is a new contribution on the topic related to the famous J. C. C. Nitsche conjecture on harmonic mappings between annuli on the complex plane. Namely we prove that the minimum of \((\rho ,n)\)-energy of diffeomorphisms between annuli is attained by a certain \((\rho ,n)\)-harmonic diffeomorphisms if and only if the original annulus can be mapped onto the image annulus by a radial \((\rho ,n)\)-harmonic diffeomorphisms and the last fact is equivalent with a certain inequality for annuli which we call a generalized J.

\({\mathrm {H}}\)-Harmonic Maaß-Jacobi forms of degree 1","It was shown in previous work that the one-variable \(\widehat{\mu }\)- function defined by Zwegers (and Zagier) and his indefinite theta series attached to lattices of signature \((r\!+\!1,1)\) are both Heisenberg harmonic Maaß-Jacobi forms. We extend the concept of Heisenberg harmonicity to Maaß-Jacobi forms of arbitrary many elliptic variables, and produce indefinite theta series of “product type” for non-degenerate lattices of signature \((r\!+\!s,s)\). We thus obtain a clean generalization of \(\widehat{\mu }\) to these negative definite lattices. From restrictions to torsion points of Heisenberg harmonic Maaß-Jacobi forms, we obtain harmonic weak Maaß forms of higher depth in the sense of Zagier and Zwegers. In particular, we explain the modular completion of some, so-called degenerate indefinite theta series in the context of higher depth mixed mock modular forms. The structure theory for Heisenberg harmonic Maaß-Jacobi forms developed in this paper also explains a curious splitting of Zwegers’s two-variable \(\widehat{\mu }\)-function into the sum of a meromorphic Jacobi form and a one-variable Maaß-Jacobi form.","Martin Westerholt-Raum
