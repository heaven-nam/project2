0,Blow-up analysis for approximate Dirac-harmonic maps in dimension 2 with applications to the Dirac-harmonic heat flow,"Dirac-harmonic maps couple a second order harmonic map type system with a first nonlinear Dirac equation. We consider approximate Dirac-harmonic maps \(\{(\phi _n,\psi _n)\}\), that is, maps that satisfy the Dirac-harmonic system up to controlled error terms. We show that such approximate Dirac-harmonic maps defined on a Riemann surface, that is, in dimension 2, continue to satisfy the basic properties of blow-up analysis like the energy identity and the no neck property. The assumptions are such that they hold for solutions of the heat flow of Dirac-harmonic maps. That flow turns the harmonic map type system into a parabolic system, but simply keeps the Dirac equation as a nonlinear first order constraint along the flow. As a corollary of the main result of this paper, when such a flow blows up at infinite time at interior points, we obtain an energy identity and the no neck property.","Jürgen Jost1, Lei Liu1 & Miaomiao Zhu",Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00526-017-1202-0,53C43 (58E20)

0,Harmonic analysis on the infinite-dimensional unitary group,"The goal of harmonic analysis on the infinite-dimensional unitary group is to decompose a certain family of unitary representations of this group, which is a substitute for the nonexisting regular representations and depends on two complex parameters (Olshanski, 2003). In the case of noninteger parameters, the decomposing measure is described in terms of determinantal point processes (Borondin and Olshanski, 2005). The aim of the present paper is to describe the decomposition for integer parameters; in this case, the spectrum of the decompositions changes drastically. A similar result was earlier obtained for the infinite symmetric group (Kerov, Olshanski, and Vershik, 2004), but the case of the unitary group turned out to be much more complicated.

Unfortunately, the traditional Melnikov methods strongly depend on small parameters, which do not exist in most practical systems. Those methods are limited in dealing with the systems with strong nonlinearities. This paper presents a procedure to study the chaos and sub-harmonic resonance of strongly nonlinear practical systems by employing a homotopy method that is used to extend the Melnikov functions to the strongly nonlinear systems. Applied to a given example, the procedure shows the effectiveness via the comparison of the theoretical results and the numerical simulation.","Yan-bin Liu

 denote N independent d-dimensional Lévy processes, and consider the N-parameter random field

This improves our earlier joint effort with Yuquan Zhong by removing a certain condition of symmetry in Khoshnevisan et al. (Ann Probab 31(2):1097–1141, 2003). Moreover, we show that under mild regularity conditions, our necessary and sufficient condition can be recast in terms of one-potential densities. This rests on developing results in classical (non-probabilistic) harmonic analysis that might be of independent interest. As was shown in Khoshnevisan et al.

0,New matrix method for response analysis of circumferentially stiffened non-circular cylindrical shells under harmonic pressure,"Based on the governing equation of vibration of a kind of cylindrical shells written in a matrix differential equation of the first order, a new matrix method is presented for steady-state vibration analysis of a noncircular cylindrical shell simply supported at two ends and circumferentially stiffened by rings under harmonic pressure. Its difference from the existing works by Yamada and Irie is that the matrix differential equation is solved by using the extended homogeneous capacity precision integration approach other than the Runge-Kutta-Gill integration method. The transfer matrix can easily be determined by a high precision integration scheme. In addition, besides the normal interacting forces, which were commonly adopted by researchers earlier, the tangential interacting forces between the cylindrical shell and the rings are considered at the same time by means of the Dirac-δ function. The effects of the exciting frequencies on displacements and stresses responses have been investigated. Numerical results show that the proposed method is more efficient than the aforementioned method.","Zou Shi-zhi

0,Analysis of biochemical phase shift oscillators by a harmonic balancing technique,"The use of harmonic balancing techniques for theoretically investigating a large class of biochemical phase shift oscillators is outlined and the accuracy of this approximate technique for large dimension nonlinear chemical systems is considered. It is concluded that for the equations under study these techniques can be successfully employed to both find periodic solutions and to indicate those cases which can not oscillate. The technique is a general one and it is possible to state a step by step procedure for its application. It has a substantial advantage in producing results which are immediately valid for arbitrary dimension. As the accuracy of the method increases with dimension, it complements classical small dimension methods.The results obtained by harmonic balancing analysis are compared with those obtained by studying the local stability properties of the singular points of the differential equation. A general theorem is derived which identifies those special cases where the results of first order harmonic balancing are identical to those of local stability analysis, and a necessary condition for this equivalence is derived. As a concrete example, the n-dimensional Goodwin oscillator is considered where ϱ, the Hill coefficient of the feedback metabolite, is equal to three and four. It is shown that for ϱ =3 or 4 and n≤4 the approximation indicates that it is impossible to construct a set of physically permissible reaction constants such that the system possesses a periodic solution. However for n≥5 it is always possible to find a large domain in the reaction constant space giving stable oscillations. A means of constructing such a parameter set is given. The results obtained here are compared with previously derived results for ϱ=1 and ϱ=2.", P.

The subjects of the lectures were, briefly, as follows:


1.
Fourier series, 1900-1950.


2.
Singular integrals (part I).


3.
Hp, BMO, and singular integrals (part II).


4.
Littlewood-Paley theory: the history of a technique.


5.
Harmonic analysis on groups.


6.
Wavelets.


I emphasized interconnections, both the way in which the material in the first lecture provided the roots out of which most of the developments in the other lectures grew, and the ways in which those developments interacted with each other. I included sketches of as many proofs as the time would permit: some very brief, but some fairly complete, especially those whose methodology is an important part of the subject. Much was omitted, of course, and there was a natural bias toward the areas where I have spent periods of my own mathematical life. Many developments, particularly those of the final quarter-century, received at most a brief mention.This paper is a written account of these lectures with a few more details fleshed out, a few topics reorganized, and a few items added. I hope that others may find it an interesting narrative and a useful reference, and that it may lead some of them to share my enjoyment of exploring the original sources. I have tried to provide the references to those sources wherever possible, and for the more recent developments I also provide references to various expository works as the occasion arises. For the pre-1950 results discussed here and their proofs, however, there is one canonical reference, which I give here once and for all: Antoni Zygmund’s treatise [96].

Then,SL(2, ℂ)-harmonic analysis, in the noncompact picture of induced representations, is used to decompose patterns into the components invariant under irreducible representations of the principal series ofSL(2, ℂ). Usefulness in digital image processing problems is studied by providing a camera model in which the action ofSL(2, ℂ) on the complex image plane corresponds to, and exhausts, planar central projections as produced when aerial images of the same scene are taken from different vantage points.

On a uniform rectangular prism mesh, superclose property is achieved for electric field E and magnetic filed H with the boundary condition E×n=0 by means of the asymptotic expansion. Applying postprocessing operators, a superconvergence result is stated for the discretization error of the postprocessed discrete solution to the solution itself.

The physical origin of these problems is explained, and then the mathematical models are developed. Three notions emerge as central to the programme: positive operator-valued (POV) measures on a Hilbert space, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and fibre bundle formulations of quantum geometries. A close connection between the first two notions is shown to exist, which provides a natural setting for introducing a fibration on the associated overcomplete family of vectors. The introduction of group covariance leads to an extended version of harmonic analysis on phase space. It also yields a theory of induced group representations, which extends the results of Mackey on imprimitivity systems for locally compact groups to the more general case of systems of covariance. Quantum geometries emerge as fibre bundles whose base spaces are manifolds of mean stochastic locations for quantum test particles (i.e., spacetime excitons) that display a phase space structure, and whose fibres and structure groups contain, respectively, the aforementioned overcomplete families of vectors and unitary group representations of phase space systems of covariance.",S.

0,Harmonic analysis on the infinite symmetric group,"The infinite symmetric group S(∞), whose elements are finite permutations of {1,2,3,...}, is a model example of a “big” group. By virtue of an old result of Murray–von Neumann, the one–sided regular representation of S(∞) in the Hilbert space ℓ2(S(∞)) generates a type II1 von Neumann factor while the two–sided regular representation is irreducible. This shows that the conventional scheme of harmonic analysis is not applicable to S(∞): for the former representation, decomposition into irreducibles is highly non–unique, and for the latter representation, there is no need of any decomposition at all. We start with constructing a compactification \(\mathfrak{S}\supset{S(\infty)}\), which we call the space of virtual permutations. Although \(\mathfrak{S}\) is no longer a group, it still admits a natural two–sided action of S(∞). Thus, \(\mathfrak{S}\) is a G–space, where G stands for the product of two copies of S(∞). On \(\mathfrak{S}\), there exists a unique G-invariant probability measure μ1, which has to be viewed as a “true” Haar measure for S(∞). More generally, we include μ1 into a family {μ
t
: t>0} of distinguished G-quasiinvariant probability measures on virtual permutations. By making use of these measures, we construct a family {T
z
: z∈ℂ} of unitary representations of G,
called generalized regular representations (each representation T
z
 with z≠=0 can be realized in the Hilbert space \(L^2(\mathfrak{S}, \mu_t)\), where t=|z|2). As |z|→∞, the generalized regular representations T
z
 approach, in a suitable sense, the “naive” two–sided regular representation of the group G in the space ℓ2(S(∞)). In contrast with the latter representation, the generalized regular representations T
z
 are highly reducible and have a rich structure. We prove that any T
z
 admits a (unique) decomposition into a multiplicity free continuous integral of irreducible representations of G. For any two distinct (and not conjugate) complex numbers z1, z2, the spectral types of the representations \(T_{z_1}\) and \(T_{z_2}\) are shown to be disjoint. In the case z∈ℤ, a complete description of the spectral type is obtained. Further work on the case z∈ℂ∖ℤ reveals a remarkable link with stochastic point processes and random matrix theory.

For p > 2, we prove that if no affine tangent plane to S passes through the origin and S is analytic, then the associated maximal operator is bounded on \( {L^p}\left( {{\mathbb{R}^3}} \right) \) if and only if p > h(S), where h(S) denotes the so-called height of the surface S (defined in terms of certain Newton diagrams). For non-analytic S we obtain the same statement with the exception of the exponent p = h(S). Our notion of height h(S) is closely related to A. N. Varchenko’s notion of height h(ϕ) for functions ϕ such that S can be locally represented as the graph of ϕ after a rotation of coordinates.Several consequences of this result are discussed.

0,Discrete Harmonic Analysis Associated with Jacobi Expansions II: the Riesz Transform,"The present work is the continuation of our study (Arenas et al. J. Math. Anal. Appl. 490(123996), 21, 2020) on discrete harmonic analysis related to Jacobi expansions. The role of a Laplacian is played by the operator \(\mathcal {J}^{(\alpha ,\beta )}\) defined by the three-term recurrence relation for the normalised Jacobi polynomials. The main interest is to establish weighted inequalities for the Riesz transform associated with \(\mathcal {J}^{(\alpha ,\beta )}\). We make use of an appropriate discrete vector-valued local Calderón-Zygmund theory.","Alberto Arenas

0,Layer-element analysis of multilayered saturated soils subject to axisymmetric vertical time-harmonic excitation,"The analytical layer-elements for a single poroelastic soil layer and the underlying half-space are established using an algebraic manipulation and Hankel transform. According to the boundary conditions and adjacent continuity conditions of general stresses and displacements, a global matrix equation in the transform domain for multilayered saturated soil media is assembled and solved. Solutions in the frequency domain can be further obtained with an inverse Hankel transform. Numerical examples are used to examine accuracy of the present method and demonstrate effects of soil parameters and load conditions on dynamic responses of the multilayered poroelastic saturated soils.",Zhiyong Ai1 & Lihua Wang,Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-017-2241-8,"multilayered saturated soil,axisymmetric vertical excitation,steady state dynamic response,analytical layer-element method"

 of the infinite-dimensional unitary group. These representations are a natural generalization of the regular representation to the “big” group U(∞). They were introduced and studied by G. Olshanski and A. Borodin. The disjointness of these representations reduces to that of certain probability measures on the space of paths in the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph. We prove the latter disjointness using probabilistic and combinatorial methods.",V. E.

This domain can be viewed as a solvable extensionS =NA ofN endowed with a natural left-invariant Riemannian metric. We prove that the functions onS that depend only on the distance from the identity form a commutative convolution algebra. This makesS an example of a harmonic manifold, not necessarily symmetric. In order to study this convolution algebra, we introduce the notion of “averaging projector” and of the corresponding spherical functions in a more general context.

0,Remarks on ‘Norm Estimates of the Partial Derivatives for Harmonic Mappings and Harmonic Quasiregular Mappings’,"Let \(f = P[F]\) denote the Poisson integral of F in the unit disk \({\mathbb {D}}\) with F being absolutely continuous in the unit circle \({\mathbb {T}}\) and \({\dot{F}}\in L^{p}({\mathbb {T}})\), where \({\dot{F}}(e^{it})=\frac{d}{dt} F(e^{it})\) and \(p\ge 1\). Recently, the author in Zhu (J Geom Anal, 2020) proved that (1) if f is a harmonic mapping and \(1\le p< 2\), then \(f_{z}\) and \(\overline{f_{{\overline{z}}}}\in \mathcal {B}^{p}({\mathbb {D}}),\) the classical Bergman spaces of \({\mathbb {D}}\) [12, Theorem 1.2]; (2) if f is a harmonic quasiregular mapping and \(1\le p\le \infty \), then \(f_{z},\) \(\overline{f_{{\overline{z}}}}\in \mathcal {H}^{p}({\mathbb {D}}),\) the classical Hardy spaces of \({\mathbb {D}}\) [12, Theorem 1.3]. These are the main results in Zhu (J Geom Anal, 2020). The purpose of this paper is to generalize these two results. First, we prove that, under the same assumptions, [12, Theorem 1.2] is true when \(1\le p< \infty \). Also, we show that [12, Theorem 1.2] is not true when \(p=\infty \). Second, we demonstrate that [12, Theorem 1.3] still holds true when the assumption f being a harmonic quasiregular mapping is replaced by the weaker one f being a harmonic elliptic mapping.","Shaolin Chen1,2, Saminathan Ponnusamy
