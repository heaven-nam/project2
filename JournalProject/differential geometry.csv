22,"Abstract Differential Geometry, Differential Algebras of Generalized Functions, and de Rham Cohomology","Abstract differential geometry is a recent extension of classical differential geometry on smooth manifolds which, however, does no longer use any notion of Calculus. Instead of smooth functions, one starts with a sheaf of algebras, i.e., the structure sheaf, considered on an arbitrary topological space, which is the base space of all the sheaves subsequently involved. Further, one deals with a sequence of sheaves of modules, interrelated with appropriate ‘differentials’, i.e., suitable ‘Leibniz’ sheaf morphisms, which will constitute the ‘differential complex’. This abstract approach captures much of the essence of classical differential geometry, since it places a powerful apparatus at our disposal which can reproduce and, therefore, extend fundamental classical results. The aim of this paper is to give an indication of the extent to which this apparatus can go beyond the classical framework by including the largest class of singularities dealt with so far. Thus, it is shown that, instead of the classical structure sheaf of algebras of smooth functions, one can start with a significantly larger, and nonsmooth, sheaf of so-called nowhere dense differential algebras of generalized functions. These latter algebras, which contain the Schwartz distributions, also provide global solutions for arbitrary analytic nonlinear PDEs. Moreover, unlike the distributions, and as a matter of physical interest, these algebras can deal with the vastly larger class of singularities which are concentrated on arbitrary closed, nowhere dense subsets and, hence, can have an arbitrary large positive Lebesgue measure. Within the abstract differential geometric context, it is shown that, starting with these nowhere dense differential algebras as a structure sheaf, one can recapture the exactness of the corresponding de Rham complex, and also obtain the short exponential sequence. These results are the two fundamental ingredients in developing differential geometry along classical, as well as abstract lines. Although the commutative framework is used here, one can easily deal with a class of singularities which is far larger than any other one dealt with so far, including in noncommutative theories.",Anastasios Mallios1 & Elemér E.

24,Metrics in Projective Differential Geometry: The Geometry of Solutions to the Metrizability Equation,"Pseudo-Riemannian metrics with Levi-Civita connection in the projective class of a given torsion-free affine connection are equivalent to the maximal rank solutions of a certain overdetermined projectively invariant differential equation often called the metrizability equation. Dropping this rank assumption, we study the solutions to this equation, given less restrictive generic conditions on its prolonged system. In this setting, we find that the solution stratifies the manifold according to the strict signature (pointwise) of the solution and does this in way that locally generalizes the stratification of a model, where the model is, in each case, a corresponding Lie group orbit decomposition of the sphere. Thus the solutions give curved generalizations of such embedded orbit structures. We describe the smooth nature of the strata and determine the geometries of each of the different strata types; this includes a metric on the open strata that becomes singular at the strata boundary, with the latter a type of projective infinity for the given metric. The work also provides new results for the projective compactification of scalar-flat metrics.","Keegan Flood1 & A. Rod Gover

27,Differential operators and BV structures in noncommutative geometry,"We introduce a new formalism of differential operators for a general associative algebra A. It replaces Grothendieck’s notion of differential operators on a commutative algebra in such a way that derivations of the commutative algebra are replaced by \({\mathbb{D}{\rm er}(A)}\), the bimodule of double derivations. Our differential operators act not on the algebra A itself but rather on \({\mathcal{F}(A)}\), a certain ‘Fock space’ associated to any noncommutative algebra A in a functorial way. The corresponding algebra \({\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F}(A))}\) of differential operators is filtered and gr \({\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F}(A))}\), the associated graded algebra, is commutative in some ‘wheeled’ sense. The resulting ‘wheeled’ Poisson structure on gr \({\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F}(A))}\) is closely related to the double Poisson structure on \({T_{A} \mathbb{D}{\rm er}(A)}\) introduced by Van den Bergh. Specifically, we prove that gr \({\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F}(A))\cong\mathcal{F}(T_{A}(\mathbb{D}{\rm er}(A)),}\) provided the algebra A is smooth. Our construction is based on replacing vector spaces by the new symmetric monoidal category of wheelspaces. The Fock space \({\mathcal{F}(A)}\) is a commutative algebra in this category (a “commutative wheelgebra”) which is a structure closely related to the notion of wheeled PROP. Similarly, we have Lie, Poisson, etc., wheelgebras. In this language, \({\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F}(A))}\) becomes the universal enveloping wheelgebra of a Lie wheelgebroid of double derivations. In the second part of the paper, we show, extending a classical construction of Koszul to the noncommutative setting, that any Ricci-flat, torsion-free bimodule connection on \({\mathbb{D}{\rm er}(A)}\) gives rise to a second-order (wheeled) differential operator, a noncommutative analogue of the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) operator, that makes \({\mathcal{F}(T_{A}(\mathbb{D}{\rm er}(A)))}\) a BV wheelgebra. In the final section, we explain how the wheeled differential operators \({\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F}(A))}\) produce ordinary differential operators on the varieties of n-dimensional representations of A for all n ≥ 1.",Victor Ginzburg1 & Travis Schedler,Selecta Mathematica,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00029-010-0029-8,"Primary 16W99,Secondary 16S32"

32,The study of combined action of agents using differential geometry of dose-effect surfaces,"Although graphic surfaces have been used routinely in the study of combined action of agents, they are mainly used for display purposes. In this paper, it is shown that useful mechanistic information can be obtained from an analytical study of these surfaces using the tools of differential geometry. From the analysis of some simple dose-effect surfaces, it is proposed that the intrinsic curvature, referred to in differential geometry as the Gaussian curvature, of a dose-effect surface can be used as a general criterion for the classification of interaction between different agents. This is analogous to the interpretation of the line curvature of a dose-effect curve as an indication of self-interaction between doses for an agent. In this framework, the dose-effect surface would have basic uniform fabric with zero curvature in the absence of interaction, tentatively referred to as null-interaction. Pictorially speaking, this fabric is distorted locally or globally like the stretching and shrinking of a rubber sheet by the presence of interaction mechanisms between different agents. Since self-interaction with dilution dummies does not generate intrinsic curvature, this criterion of null-interaction would describe the interaction between two trulydifferent agents. It is shown that many of the published interaction mechanisms give rise to dose-effect surfaces with characteristic curvatures. This possible correlation between the intrinsic geometric curvature of dose-effect surfaces and the biophysical mechanism of interaction presents an interesting philosophical viewpoint for the study of combined action of agents.",Gabriel K.

39,Differential Geometry Based Multiscale Models,"Large chemical and biological systems such as fuel cells, ion channels, molecular motors, and viruses are of great importance to the scientific community and public health. Typically, these complex systems in conjunction with their aquatic environment pose a fabulous challenge to theoretical description, simulation, and prediction. In this work, we propose a differential geometry based multiscale paradigm to model complex macromolecular systems, and to put macroscopic and microscopic descriptions on an equal footing. In our approach, the differential geometry theory of surfaces and geometric measure theory are employed as a natural means to couple the macroscopic continuum mechanical description of the aquatic environment with the microscopic discrete atomistic description of the macromolecule. Multiscale free energy functionals, or multiscale action functionals are constructed as a unified framework to derive the governing equations for the dynamics of different scales and different descriptions. Two types of aqueous macromolecular complexes, ones that are near equilibrium and others that are far from equilibrium, are considered in our formulations. We show that generalized Navier–Stokes equations for the fluid dynamics, generalized Poisson equations or generalized Poisson–Boltzmann equations for electrostatic interactions, and Newton’s equation for the molecular dynamics can be derived by the least action principle. These equations are coupled through the continuum-discrete interface whose dynamics is governed by potential driven geometric flows. Comparison is given to classical descriptions of the fluid and electrostatic interactions without geometric flow based micro-macro interfaces. The detailed balance of forces is emphasized in the present work. We further extend the proposed multiscale paradigm to micro-macro analysis of electrohydrodynamics, electrophoresis, fuel cells, and ion channels. We derive generalized Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations that are coupled to generalized Navier–Stokes equations for fluid dynamics, Newton’s equation for molecular dynamics, and potential and surface driving geometric flows for the micro-macro interface. For excessively large aqueous macromolecular complexes in chemistry and biology, we further develop differential geometry based multiscale fluid-electro-elastic models to replace the expensive molecular dynamics description with an alternative elasticity formulation.","Guo-Wei Wei1,",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-010-9511-x,"Variational principle,Multiscale,Geometric flows,Solvation analysis,Electrostatic analysis,Implicit solvent models,Molecular dynamics,Elasticity,Navier–Stokes equation,Poisson–Boltzmann equation,Nernst–Planck equation"
40,Envelope of Mid-Planes of a Surface and Some Classical Notions of Affine Differential Geometry,"For a pair of points in a smooth locally convex surface in 3-space, its mid-plane is the plane containing its mid-point and the intersection line of the corresponding pair of tangent planes. In this paper we show that the limit of mid-planes when one point tends to the other along a direction is the Transon plane of the direction. Moreover, the limit of the envelope of mid-planes is non-empty for at most six directions, and, in this case, it coincides with the center of the Moutard’s quadric. These results establish a connection between these classical notions of affine differential geometry and the apparently unrelated concept of envelope of mid-planes of a surface. We call the limit of envelope of mid-planes the affine mid-planes evolute and prove that, under some generic conditions, it is a regular surface in 3-space.",Ady Cambraia Jr.1 & Marcos Craizer,Results in Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00025-017-0697-1,53A15

The optimal tunnel is shown to have a constant turn rate with zero torsion and is equivalent to Edelbaum's hypocycloid solution. The solutions are obtained using the maximum principle and singular arc conditions. The optimal curvature is a first-order singular arc and the optimal torsion is a second-order singular arc. Our treatment includes both the normal and the abnormal optimal control problems. Our problem is abnormal for the case where the final speed is zero. Analytical solutions for the optimal time histories are derived for all states and all adjoint states.

49,Symmetries in Differential Geometry: a Computational Approach to Prolongations,"
The aim of this work is to develop a systematic manner to close overdetermined systems arising from conformal Killing tensors (CKT). The research performs this action for 1-tensor and 2-tensors. This research makes it possible to develop a new general method for any rank of CKT. This method can also be applied to other types of Killing equations, as well as to overdetermined systems constrained by some other conditions.

The major methodological apparatus of the research is a decomposition of the section bundles where the covariant derivatives of the CKT land via generalized gradients. This decomposition generates a tree in which each row represents a higher derivative. After using the conformal Killing equation, just a few components (branches) survive, which means that most of them can be expressed in terms of lower order terms. This results in a finite number of independent jets. Thus, any higher covariant derivative can be written in terms of these jets.

The findings of this work are significant methodologically and, more specifically, in the potential for the discovery of symmetries. First, this work has uncovered a new method that could be used to close overdetermined systems arising from conformal Killing tensors (CKT). Second, through an application of this method, this research finds higher symmetry operators of first and second degree, which are known by other means, for the Laplace operator. The findings also reveal the first order symmetry operators for the Yamabe case. Moreover, the research leads to conjectures about the second order symmetries of the Yamabe operator.

The complex fracture network of a NFR produces anomalous fluid flow, which is shown by the pressure behavior at the well. A plausible model to explain this behavior is to assume that it arises from a fractal fracture system. However, to estimate the parameters that define this fractal fracture system, fluid flow models based on the modification of Darcy’s law are used. On the other hand, in this work, a fractal structure with known fractal dimension: Sierpinski gasket (SG) is proposed. The objective of this work is to solve numerically the diffusion equation on SG, and establish a comparison with flow models used in the oil industry to investigate the fractality assumption. This study is focused on the qualitative behavior of the solution of the diffusion equation defined on a SG supported by the Kigami’s theory of differential equations on fractals.","Jesús M.

64,Differential geometry based solvation model II: Lagrangian formulation,"Solvation is an elementary process in nature and is of paramount importance to more sophisticated chemical, biological and biomolecular processes. The understanding of solvation is an essential prerequisite for the quantitative description and analysis of biomolecular systems. This work presents a Lagrangian formulation of our differential geometry based solvation models. The Lagrangian representation of biomolecular surfaces has a few utilities/advantages. First, it provides an essential basis for biomolecular visualization, surface electrostatic potential map and visual perception of biomolecules. Additionally, it is consistent with the conventional setting of implicit solvent theories and thus, many existing theoretical algorithms and computational software packages can be directly employed. Finally, the Lagrangian representation does not need to resort to artificially enlarged van der Waals radii as often required by the Eulerian representation in solvation analysis. The main goal of the present work is to analyze the connection, similarity and difference between the Eulerian and Lagrangian formalisms of the solvation model. Such analysis is important to the understanding of the differential geometry based solvation model. The present model extends the scaled particle theory of nonpolar solvation model with a solvent–solute interaction potential. The nonpolar solvation model is completed with a Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) theory based polar solvation model. The differential geometry theory of surfaces is employed to provide a natural description of solvent–solute interfaces. The optimization of the total free energy functional, which encompasses the polar and nonpolar contributions, leads to coupled potential driven geometric flow and PB equations. Due to the development of singularities and nonsmooth manifolds in the Lagrangian representation, the resulting potential-driven geometric flow equation is embedded into the Eulerian representation for the purpose of computation, thanks to the equivalence of the Laplace–Beltrami operator in the two representations. The coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) are solved with an iterative procedure to reach a steady state, which delivers desired solvent–solute interface and electrostatic potential for problems of interest. These quantities are utilized to evaluate the solvation free energies and protein–protein binding affinities. A number of computational methods and algorithms are described for the interconversion of Lagrangian and Eulerian representations, and for the solution of the coupled PDE system. The proposed approaches have been extensively validated. We also verify that the mean curvature flow indeed gives rise to the minimal molecular surface and the proposed variational procedure indeed offers minimal total free energy. Solvation analysis and applications are considered for a set of 17 small compounds and a set of 23 proteins. The salt effect on protein–protein binding affinity is investigated with two protein complexes by using the present model. Numerical results are compared to the experimental measurements and to those obtained by using other theoretical methods in the literature.","Zhan Chen1, Nathan A. Baker2 & G. W.

76,"Stieltjes integration and differential geometry: A model for enzyme recognition, discrimination, and catalysis","A model for enzymic catalysis is presented using the mathematical theories of differential geometry and Stieltjes integration. The Stieltjesintegrator is a complex-valued function of bounded variation which represents the curvature and torsion, hence the conformation, of the backbone of an enzyme molecule. Theintegrand is a complex-valued continuous function which describes the shape of the surface of a substrate molecule. We postulate that enzyme-substrate interactions correspond to evaluations of Stieltjes integrals, and that observables of enzymic catalysis correspond to projections.Results from the mathematical theory of the Stieltjes integral are discussed together with their biological interpretations. We contrast the difference between structural and functional proteins, and construct analogues of enzyme cofactors, modifications, and regulation. Various techniques of locating the active site on enzymes are also given. We construct a total variation metric, which is particularly useful for detecting similarities among proteins.An examination on the many different modes of convergence of mathematical functions representing biological molecules leads to a mathematical statement of the fundamental dogma of molecular biology, that ‘structure implies function’. Similar arguments also result in the converse statement ‘function dictates structure’, which is a basic premise of relational biology.Stepped-helical approximations of the backbone space curves of enzymes provide a concrete computational tool with which to calculate the Stieltjes integrals that model enzymic catalysis, by replacing the integral with a finite series.The duality between enzymes and substrates (that they aremeters ‘observing’ one another) is shown to be a consequence of the mathematical duality of Banach spaces. The Stieltjes integrals of enzyme-substrate interactions are hence shown to be bounded bilinear functionals. The mechanism of enzymic catalysis, the transformation from substrate to product, is also formulated in the Stieltjes integration context via the mathematical theory of adjoints.The paper closes with suggestions for generalizations, prospects for future studies, and a review of the correspondence between mathematical and biological concepts.",A.

Then we can define concepts of principal, Gaussian, and mean curvatures in terms of the eigenvalues of the differential of this map. Considering planar sections containing the normal field, we also define normal curvatures at each point of the surface, and with respect to each tangent direction. We investigate the relations between these curvature types.

We examine here in which way this calculus can be used as a framework for a differential geometry of fractional order. One will examine successively implicit function, manifold, length of curves, radius of curvature, Christoffel coefficients, velocity, acceleration.

We show that such G-structures, called almost hypercomplex/quaternionic skew-Hermitian structures, form the symplectic analogue of the better known almost hypercomplex/quaternionic-Hermitian structures (hH/qH for short). We present several equivalent definitions of \({{\mathrm{\mathsf {SO}}}}^*(2n)\)- and \({{\mathrm{\mathsf {SO}}}}^*(2n){{\mathrm{\mathsf {Sp}}}}(1)\)-structures in terms of almost symplectic forms compatible with an almost hypercomplex/quaternionic structure, a quaternionic skew-Hermitian form, or a symmetric 4-tensor, the latter establishing the counterpart of the fundamental 4-form in almost hH/qH geometries. The intrinsic torsion of such structures is presented in terms of Salamon’s \({{\mathrm{\mathsf {E}}}}{{\mathrm{\mathsf {H}}}}\)-formalism, and the algebraic types of the corresponding geometries are classified. We construct explicit adapted connections to our G-structures and specify certain normalization conditions, under which these connections become minimal.

104,Geometry of conservation laws for a class of parabolic partial differential equations," I consider the problem of computing the space of conservation laws for a second-order parabolic partial differential equation for one function of three independent variables. The PDE is formulated as an exterior differential system \({\cal I}\) on a 12-manifold M, and its conservation laws are identified with the vector space of closed 3-forms in the infinite prolongation of \({\cal I}\) modulo the so-called ""trivial"" conservation laws. I use the tools of exterior differential systems and Cartan's method of equivalence to study the structure of the space of conservation laws. My main result is: Theorem.
Any conservation law for a second-order parabolic PDE for one function of three independent variables can be represented by a closed 3-form in the differential ideal 

${\cal I}$
 on the original 12-manifold M. I show that if a nontrivial conservation law exists, then \({\cal I}\) has a deprolongation to an equivalent system \({\cal J}\) on a 7-manifold N, and any conservation law for \({\cal I}\) can be expressed as a closed 3-form on N that lies in \({\cal J}\).

105,Differential Geometry of Magnetic and Killing Magnetic Trajectories in de Sitter 3-Space,"AbstractThis paper is concerned to study normal magnetic trajectories of charged particles which move under the influence of Lorentz force generated by static magnetic fields on de Sitter 3-space \(\mathbb{S}^{3}_{1}\) so that our study coincides with the theory of magnetostatics in the ambience of Physics. First, we observe how the associated Lorentz force acts on the vector fields in the dynamic Frenet frame or pseudo-orthonormal frame along the trajectory depending on its causality. Based on this, we characterize magnetic trajectories in respect of their Frenet apparatus. Afterwards, we present a geometrical model of hyperbolic quaternions for \(\mathbb{S}^{3}_{1}\) where we identified \(\mathbb{S}^{3}_{1}\) with a subspace of the Lie group \(\mathbb{H}\) of hyperbolic quaternions and obtain Killing vector fields on \(\mathbb{S}^{3}_{1}\) forming a basis for the concerned six-dimensional Lie algebra. We also characterize Killing vector fields along regular curves in \(\mathbb{S}^{3}_{1}\) and observe that they can be extended to Killing vector fields on \(\mathbb{S}^{3}_{1}\) (in respect of their causality) and vice-versa. Finally, we characterize and classify normal Killing magnetic trajectories in \(\mathbb{S}^{3}_{1}\) in terms of their quasi-slope, curvature and torsion or pseudo-torsion based on their causality.",Zafar Iqbal,Lobachevskii Journal of Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1995080222050158,"de Sitter 3-space,Geodesic,Magnetic field,Magnetic trajectory,Hyperbolic quaternion,Killing vector field"
106,"Noncommutative differential geometry, quantization, and smooth symmetries of the C*-algebras associated to topological dynamics",Noncommutative differential geometric structures are considered for a class of simple C*-algebras. This structure is defined in terms of smooth Lie group actions on the C*-algebra in question together with a certain quantization mapping motivated directly by the known cohomological obstructions for the quantum mechanical quantization correspondence. We show that such a quantization mapping may be constructed for the C*-algebras associated to antisymmetric bi-characters and for the Cuntz/Cuntz-Krieger C*-algebras associated to topological dynamics. A certain curvature obstruction is defined in terms of the quantization mapping. It is shown that existence of smooth Lie group actions is determined by the curvature obstruction.,Palle E. T.

108,Algebraic geometry of Abel differential equation,"A solution \(y(x)\) of an Abel differential equation \((1) \ y^{\prime }=p(x)y^2 + q(x) y^3\) is called “closed” on \([a,b]\) if \(y(a)=y(b)\). The equation \((1)\) is said to have a center on \([a,b]\) if all its solutions (with the initial value \(y(a)\) small enough) are closed. The problems of counting closed solutions (Smale–Pugh problem) is strongly related to the classical Hilbert 16th problem of bounding the number of limit cycles of a plane polynomial vector field. In turn, the problem of giving conditions on \((p,q,a,b)\) for \((1)\) to have a center on \([a,b]\) is analogous to the classical Poincaré center–focus problem for plane vector fields. It is well known that both in the classical and in the Abel equation cases the center conditions are given by an infinite system of polynomial equations in the parameter space. The complexity of this system presents one of the main difficulties in the center–focus problem, as well as in the bounding of closed trajectories. In recent years two important structures have been related to the center equations for \((1)\): composition algebra and moment vanishing. In the present paper we give an overview of these results (sometimes providing also new ones), stressing their algebraic–geometric interpretation and consequences. The second part of the paper is devoted to a rather detailed study of a specific example of the Abel equation which possesses algebraic solutions. We identify complex closed solutions, stressing their ramification properties. In particular, we analyze the continuation paths along which these solutions become closed.","Sh. Giat1, Y. Shelah1, C.

After solving the equivalence problem we obtain the fundamental invariants, find the local generality of several classes of Cayley structures and give examples.","Wojciech Kryński1 & Omid Makhmali

111,Geometry and analysis in Euler’s integral calculus,"Euler developed a program which aimed to transform analysis into an autonomous discipline and reorganize the whole of mathematics around it. The implementation of this program presented many difficulties, and the result was not entirely satisfactory. Many of these difficulties concerned the integral calculus. In this paper, we deal with some topics relevant to understand Euler’s conception of analysis and how he developed and implemented his program. In particular, we examine Euler’s contribution to the construction of differential equations and his notion of indefinite integrals and general integrals. We also deal with two remarkable difficulties of Euler’s program. The first concerns singular integrals, which were considered as paradoxical by Euler since they seemed to violate the generality of certain results. The second regards the explicitly use of the geometric representation and meaning of definite integrals, which was gone against his program. We clarify the nature of these difficulties and show that Euler never thought that they undermined his conception of mathematics and that a different foundation was necessary for analysis.","Giovanni Capobianco1, Maria Rosaria Enea2 & Giovanni Ferraro",Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-016-0179-y,"Elementary Function,Singular Integral,Differential Calculus,Transcendental Function,Geometric Problem"

116,Uniform Shapiro-Lopatinski Conditions and Boundary Value Problems on Manifolds with Bounded Geometry,"We study the regularity of the solutions of second order boundary value problems on manifolds with boundary and bounded geometry. We first show that the regularity property of a given boundary value problem (P,C) is equivalent to the uniform regularity of the natural family (Px,Cx) of associated boundary value problems in local coordinates. We verify that this property is satisfied for the Dirichlet boundary conditions and strongly elliptic operators via a compactness argument. We then introduce a uniform Shapiro-Lopatinski regularity condition, which is a modification of the classical one, and we prove that it characterizes the boundary value problems that satisfy the usual regularity property. We also show that the natural Robin boundary conditions always satisfy the uniform Shapiro-Lopatinski regularity condition, provided that our operator satisfies the strong Legendre condition. This is achieved by proving that “well-posedness implies regularity” via a modification of the classical “Nirenberg trick”. When combining our regularity results with the Poincaré inequality of (Ammann-Große-Nistor, preprint 2015), one obtains the usual well-posedness results for the classical boundary value problems in the usual scale of Sobolev spaces, thus extending these important, well-known theorems from smooth, bounded domains, to manifolds with boundary and bounded geometry. As we show in several examples, these results do not hold true anymore if one drops the bounded geometry assumption. We also introduce a uniform Agmon condition and show that it is equivalent to the coerciveness. Consequently, we prove a well-posedness result for parabolic equations whose elliptic generator satisfies the uniform Agmon condition.","Nadine Große

119,"Differential Structure, Tangent Structure, and SDG","In 1984, J. Rosický gave an abstract presentation of the structure associated to tangent bundle functors in differential and algebraic geometry. By slightly generalizing this notion, we show that tangent structure is also fundamentally related to the more recently introduced Cartesian differential categories. In particular, tangent structure of a trivial bundle is precisely the same as Cartesian differential structure. We also provide a general result which shows how tangent structure arises from the manifold completion (in the sense of M. Grandis) of a differential restriction category. This construction includes all standard atlas-based constructions from differential geometry. Furthermore, we tighten the relationship, which Rosický had noted, between representable tangent structure and synthetic differential geometry, showing how such settings can be developed from a system of infinitesimal objects. We also show how infinitesimal objects give rise to dual tangent structure. Taken together, these results show that tangent structures appropriately span a very wide range of definitions, from the syntactic and structural differentials arising in computer science and combinatorics, through the concrete manifolds of algebraic and differential geometry, and finally to the abstract definitions of synthetic differential geometry.","J.

126,Functional determinants and geometry,"In this paper we study the zeta-function determinant in the context of elliptic boundary value problems. Our main technique is to relate the determinant of an operator, or a ratio of determinants, to the boundary values of the solutions of the operator. This has the advantage of restricting attention to the solutions of the operator, which do not depend on the boundary conditions and can often be written down explicitly, rather than the eigenvalues, which are usually difficult to work with. In addition, the problem is reduced to a calculation over the boundary of the manifold which is a closed manifold of dimension one less than the original manifold. This has special significance in the case that the manifold is a finite interval. In this case the boundary is a pair of points and the determinant of an ordinary differential operator is expressed in terms of the determinant of a finite matrix.The results are then applied to some geometric operators. In Sect. 4 we study the Jacobi operator acting along a geodesic segment and the covariant derivative operator acting along a loop. In Sect. 2 we calculate the determinant of the Laplacian acting on sections of a flat bundle over a flat torus. This can be related to an Eisenstein series and thus we have presented a new geometric method of summing such series. This sum is known as Kroneker's Second Limit formula. We then consider operators on a product manifoldM×S

130,"Conformal geometry of marginally trapped surfaces in \(\mathbb {S}^4_1\)
","A spacelike surface S immersed in \(\mathbb {S}^4_1\) is marginally trapped if its mean curvature vector is everywhere lightlike. On any oriented spacelike surface S immersed in \(\mathbb {S}^4_1\) we show that a choice of orientation of the normal bundle \(\nu (S)\) determines a smooth map \(G: S \rightarrow \mathbb {S}^3\) which we call the null Gauss map of S. If S is marginally trapped we show that G is a conformal immersion away from the zeros of certain quadratic Hopf-differential of S and so the surface G(S) is uniquely determined up to conformal transformations of \(\mathbb {S}^3\) by two invariants: the normal Hopf differential \(\kappa \) and the schwartzian derivative s. These invariants plus an additional quadratic differential \(\delta \) are related by a differential equation and determine the geometry of S up to ambient isometries of \(\mathbb {S}^4_1\). This allows us to obtain a characterization of marginally trapped surfaces S whose null Gauss image is a constrained Willmore surface in \(\mathbb {S}^3\) in the sense of Bohle et al.

We identify each synchronization problem in topological group G on connected graph \(\Gamma \) with a flat principal G-bundle over \(\Gamma \), thus establishing a classification result for synchronization problems using the representation variety of the fundamental group of \(\Gamma \) into G. We then develop a twisted Hodge theory on flat vector bundles associated with these flat principal G-bundles, and provide a geometric realization of the graph connection Laplacian as the lowest-degree Hodge Laplacian in the twisted de Rham–Hodge cochain complex. Motivated by these geometric intuitions, we propose to study the problem of learning group actions—partitioning a collection of objects based on the local synchronizability of pairwise correspondence relations—and provide a heuristic synchronization-based algorithm for solving this type of problems.

140,The Finsler geometry of the Teichmüller metric,This paper is a brief survey of some results on the Finsler structures of Teichmüller metric. We mainly describe the connection between holomorphic quadratic differentials and extremal length of measured foliations.

Teichmüller theory is probably the best example of an instance where Finsler geometry enters in the field of low dimensional geometry and topology.,"Weixu Su1,2 & Youliang Zhong",European Journal of Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40879-017-0161-5,"Extremal length,Quadratic differential,Teichmüller metric"
141,"Smooth Rough Paths, Their Geometry and Algebraic Renormalization","We introduce the class of “smooth rough paths” and study their main properties. Working in a smooth setting allows us to discard sewing arguments and focus on algebraic and geometric aspects. Specifically, a Maurer–Cartan perspective is the key to a purely algebraic form of Lyons’ extension theorem, the renormalization of rough paths following up on [Bruned et al.: A rough path perspective on renormalization, J. Funct. Anal. 277(11), 2019], as well as a related notion of “sum of rough paths”. We first develop our ideas in a geometric rough path setting, as this best resonates with recent works on signature varieties, as well as with the renormalization of geometric rough paths. We then explore extensions to the quasi-geometric and the more general Hopf algebraic setting.","Carlo Bellingeri1, Peter K. Friz

142,Algebraic foliations and derived geometry: the Riemann–Hilbert correspondence,"This is the first in a series of papers about foliations in derived geometry. After introducing derived foliations on arbitrary derived stacks, we concentrate on quasi-smooth and rigid derived foliations on smooth complex algebraic varieties and on their associated formal and analytic versions. Their truncations are classical singular foliations defined in terms of differential ideals in the algebra of forms. We prove that a quasi-smooth rigid derived foliation on a smooth complex variety X is formally integrable at any point, and, if we suppose that its singular locus has codimension \(\ge 2\), its analytification is a locally integrable singular foliation on the associated complex manifold \(X^h\). We then introduce the derived category of perfect crystals on a quasi-smooth rigid derived foliation on X, and prove a Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for them when X is proper. We discuss several examples and applications.

To achieve discretizations with high precision and symmetry, we develop hyperinterpolation methods based on spherical harmonics and Lebedev quadrature. We perform convergence studies of our numerical exterior derivative operator \(\overline{\mathbf {d}}\) and Hodge star operator \(\overline{\star }\) showing each converge spectrally to \(\mathbf {d}\) and \(\star \).

The classification is cleared up, i.e. each copy is equivalent to exactly one representative. This applies as well to the corresponding groups as to the orbits (and also to the parameter cases). In particular, we can characterize the Clifford tori in a purely affine manner and determine all homogeneous centroaffine spheres. This answers a former question on the existence of centroaffine spheres which are not contained in a hyperplane. The classification and, in particular, the uniqueness is based on geometric insight and is essentially not computer dependent.

Under very mild regularity assumptions on Q that guarantee that \(\nabla ^{\dagger }\nabla /2+Q\) canonically induces a holomorphic semigroup \(\mathrm {e}^{-zH^{\nabla }_{Q}}\) in \(\Gamma _{L^2}(\mathscr {M},\mathscr {E})\) (where z runs through a complex sector which contains \([0,\infty )\)), we prove an explicit Feynman–Kac type formula for \(\mathrm {e}^{-tH^{\nabla }_{Q}}\), \(t>0\), generalizing the standard self-adjoint theory where Q is a self-adjoint zeroth order operator. For compact \(\mathscr {M}\)’s we combine this formula with Berezin integration to derive a Feynman–Kac type formula for an operator trace of the form $$\begin{aligned} \mathrm {Tr}\left( \widetilde{V}\int ^t_0\mathrm {e}^{-sH^{\nabla }_{V}}P\mathrm {e}^{-(t-s)H^{\nabla }_{V}}\mathrm {d}s\right) , \end{aligned}$$where \(V,\widetilde{V}\) are of zeroth order and P is of order \(\le 1\). These formulae are then used to obtain a probabilistic representations of the lower order terms of the equivariant Chern character (a differential graded extension of the JLO-cocycle) of a compact even-dimensional Riemannian spin manifold, which in combination with cyclic homology play a crucial role in the context of the Duistermaat–Heckmann localization formula on the loop space of such a manifold.","Sebastian Boldt

Review of derived geometry and of the phenomenon of “recovery of missing features”.

Information geometry involves studying a Riemannian manifold having a pair of dual affine connections. Such a structure also arises from an asymmetric divergence function and affine differential geometry. A dually flat Riemannian manifold is particularly useful for various applications, because a generalized Pythagorean theorem and projection theorem hold.

164,Geometry of curves with fractional-order tangent vector and Frenet-Serret formulas,"This paper discusses a construction of fractional differential geometry of curves (curvature of curve and Frenet-Serret formulas). A tangent vector of plane curve is defined by the Caputo fractional derivative. Under a simplification for the fractional derivative of composite function, a fractional expression of Frenet frame of curve is obtained. Then, the Frenet-Serret formulas and the curvature are derived for the fractional ordered frame. The different property from the ordinary theory of curve is given by the explicit expression of arclength in the fractional-order curvature. The arclength part of the curvature takes a large value around an initial time and converges to zero for a long period of time. This trend of curvature may reflect the memory effect of fractional derivative which is progressively weaken for a long period of time. Indeed, for a circle and a parabola, the curvature decreases over time. These results suggest that the basic property of fractional derivative is included in the fractional-order curvature appropriately.","Takahiro Yajima1, Shunya Oiwa1 & Kazuhito Yamasaki",Fractional Calculus and Applied Analysis,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1515/fca-2018-0078,"Primary 26A33,Secondary 53A40"

We review its importance as a domain with nontrivial Nebenhülle, and as a counterexample to a number of basic questions in complex geometric analysis. Then we discuss its more recent significance in the theory of partial differential equations: the worm is the first smoothly bounded, pseudoconvex domain to exhibit global non-regularity for the

If in addition ξ is geodesic then it is a harmonic vector field. As an other application, we study pseudoharmonic vector fields on a compact strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold M, i.e. unit (with respect to the Webster metric associated with a fixed contact form on M) vector fields X ε H(M) whose horizontal lift X↑ to the canonical circle bundle S1 → C(M) → M is a critical point of the Dirichlet energy functional associated to the Fefferman metric (a Lorentz metric on C(M)).

186,"From Harmonic Maps to the Nonlinear Supersymmetric Sigma Model of Quantum Field Theory: at the Interface of Theoretical Physics, Riemannian Geometry, and Nonlinear Analysis","Harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces arise from a conformally invariant variational problem. Therefore, on one hand, they are intimately connected with moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, and on the other hand, because the conformal group is noncompact, constitute a prototype for the formation of singularities, the so-called bubbles, in geometric analysis. In theoretical physics, they arise from the nonlinear \(\sigma \)-model of quantum field theory. That model possesses a supersymmetric extension, coupling a harmonic map like field with a nonlinear spinor field. In the physical model, that spinor field is anticommuting. In this contribution, we analyze both a mathematical version with a commuting spinor field and the original supersymmetric version. Moreover, this model gives rise to a further field, a gravitino, that can be seen as the supersymmetric partner of a Riemann surface metric. Altogether, this leads to a beautiful combination of concepts from quantum field theory, structures from Riemannian geometry and Riemann surface theory, and methods of nonlinear geometric analysis.","Jürgen Jost1, Enno Keßler1, Jürgen Tolksdorf1,2, Ruijun Wu1 & …Miaomiao Zhu",Vietnam Journal of Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10013-018-0298-7,"Harmonic maps,Dirac-harmonic maps,Non-linear sigma model,Supersymmetry,Gravitino"

193,Pseudo-Riemannian geometry encodes information geometry in optimal transport,"Optimal transport and information geometry both study geometric structures on spaces of probability distributions. Optimal transport characterizes the cost-minimizing movement from one distribution to another, while information geometry originates from coordinate invariant properties of statistical inference. Their relations and applications in statistics and machine learning have started to gain more attention. In this paper we give a new differential-geometric relation between the two fields. Namely, the pseudo-Riemannian framework of Kim and McCann, which provides a geometric perspective on the fundamental Ma–Trudinger–Wang (MTW) condition in the regularity theory of optimal transport maps, encodes the dualistic structure of statistical manifold. This general relation is described using the framework of c-divergence under which divergences are defined by optimal transport maps. As a by-product, we obtain a new information-geometric interpretation of the MTW tensor on the graph of the transport map. This relation sheds light on old and new aspects of information geometry. The dually flat geometry of Bregman divergence corresponds to the quadratic cost and the pseudo-Euclidean space, and the logarithmic \(L^{(\alpha )}\)-divergence introduced by Pal and the first author has constant sectional curvature in a sense to be made precise. In these cases we give a geometric interpretation of the information-geometric curvature in terms of the divergence between a primal-dual pair of geodesics.","Ting-Kam Leonard Wong

195,A simplicial foundation for differential and sector forms in tangent categories,"Tangent categories provide an axiomatic framework for understanding various tangent bundles and differential operations that occur in differential geometry, algebraic geometry, abstract homotopy theory, and computer science. Previous work has shown that one can formulate and prove a wide variety of definitions and results from differential geometry in an arbitrary tangent category, including generalizations of vector fields and their Lie bracket, vector bundles, and connections. In this paper we investigate differential and sector forms in tangent categories. We show that sector forms in any tangent category have a rich structure: they form a symmetric cosimplicial object. This appears to be a new result in differential geometry, even for smooth manifolds. In the category of smooth manifolds, the resulting complex of sector forms has a subcomplex isomorphic to the de Rham complex of differential forms, which may be identified with alternating sector forms. Further, the symmetric cosimplicial structure on sector forms arises naturally through a new equational presentation of symmetric cosimplicial objects, which we develop herein.",G. S. H.

Information geometry is a differential geometric framework specifically tailored to deal with convexity, naturally arising in information science including statistics, machine learning and signal processing etc. First we introduce an information geometric framework of conic programming. Then we focus on semidefinite and symmetric cone programs. Recently, we demonstrated that the number of iterations of Mizuno–Todd–Ye predictor–corrector primal–dual interior-point methods is (asymptotically) expressed with an integral over the central trajectory called “the curvature integral”. The number of iterations of the algorithm is approximated surprisingly well with the integral even for fairly large linear/semidefinite programs with thousands of variables. Here we prove that “the curvature integral” admits a rigorous differential geometric expression based on information geometry. We also obtain an interesting information geometric global theorem on the central trajectory for linear programs. Together with the numerical evidence in the aforementioned work, we claim that “the number of iterations of the interior-point algorithm is expressed as a differential geometric quantity.”","Satoshi Kakihara1, Atsumi Ohara2 & Takashi Tsuchiya",Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-012-0180-9,"Interior-point methods,Iteration complexities,Curvature integral,Semidefinite programs,Symmetric cone programs,Conic programming,Information geometry"

209,On the Hausdorff volume in sub-Riemannian geometry,"For a regular sub-Riemannian manifold we study the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the spherical Hausdorff measure with respect to a smooth volume. We prove that this is the volume of the unit ball in the nilpotent approximation and it is always a continuous function. We then prove that up to dimension 4 it is smooth, while starting from dimension 5, in corank 1 case, it is \({\mathcal {C}^{3}}\) (and \({\mathcal {C}^{4}}\) on every smooth curve) but in general not \({\mathcal {C}^{5}}\). These results answer to a question addressed by Montgomery about the relation between two intrinsic volumes that can be defined in a sub-Riemannian manifold, namely the Popp and the Hausdorff volume. If the nilpotent approximation depends on the point (that may happen starting from dimension 5), then they are not proportional, in general.","Andrei Agrachev1,2, Davide Barilari1 & Ugo Boscain",Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00526-011-0414-y,"53C17,58C35"

211,On the solutions to certain laplace inequalities with applications to geometry of submanifolds,"LetM be a complete Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature bounded from below. We give an explicit estimate for the size of the negative sets of solutions to the differential inequality Δu ≥λu where Δ is the Laplacian and λ is a negative constant. This inequality arises naturally when we study the lengthH of the mean curvature of an isometric immersionf of M into another Riemannian manifoldN with curvature bounded above by some constantκ. Suppose that the image f(M) does not meet the cut locus of some pointo ∈ N. As a consequence of our estimate, we prove that, givenρ > 0, if supH is less than a certain explicit expression μ(κ, ρ) inρ andκ on any domainU that contains an inscribed ball of radius greater than an explicitly computable numberR, then the diameter of the setf(U) inN must exceed 2ρ. Moreover, if supH = μ(κ, ρ) onM and the diameter off(M) inN equals 2ρ, thenf is a minimal immersion into a distance sphere of radiusρ inN.","Leslie Coghlan1, Yoe Itokawa1 & Roman Kosecki",The Journal of Geometric Analysis,1992,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02921293,"58G30,58G25,53C40"

We then extend and complete the work in Musso (Math Nachr 165:107–131, 1994) by solving the Euler–Lagrange equations for the curvatures and by providing an explicit expression even for those conformal geodesics not included in any conformal 3-sphere.","Marco Magliaro1, Luciano Mari1 & Marco Rigoli",Annals of Global Analysis and Geometry,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10455-011-9250-8,"Conformal space,Mobius group,Conformal geodesic,Moving frame method"

233,Sobolev spaces and \(\nabla \)-differential operators on manifolds I: basic properties and weighted spaces,"We study covariant Sobolev spaces and \(\nabla \) -differential operators with coefficients in general Hermitian vector bundles on Riemannian manifolds, stressing a coordinate-free approach that uses connections (which are typically denoted \(\nabla \)). These concepts arise naturally from geometric partial differential equations, including some that are formulated on plain Euclidean domains, for instance, from problems formulated on the boundary of smooth domains or in relation to the weighted Sobolev spaces used to study PDEs on polyhedral domains. We prove several basic properties of the covariant Sobolev spaces and of the \(\nabla \)-differential operators on general manifolds. For instance, we prove mapping properties for our differential operators and the independence of the covariant Sobolev spaces on the choices of the connection \(\nabla \), as long as the new connection is obtained using a totally bounded perturbation. We also introduce the Fréchet finiteness condition (FFC) for totally bounded vector fields, which is satisfied, for instance, by open subsets of manifolds with bounded geometry. When (FFC) is satisfied, we provide several equivalent definitions of our covariant Sobolev spaces and of our \(\nabla \)-differential operators. We also introduce and study the notion of a \(\nabla \)-bidifferential operator (a bilinear version of differential operators), obtaining results similar to those obtained for \(\nabla \)-differential operators. Bilinear differential operators are necessary for a global, geometric discussion of variational problems. We tried to write the paper so that it is accessible to a large audience.","Mirela Kohr1 & Victor Nistor2,",Annals of Global Analysis and Geometry,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10455-022-09824-6,"Sobolev spaces,Weighted Sobolev spaces,Differential operators,Bidifferential operator,Riemannian manifolds,Levi–Civita connection,Bounded curvature"
234,"Differential Equations in a Tangent Category I: Complete Vector Fields, Flows, and Exponentials","This paper describes how to define and work with differential equations in the abstract setting of tangent categories. The key notion is that of a curve object which is, for differential geometry, the structural analogue of a natural number object. A curve object is a preinitial object for dynamical systems; dynamical systems may, in turn, be viewed as determining systems of differential equations. The unique map from the curve object to a dynamical system is a solution of the system, and a dynamical system is said to be complete when for all initial conditions there is a solution. A subtle issue concerns the question of when a dynamical system is complete, and the paper provides abstract conditions for this. This abstract formulation also allows new perspectives on topics such as commutative vector fields and flows. In addition, the stronger notion of a differential curve object, which is the centrepiece of the last section of the paper, has exponential maps and forms a differential exponential rig. This rig then, somewhat surprisingly, has an action on every differential object and bundle in the setting. In this manner, in a very strong sense, such a curve object plays the role of the real numbers in standard differential geometry.

It is shown that any p-form defined on the smooth locus of a variety with canonical or klt singularities extends regularly to any resolution of singularities. In fact, a much more general theorem for log canonical pairs is established. The proof relies on vanishing theorems for log canonical varieties and on methods of the minimal model program. In addition, a theory of differential forms on dlt pairs is developed. It is shown that many of the fundamental theorems and techniques known for sheaves of logarithmic differentials on smooth varieties also hold in the dlt setting.Immediate applications include the existence of a pull-back map for reflexive differentials, generalisations of Bogomolov-Sommese type vanishing results, and a positive answer to the Lipman-Zariski conjecture for klt spaces.","Daniel Greb1, Stefan Kebekus1, Sándor J Kovács2 & …Thomas Peternell",Publications mathématiques de l'IHÉS,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10240-011-0036-0,"Differential Form,Extension Theorem,Exceptional Divisor,Residue Sequence,Canonical Singularity"

Here, we only consider examples with linear constraints (defined by a constant rank distribution), in which we have conservation of volume. Conservation of volume means, equivalently, that the orthogonal distribution (the metric is defined by the kinetic energy) is minimal (see [15]) and so, if it is integrable, the corresponding foliation has minimal leaves. Properties of the falling penny and of the vertical disc rolling on a horizontal plane without slipping are very special. A dynamically symmetric sphere that rolls without slipping on a given surfaceS⊂ℝ3 conserves volume, and the orthogonal distribution is integrable if, and only if,S isparallel to a surface with a fixed constant mean curvature. Semi-simple Lie groups endowed with suitable metrics have foliations with minimal leaves.

As a generalization of this result, it is proved that the cyclographic mapping transforms any EO mesh in a hyperplane of Minkowksi 4-space into a pair of Euclidean EO meshes. This result leads to a derivation of EO meshes which are discrete versions of Laguerre minimal surfaces. Laguerre minimal EO meshes can also be constructed directly from certain pairs of Koebe meshes with help of a discrete Laguerre geometric counterpart of the classical Christoffel duality.","Helmut Pottmann1, Philipp Grohs1 & Bernhard Blaschitz",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-009-9119-6,"Discrete differential geometry,Laguerre geometry,Edge offset mesh,Koebe polyhedron,Minimal surface,Laguerre minimal surface"
246,Section extension from hyperbolic geometry of punctured disk and holomorphic family of flat bundles,"The construction of sections of bundles with prescribed jet values plays a fundamental role in problems of algebraic and complex geometry. When the jet values are prescribed on a positive dimensional subvariety, it is handled by theorems of Ohsawa-Takegoshi type which give extension of line bundle valued square-integrable top-degree holomorphic forms from the fiber at the origin of a family of complex manifolds over the open unit 1-disk when the curvature of the metric of line bundle is semipositive. We prove here an extension result when the curvature of the line bundle is only semipositive on each fiber with negativity on the total space assumed bounded from below and the connection of the metric locally bounded, if a square-integrable extension is known to be possible over a double point at the origin. It is a Hensel-lemma-type result analogous to Artin’s application of the generalized implicit function theorem to the theory of obstruction in deformation theory. The motivation is the need in the abundance conjecture to construct pluricanonical sections from flatly twisted pluricanonical sections. We also give here a new approach to the original theorem of Ohsawa-Takegoshi by using the hyperbolic geometry of the punctured open unit 1-disk to reduce the original theorem of Ohsawa-Takegoshi to a simple application of the standard method of constructing holomorphic functions by solving the \(\bar \partial \) equation with cut-off functions and additional blowup weight functions.",Yum-Tong Siu,Science China Mathematics,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-011-4293-7,"

248,Logarithmic divergences from optimal transport and Rényi geometry,"Divergences, also known as contrast functions, are distance-like quantities defined on manifolds of non-negative or probability measures. Using the duality in optimal transport, we introduce and study the one-parameter family of \(L^{(\pm \alpha )}\)-divergences. They extrapolate between the Bregman divergence corresponding to the Euclidean quadratic cost, and the L-divergence introduced by Pal and the author in connection with portfolio theory and a logarithmic cost function. They admit natural generalizations of exponential family that are closely related to the \(\alpha \)-family and q-exponential family. In particular, the \(L^{(\pm \alpha )}\)-divergences of the corresponding potential functions are Rényi divergences. Using this unified framework we prove that the induced geometries are dually projectively flat with constant sectional curvatures, and a generalized Pythagorean theorem holds true. Conversely, we show that if a statistical manifold is dually projectively flat with constant curvature \(\pm \alpha \) with \(\alpha > 0\), then it is locally induced by an \(L^{(\mp \alpha )}\)-divergence. We define in this context a canonical divergence which extends the one for dually flat manifolds.","Ting-Kam Leonard Wong

n/G=2.The surfaces are studied by deriving and solving the reduced differential equation, which is an ODE with singularities on the boundary of the orbit space. ForG ≠U (1) the orbit space is (topologically) a 2-disk with 0, 1, 2 or 3 vertices. The case of no vertex was settled around 1970 (Hsiang-Lawson) and the case of two fixed points as vertices was analyzed in the 1980s by Hsiang and his collaborators in their study of the spherical Bernstein problem.The case of one vertex is settled in this paper. The main problem is the determination of volume function and the orbital distance metric, leading to the associated ODE. For convenience, the authors also employ numerical simulation to describe the qualitative behavior of solution curves. However, this part of the proof can be avoided by a more careful but lengthy analysis which is roughly similar to previous works in this direction.",Erik Naess1 & Eldar Straume,Geometriae Dedicata,1994,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01265325,Mathematics Subject Classifications (1991)
250,Brownian Motion and Riemannian Geometry in the Neighbourhood of a Submanifold,"Let M be a complete connected smooth Riemannian manifold of dimension n and P a q-dimensional smoothly embedded smooth submanifold of M. M0 will denote a tubular neighbourhood of P in M. Let L = \(\frac{1}{2}\Delta\) + b + c be a differential operator on M, where Δ is the Laplacian on smooth functions, b a smooth vector field on M and c a smooth potential term. Let p\(_{t}^{\mathrm{M}_{0}}(-,-)\) be the Dirichlet heat kernel of M0, and p\(_{t}^{\mathrm{M}}(-,-)\) the heat kernel of M. We will show in this article that for a smooth function f:M→R with compact support in M0, the integral \(\int_{\mathrm{P}}\)f(y)p\(_{t}^{\mathrm{M}_{0}}\)(x,y)π(dy) generalizes the usual Dirichlet heat kernel and has an asymptotic expansion of the form:
$$ \int_{\mathrm{P}}f(y)p_{t}^{\mathrm{M}_{0}}(x,y)\pi({\rm dy}) = q_{t} (x,P)\left[ \mathrm{f}(\gamma(\mathrm{t}))+\sum\limits_{\alpha=1}^{N}\mathrm{b}_{\alpha}\mathrm{(x,P)t}^{\alpha}+ \mathrm{o}(t^{N})\right] , $$where π is the Riemannian measure on P and q

 (x,P) is defined in Eq. 2.7. The asymptotic expansion is then extended to \(\int_{\mathrm{P}}\)f(y)p\(_{t}^{\mathrm{M}}\)(x,y)π(dy).

256,Orientation Maps in V1 and Non-Euclidean Geometry,"In the primary visual cortex, the processing of information uses the distribution of orientations in the visual input: neurons react to some orientations in the stimulus more than to others. In many species, orientation preference is mapped in a remarkable way on the cortical surface, and this organization of the neural population seems to be important for visual processing. Now, existing models for the geometry and development of orientation preference maps in higher mammals make a crucial use of symmetry considerations. In this paper, we consider probabilistic models for V1 maps from the point of view of group theory; we focus on Gaussian random fields with symmetry properties and review the probabilistic arguments that allow one to estimate pinwheel densities and predict the observed value of π. Then, in order to test the relevance of general symmetry arguments and to introduce methods which could be of use in modeling curved regions, we reconsider this model in the light of group representation theory, the canonical mathematics of symmetry. We show that through the Plancherel decomposition of the space of complex-valued maps on the Euclidean plane, each infinite-dimensional irreducible unitary representation of the special Euclidean group yields a unique V1-like map, and we use representation theory as a symmetry-based toolbox to build orientation maps adapted to the most famous non-Euclidean geometries, viz. spherical and hyperbolic geometry. We find that most of the dominant traits of V1 maps are preserved in these; we also study the link between symmetry and the statistics of singularities in orientation maps, and show what the striking quantitative characteristics observed in animals become in our curved models.",Alexandre Afgoustidis,The Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience (JMN),2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13408-015-0024-7,"Visual cortex,Orientation maps,Gaussian random fields,Euclidean invariance,Group representations,Non-Euclidean geometry,Pinwheel density,Kac–Rice formula"

Both are amenable to geometric modeling – recently surface approximation and subdivision-like refinement processes have been studied. In this paper we extend the original defining property of conical meshes, namely the existence of face/face offset meshes at constant distance, to circular meshes. We study the close relation between circular and conical meshes, their vertex/vertex and face/face offsets, as well as their discrete normals and focal meshes. In particular we show how to construct a two-parameter family of circular (resp., conical) meshes from a given conical (resp., circular) mesh. We further discuss meshes which have both properties and their relation to discrete surfaces of negative Gaussian curvature. The offset properties of special quadrilateral meshes and the three-dimensional support structures derived from them are highly relevant for computational architectural design of freeform structures. Another aspect important for design is that both circular and conical meshes provide a discretization of the principal curvature lines of a smooth surface, so the mesh polylines represent principal features of the surface described by the mesh.",Helmut Pottmann1 & Johannes Wallner,Advances in Computational Mathematics,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-007-9045-4,"Discrete differential geometry,Architectural design,Geometric modeling,Integrable systems,Quadrilateral meshes,Conical meshes,Circular meshes,Offset meshes,Focal meshes"

We study several variants of de Rham cohomology for NC- and NP-schemes.

It turns out that each of these noncommutative variants admits a kind of Hodge decomposition which allows one to express the cohomology groups of a noncommutative scheme Y as a sum of copies of the usual (de Rham, infinitesimal) cohomology groups of the underlying commutative scheme X (Theorems 6.1, 6.4, 6.7).

267,Finite Noncommutative Geometries Related to \(\mathbb {F}_{p}[x]\),"It is known that irreducible noncommutative differential structures over \(\mathbb {F}_{p}[x]\) are classified by irreducible monics m.

This implies that there are \({\frac {p-1}{pd}}{\sum }_{k|d, p\nmid k}\mu _{M}(k)p^{\frac {d}{k}}\) such noncommutative differential structures (μM the Möbius function). Motivated by killing this zero’th cohomology, we consider the directed system of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras \(A_{d}=\mathbb {F}_{p}[x]/(g_{d})\) as well as their inherited bicovariant differential calculi Ω(Ad;m). We show that Ad = Cd ⊗χA1 is a cocycle extension where \(C_{d}=A_{d}^{\psi }\) is the subalgebra of elements fixed under ψ(x) = x + 1. We also have a Frobenius-fixed subalgebra Bd of dimension \(\frac {1}{d} {\sum }_{k | d} \phi (k) p^{\frac {d}{k}}\) (ϕ the Euler totient function), generalising Boolean algebras when p = 2. As special cases, \(A_{1}\cong \mathbb {F}_{p}(\mathbb {Z}/p\mathbb {Z})\), the algebra of functions on the finite group \(\mathbb {Z}/p\mathbb {Z}\), and we show dually that \(\mathbb {F}_{p}\mathbb {Z}/p\mathbb {Z}\cong \mathbb {F}_{p}[L]/(L^{p})\) for a ‘Lie algebra’ generator L with eL group-like, using a truncated exponential. By contrast, A2 over \(\mathbb {F}_{2}\) is a cocycle modification of \(\mathbb {F}_{2}((\mathbb {Z}/2\mathbb {Z})^{2})\) and is a 1-dimensional extension of the Boolean algebra on 3 elements.

Am. Math. soc. 348, 4321–4337 (1996); Abh. Math. Sem. Univ. Hamburg 69, 123–138 (1999); Int. J. Math. 11(7), 911–924 (2000)], Palmer [Remarks on a variation problem in Laguerre geometry. Rendiconti di Mathematica, Serie VII, Roma, vol. 19, pp. 281–293 (1999)] and other authors. In this paper we study Laguerre differential geometry of hypersurfaces in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\). For any umbilical free hypersurface \(x: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}\) with non-zero principal curvatures we define a Laguerre invariant metric g on M and a Laguerre invariant self-adjoint operator \(\mathbb{S}\): TM → TM, and show that \(\{g, \mathbb{S}\}\) is a complete Laguerre invariant system for hypersurfaces in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) with n≥ 4. We calculate the Euler–Lagrange equation for the Laguerre volume functional of Laguerre metric by using Laguerre invariants. Using the Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\), the semi-Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^{n}_{1}\) and the degenerate space \(\mathbb{R}^{n}_{0}\) we define three Laguerre space forms \(U\mathbb{R}^{n}\), \(U\mathbb{R}^{n}_{1}\) and \(U\mathbb{R}^{n}_{0}\) and define the Laguerre embeddings \( U\mathbb{R}^{n}_{1} \rightarrow U \mathbb{R}^{n}\) and \(U\mathbb{R}^{n}_{0} \rightarrow U \mathbb{R}^{n}\), analogously to what happens in the Moebius geometry where we have Moebius space forms S
n, \(\mathbb{H}^{n}\) and \(\mathbb{R}^n\) (spaces of constant curvature) and conformal embeddings \(\mathbb{H}^n \rightarrow S^n\) and \(\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow S^n\) [cf. Liu et al. in Tohoku Math. J. 53, 553–569 (2001) and Wang in Manuscr. Math. 96, 517–534 (1998)]. Using these Laguerre embeddings we can unify the Laguerre geometry of hypersurfaces in \(\mathbb{R}^n\), \(\mathbb{R}^n_1\) and \(\mathbb{R}^n_0\). As an example we show that minimal surfaces in \(\mathbb{R}^3_1\) or \(\mathbb{R}_0^3\) are Laguerre minimal in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).",Tongzhu Li1 & Changping Wang,manuscripta mathematica,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00229-006-0058-y,"Primary 53A40,Secondary 53B25"
276,Minimal and maximal extensions of M-hypoelliptic proper uniform pseudo-differential operators in \(L^p\)-spaces on non-compact manifolds,"In the context of manifolds of bounded geometry, we show that the properties of proper uniform pseudo-differential operators (PUPDOs) constructed by Kordyukov, Meladze, and Shubin carry over to PUPDOs whose local representations have symbols belonging to the (weighted) class \(M_{\rho ,\varLambda }^{m}\) introduced by Garello and Morando. Under the M-ellipticity assumption, we show that the minimal and maximal extensions of such PUPDOs in the \(L^p\)-spaces, where \(1<p<\infty \), coincide.","Ognjen Milatovic

277,Spinc geometry of Kähler manifolds and the Hodge Laplacian on minimal Lagrangian submanifolds,"From the existence of parallel spinor fields on Calabi-Yau, hyper-Kähler or complex flat manifolds, we deduce the existence of harmonic differential forms of different degrees on their minimal Lagrangian submanifolds. In particular, when the submanifolds are compact, we obtain sharp estimates on their Betti numbers which generalize those obtained by Smoczyk in [49]. When the ambient manifold is Kähler-Einstein with positive scalar curvature, and especially if it is a complex contact manifold or the complex projective space, we prove the existence of Kählerian Killing spinor fields for some particular spinc structures. Using these fields, we construct eigenforms for the Hodge Laplacian on certain minimal Lagrangian submanifolds and give some estimates for their spectra. These results also generalize some theorems by Smoczyk in [50]. Finally, applications on the Morse index of minimal Lagrangian submanifolds are obtained.","O. Hijazi1, S. Montiel2 & F.

281,“Local–Global”: the first twenty years,"This paper investigates how and when pairs of terms such as “local–global” and “im Kleinen–im Grossen” began to be used by mathematicians as explicit reflexive categories. A first phase of automatic search led to the delineation of the relevant corpus, and to the identification of the period from 1898 to 1918 as that of emergence. The emergence appears to have been, from the very start, both transdisciplinary (function theory, calculus of variations, differential geometry) and international, although the AMS-Göttingen connection played a specific part. First used as an expository and didactic tool (e.g. by Osgood), it soon played a crucial part in the creation of new mathematical concepts (e.g. in Hahn’s work), in the shaping of research agendas (e.g. Blaschke’s global differential geometry), and in Weyl’s axiomatic foundation of the manifold concept. We finally turn to France, where in the 1910s, in the wake of Poincaré’s work, Hadamard began to promote a research agenda in terms of “passage du local au general.”",Renaud Chorlay,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-010-0070-1,"Riemann Surface,Mathematical Text,Complex Function Theory,Analysis Situs,Fonctions Analytiques"

303,"Laguerre minimal surfaces, isotropic geometry and linear elasticity","Laguerre minimal (L-minimal) surfaces are the minimizers of the energy \(\int (H^2-K)/K d\!A\). They are a Laguerre geometric counterpart of Willmore surfaces, the minimizers of \(\int (H^2-K)d\!A\), which are known to be an entity of Möbius sphere geometry. The present paper provides a new and simple approach to L-minimal surfaces by showing that they appear as graphs of biharmonic functions in the isotropic model of Laguerre geometry. Therefore, L-minimal surfaces are equivalent to Airy stress surfaces of linear elasticity. In particular, there is a close relation between L-minimal surfaces of the spherical type, isotropic minimal surfaces (graphs of harmonic functions), and Euclidean minimal surfaces. This relation exhibits connections to geometrical optics. In this paper we also address and illustrate the computation of L-minimal surfaces via thin plate splines and numerical solutions of biharmonic equations. Finally, metric duality in isotropic space is used to derive an isotropic counterpart to L-minimal surfaces and certain Lie transforms of L-minimal surfaces in Euclidean space. The latter surfaces possess an optical interpretation as anticaustics of graph surfaces of biharmonic functions.","Helmut Pottmann1, Philipp Grohs1 & Niloy J.

First, differential equations of the movement should be derived. Then we pass to the difference scheme and define the iteration algorithm. There is a wide class of optimization methods constructed in such a way. One of the most known representatives of this class is the heavy ball method. As a rule, such type of algorithms includes parameters that highly affect the convergence rate. In this paper, the charged ball method, belonging to this class, is proposed and investigated. It is a new effective optimization method that allows solving some computational geometry problems. A problem of orthogonal projection of a point onto a convex closed set with a smooth boundary and the problem of finding the minimum distance between two such sets are considered in detail.

This is an initial work of transport information geometry. Our investigation starts with the probability simplex (probability manifold) supported on vertices of a finite graph. The main idea is to embed the probability manifold as a submanifold of the positive measure space with a weighted graph Laplacian operator. By this viewpoint, we establish torsion–free Christoffel symbols, Levi–Civita connections, curvature tensors and volume forms in the probability manifold by Euclidean coordinates. As a consequence, the Jacobi equation, Laplace-Beltrami, Hessian operators and diffusion processes on the probability manifold are derived. These geometric computations are also provided in the infinite-dimensional density space (density manifold) supported on a finite-dimensional manifold. In particular, we present an identity connecting among Baker–Émery \(\Gamma _2\) operator (carré du champ itéré), Fisher–Rao metric and optimal transport metric.

309,Combinatorial principles in stochastic geometry in the plane: A review,"The paper contains a review of the main results of Yerevan research group in planar stochastic geometry, in particular the second order random geometrical processes using the methods of integration of combinatorial decompositions and invariant imbedding. For the present review we have chosen the results concerning tomography (or stereology) of random processes of lines, random tessellations (mosaics) and Boolean models (not necessarily Poisson) in the plane. The results are obtained either under the assumption of invariance with respect to the group T of translations, or the group M of the Euclidean motions of ℝ2. In each case the marked point processes {P

i
,Ψ
i
} of intersections induced by the random pattern in question on the test lines are studied, where {P

i
} is the point process of intersections induced on a test line of direction α, the mark Ψ
i
 is the angle at which the intersection with the test line of direction α occurs at point P

i
. In the case of random line processes, these approaches lead to differential relations between the joint probabilities for the numbers of intersections that occur in disjoint intervals on a test line having direction α, and the first and the second order Palm probabilities of the similar events. By an analysis of these relations, conditions of Poissonity of n-dimensional distributions for any n ≥ 1 are derived. In the case of random tessellations the distribution of the length of so-called typical edge of direction α is obtained in terms of the probability distribution of the corresponding {P

}. As regards random M-invariant Boolean models, the present review includes a description of the method based on summation of Pleijel-type identities for the part of the realization within a finite disc and subsequent calculation of the limit when the radius of the disc tends to infinity. An alternating process of marked intervals on a line is called black-recurrent if the black marked intervals are independent and the lengths of the white intervals constitute an independent sequence of independent random variables. One of the earliest results in the field states that black-recurrence implies an exponential distribution for the length of the typical white interval on a test line.",V. K.

310,Generalization of log-aesthetic curves via similarity geometry,"The class of log-aesthetic curves includes the logarithmic spiral, clothoid, and involute of a circle. Although most of these curves are expressed only by an integral form of the tangent vector, it is possible to interactively generate and deform them, thereby presenting many applications in industrial and graphic design. The use of the log-aesthetic curves in practical design, however, is still limited. Therefore, we should extend its formula to obtain curves that solve various practical design problems such as \(G^n\) Hermite interpolation, deformation, smoothing, data-point fitting, and blending plural curves. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to representing log-aesthetic curves via similarity geometry. In turn, this research provides a unified framework for various studies on log-aesthetic curves, particularly of log-aesthetic curve formulation.","Jun-ichi Inoguchi1, Rushan Ziatdinov2 & Kenjiro T.

Two cases are considered, regarding the total number of the roots, which act as numerical attractors. For both cases we use the iterative schemes for performing a thorough and systematic classification of the nodes on the complex plane. The distributions of the required iterations as well as the probability and their correlations with the corresponding basins of convergence are also discussed. Our numerical calculations suggest that most of the iterative schemes provide relatively similar convergence structures on the complex plane. In addition, several aspects of the numerical methods are compared in an attempt to obtain general conclusions regarding their speed and efficiency. Moreover, we try to determine how the complexity of the each case influences the main characteristics of the numerical methods.","Euaggelos E.

324,"Spectrum of the Koopman Operator, Spectral Expansions in Functional Spaces, and State-Space Geometry","We examine spectral operator-theoretic properties of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems with globally stable attractors. Using the Kato decomposition, we develop a spectral expansion for general linear autonomous dynamical systems with analytic observables and define the notion of generalized eigenfunctions of the associated Koopman operator. We interpret stable, unstable and center subspaces in terms of zero-level sets of generalized eigenfunctions. We then utilize conjugacy properties of Koopman eigenfunctions and the new notion of open eigenfunctions—defined on subsets of state space—to extend these results to nonlinear dynamical systems with an equilibrium. We provide a characterization of (global) center manifolds, center-stable, and center-unstable manifolds in terms of joint zero-level sets of families of Koopman operator eigenfunctions associated with the nonlinear system. After defining a new class of Hilbert spaces, that capture the on- and off-attractor properties of dissipative dynamics, and introducing the concept of modulated Fock spaces, we develop spectral expansions for a class of dynamical systems possessing globally stable limit cycles and limit tori, with observables that are square-integrable in on-attractor variables and analytic in off-attractor variables. We discuss definitions of stable, unstable, and global center manifolds in such nonlinear systems with (quasi)-periodic attractors in terms of zero-level sets of Koopman operator eigenfunctions. We define the notion of isostables for a general class of nonlinear systems. In contrast with the systems that have discrete Koopman operator spectrum, we provide a simple example of a measure-preserving system that is not chaotic but has continuous spectrum, and discuss experimental observations of spectrum on such systems. We also provide a brief characterization of the data types corresponding to the obtained theoretical results and define the coherent principal dimension for a class of datasets based on the lattice-type principal spectrum of the associated Koopman operator.","Igor Mezić

329,How Many Structure Constants do Exist in Riemannian Geometry?,"After reading such a question, any mathematician or physicist will say that, according to a well known result of L.P. Eisenhart found in 1926, the answer is surely ”One”, namely the constant allowing to describe the so-called “ constant Riemannian curvature ” condition. The purpose of this paper is to prove the contrary by studying the case of two dimensional Riemannian geometry in the light of an old work of E. Vessiot published in 1903 but still totally unknown today after more than a century. In fact, we shall compute locally the Vessiot structure equations and prove that there are indeed “ Two ” Vessiot structure constants satisfying a single linear Jacobi condition showing that one of them must vanish while the other one must be equal to the known one or that both must be equal. This result depends on deep mathematical reasons in the formal theory of Lie pseudogroups, involving both the Spencer \(\delta \)-cohomology and diagram chasing in homological algebra. Another similar example will illustrate and justify this comment out of the classical tensorial framework of the famous “ equivalence problem ”. The case of contact transformations will also be studied. Though it is quite unexpected, we shall reach the conclusion that the mathematical foundations of both classical and conformal Riemannian geometry must be revisited. We have treated the case of conformal geometry and its application in recent papers (Pommaret in J Mod Phys 12:829–858, 2021. https://doi.org/10.4236/jmp.2020.1110104; The conformal group revisited. arxiv:2006.03449; Nonlinear conformal electromagnetism. arxiv:2007.01710).","J.-F.

331,The information geometry of two-field functional integrals,"Two-field functional integrals (2FFI) are an important class of solution methods for generating functions of dissipative processes, including discrete-state stochastic processes, dissipative dynamical systems, and decohering quantum densities. The stationary trajectories of these integrals describe a conserved current by Liouville’s theorem, despite the absence of a conserved kinematic phase space current in the underlying stochastic process. We develop the information geometry of generating functions for discrete-state classical stochastic processes in the Doi-Peliti 2FFI form, and exhibit two quantities conserved along stationary trajectories. One is a Wigner function, familiar as a semiclassical density from quantum-mechanical time-dependent density-matrix methods. The second is an overlap function, between directions of variation in an underlying distribution and those in the directions of relative large-deviation probability that can be used to interrogate the distribution, and expressed as an inner product of vector fields in the Fisher information metric. To give an interpretation to the time invertibility implied by current conservation, we use generating functions to represent importance sampling protocols, and show that the conserved Fisher information is the differential of a sample volume under deformations of the nominal distribution and the likelihood ratio. We derive a pair of dual affine connections particular to Doi-Peliti theory for the way they separate the roles of the nominal distribution and likelihood ratio, distinguishing them from the standard dually-flat connection of Nagaoka and Amari defined on the importance distribution, and show that dual flatness in the affine coordinates of the coherent-state basis captures the special role played by coherent states in Doi-Peliti theory.","Eric Smith

The results show that for codimension 1 singularities, there are two generic singularity types for general solutions, and only one generic singularity type if there is a certain symmetry present. The analysis depends on a special choice of coordinates, which greatly simplifies the equations, showing that the type is exactly that of one dimensional Legendrian singularities, generalized so that the velocity can be infinite at the singularity. The solution is viewed as a surface in an appropriate compactified jet space. Smoothness of the solution surface is proved using the Cauchy-Kowalewski Theorem, which also shows that these singularity types are realizable. Numerical results from a special, highly accurate numerical method demonstrate the validity of this geometric analysis. A new analysis of general Legendrian singularities with blowup, i.e., at which the derivative may be infinite, is also presented, using projective coordinates.","Russel E.

342,A Transcendence Basis in the Differential Field of Invariants of Pseudo-Galilean Group,"Let G be a subgroup in the group of all invertible linear transformations of a finite-dimensional real space X. One of the problems in differential geometry is that of finding easily verified necessary and sufficient conditions for G-equivalence of paths in X. In solving this problem, we use methods of the theory of differential invariants which give descriptions of transcendence bases of differential fields of G-invariant differential rational functions. Having explicit forms of transcendence bases, we can obtain efficient criteria for G-equivalence of paths with respect to actions of the special linear, orthogonal, pseudoorthogonal, and symplectic groups. We present a description of one finite transcendence basis in the differential field of differential rational functions invariant with respect to the action of the pseudo-Galilean group ΓO.

344,"K-area, Hofer metric and geometry of conjugacy classes in Lie groups","Given a closed symplectic manifold (M,ω) we introduce a certain quantity associated to a tuple of conjugacy classes in the universal cover of the group Ham (M,ω) by means of the Hofer metric on Ham (M,ω). We use pseudo-holomorphic curves involved in the definition of the multiplicative structure on the Floer cohomology of a symplectic manifold (M,ω) to estimate this quantity in terms of actions of some periodic orbits of related Hamiltonian flows. As a corollary we get a new way to obtain Agnihotri-Belkale-Woodward inequalities for eigenvalues of products of unitary matrices. As another corollary we get a new proof of the geodesic property (with respect to the Hofer metric) of Hamiltonian flows generated by certain autonomous Hamiltonians. Our main technical tool is K-area defined for Hamiltonian fibrations over a surface with boundary in the spirit of L. Polterovich’s work on Hamiltonian fibrations over S

In this paper we construct explicit solutions of the unregularized equation and suggest candidates for its weak solutions.

The stationary solutions of this equation include the minimizers of a free energy, and we show these minimizers are remarkably well-approximated by a second-order ``self-dual'' equation. Moreover, the self-dual solutions give upper bounds for the free energy which imply the existence of weak limits for the asymptotic minimizers. In certain cases, some recent results of Jin and Kohn [28] combined with these upper bounds enable us to demonstrate that the energy of the asymptotic minimizers converges to that of the self-dual solutions in a viscosity limit.","N.

Using these Moebius invariants we calculate the first variation of the moebius volume functional. We show that any minimal surface in ?n is also Moebius minimal and that the image in ?n of any minimal surface in ℝn unter the inverse of a stereographic projection is  also Moebius minimal. Finally we use the relations between Moebius invariants to classify all surfaces in ?3 with vanishing Moebius form.

377,Spectral Approximation of Partial Differential Equations in Highly Distorted Domains,"In this paper we discuss spectral approximations of the Poisson equation in deformed quadrilateral domains. High order polynomial approximations are used for both the solution and the representation of the geometry. Following an isoparametric approach, the four edges of the computational domain are first parametrized using high order polynomial interpolation. Transfinite interpolation is then used to construct the mapping from the square reference domain to the physical domain. Through a series of numerical examples we show the importance of representing the boundary of the domain in a careful way; the choice of interpolation points along the edges of the physical domain may significantly effect the overall discretization error. One way to ensure good interpolation points along an edge is based on the following criteria: (i) the points should be on the exact curve; (ii) the derivative of the exact curve and the interpolant should coincide at the internal points along the edge. Following this approach, we demonstrate that the discretization error for the Poisson problem may decay exponentially fast even when the boundary has low regularity.","Tormod Bjøntegaard1, Einar M.

For compact multiply connected surfaces the charge transported around the “holes” is related to the first Chern character of spectral bundles. For noncompact surfaces the charge transported to infinity is related to the index of a certain Fredholm operator which involves the comparison of appropriate spectral projections.

We extend this classical result to the framework of Information Geometry. In particular, we prove that the rays of level-sets defined by a pseudo-distance are generated by the sum of two tangent vectors. By relying on these vectors, we propose a novel definition of a canonical divergence and its dual function. We prove that the new divergence allows to recover a given dual structure \((\mathrm{g},\nabla ,\nabla ^*)\) of a dually convex set on a smooth manifold \(\mathrm {M}\). Additionally, we show that this divergence coincides with the canonical divergence proposed by Ay and Amari in the case of: (a) self-duality, (b) dual flatness, (c) statistical geometric analogue of the concept of symmetric spaces in Riemannian geometry. For a dually convex set, the case (c) leads to a further comparison of the new divergence with the one introduced by Henmi and Kobayashi.","Domenico Felice

As also shown, one can construct in such a singular context a de Rham cohomology, as well as a short exponential sequence, both of which are fundamental in differential geometry. In this paper, these results are significantly strengthened, motivated by the so-called space-time foam structures in general relativity, where singularities can be dense. In fact, this time one can deal with singularities on arbitrary sets, provided that their complementaries are dense, as well. In particular, the cardinal of the set of singularities can be larger than that of the nonsingular points.",Anastasios Mallios1 & Elemer E.

In higher dimensions, we provide topological obstructions for a minimal hypersurface in Rn+1 to admit an essential positive supersolution. This immediately yields information about the Gauss map of complete minimal hypersurfaces in Rn+1.

∞ (a) in phase space, which becomes the central object of study. This basic curve, which replaces the simple parabolic shape typical of many analogous first-order models, may have a complicated geometrical structure. As the parametera increases,C
∞(a) undergoes transformations characterized by the dynamical descriptions: stable node→stable focus→stable limit cycle →chaotic attractor. Although the limited characterization ofchaos by the appearance of nonperiodic solutions and solutions of arbitrarily large period is relied upon, this appears to be only a simplified approximation of the real behavior of solutions. Trajectories (x
n, xn+1),n=0,1,…, are calculated using the related nonlinear planar mapT
a(x,y)=(y,ay(1−x)), and regions of persistence and escape are described for characteristic values ofa. The study of persistence, of even more fundamental interest than the associated problems of periodicity and stability, receives special attention. We introduce a geometrical model, similar in many respects to that for the well-known analoguex
n+1=axn(1−x

397,Mathematical Modeling of Axonal Formation Part I: Geometry,"A stochastic model is proposed for the position of the tip of an axon. Parameters in the model are determined from laboratory data. The first step is the reduction of inherent error in the laboratory data, followed by estimating parameters and fitting a mathematical model to this data. Several axonogenesis aspects have been investigated, particularly how positive axon elongation and growth cone kinematics are coupled processes but require very different theoretical descriptions. Preliminary results have been obtained through a series of experiments aimed at isolating the response of axons to controlled gradient exposures to guidance cues and the effects of ethanol and similar substances. We show results based on the following tasks; (A) development of a novel filtering strategy to obtain data sets truly representative of the axon trail formation; (B) creation of a coarse graining method which establishes (C) an optimal parameter estimation technique, and (D) derivation of a mathematical model which is stochastic in nature, parameterized by arc length. The framework and the resulting model allow for the comparison of experimental and theoretical mean square displacement (MSD) of the developing axon. Current results are focused on uncovering the geometric characteristics of the axons and MSD through analytical solutions and numerical simulations parameterized by arc length, thus ignoring the temporal growth processes. Future developments will capture the dynamic growth cone and how it behaves as a function of time. Qualitative and quantitative predictions of the model at specific length scales capture the experimental behavior well.","Yanthe E. Pearson1, Emilio Castronovo2, Tara A. Lindsley3 & …Donald A.

That is, for any initial condition, one tries to find a control that drives the point to this target trajectory in the cheapest way. We consider the inverted pendulum on a moving cart as an ideal example to investigate the solution structure of a nonlinear optimal control problem. Since the dimension of the pendulum system is small, it is possible to use illustrations that enhance the understanding of the geometry of the solution set. We are interested in the value function, that is, the optimal cost associated with each initial condition, as well as the control input that achieves this optimum. We consider different representations of the value function by including both globally and locally optimal solutions.

A main motivation for these algebras comes from the so called space-time foam structures in General Relativity, where the set of singularities can be dense. A variety of applications of these algebras have been presented elsewhere, including in de Rham cohomology, Abstract Differential Geometry, Quantum Gravity, etc. Here a global Cauchy-Kovalevskaia theorem is presented for arbitrary analytic nonlinear systems of PDEs. The respective global generalized solutions are analytic on the whole of the domain of the equations considered, except for singularity sets which are closed and nowhere dense, and which upon convenience can be chosen to have zero Lebesgue measure.In view of the severe limitations due to the polynomial type growth conditions in the definition of Colombeau algebras, the class of singularities such algebras can deal with is considerably limited.

402,"Noncommutative geometry, dynamics, and ∞-adic Arakelov geometry
","
In Arakelov theory a completion of an arithmetic surface is
achieved by enlarging the group of divisors by formal linear
combinations of the “closed fibers at infinity”. Manin described
the dual graph of any such closed fiber in terms of an infinite
tangle of bounded geodesics in a hyperbolic handlebody endowed
with a Schottky uniformization. In this paper we consider
arithmetic surfaces over the ring of integers in a number field,
with fibers of genus 
g ≥ 2. 
We use Connes’ theory of spectral
triples to relate the hyperbolic geometry of the handlebody to
Deninger’s archimedean  cohomology and the cohomology of the cone
of the local monodromy 
N at arithmetic infinity as introduced by
the first author of this paper. First, we consider derived (cohomological)
spectral data 
\(A, H^{\cdot}(X^*), \Phi\),
where the algebra
is obtained from the SL
(2, ℝ) action on the cohomology of the cone, induced by the
presence of a polarized Lefschetz module structure, and its
restriction to the group ring of a Fuchsian Schottky group. In this
setting we recover the alternating product of the archimedean
factors from a zeta function of a spectral triple. Then, we
introduce a different construction, which is related to Manin’s
description of the dual graph of the fiber at infinity. We provide a
geometric model for the dual graph as the mapping torus of a dynamical
system T on a Cantor set. 
We consider a noncommutative space which
describes the action of the Schottky group on its limit set and
parameterizes the ‘‘components of the closed fiber at infinity’’.
This can be identified with a Cuntz-Krieger algebra 
\({\mathcal O}_A\)
associated to a subshift of finite type. We construct a spectral
triple for this noncommutative space, via a representation on the
cochains of a ‘‘dynamical cohomology’’, defined in terms
of the tangle of bounded geodesics in the handlebody. In both
constructions presented in the paper, the Dirac operator agrees with
the grading operator Φ that represents the ‘‘logarithm of a
Frobenius-type operator’’ on the archimedean  cohomology. In fact,
the archimedean  cohomology embeds in the dynamical
cohomology, compatibly with the action of a real Frobenius 
\(\bar F_\infty,\)
so that the local factor can again be recovered from these
data. The duality isomorphism on the cohomology of the cone of 
N
corresponds to the pairing of dynamical homology and cohomology. 
This suggests the existence of a duality between the monodromy 
N and the
dynamical map 1-T. 
Moreover, the ‘‘reduction mod infinity’’ is
described in terms of the homotopy quotient associated to the
noncommutative space 
\({\mathcal O}_A\)
 and the μ-map of
Baum-Connes. The geometric model of the dual graph can also be
described as a homotopy quotient.

Recently the space-time foam differential algebras of generalized functions with dense singularities were introduced, motivated by the so called space-time foam structures in General Relativity with dense singularities, and by Quantum Gravity. A variety of applications of these algebras has been presented, among them, a global Cauchy-Kovalevskaia theorem, de Rham cohomology in abstract differential geometry, and so on. So far the space-time foam algebras have only been constructed on Euclidean spaces. In this paper, owing to their relevance in General Relativity among others, the construction of these algebras is extended to arbitrary finite dimensional smooth manifolds. Since these algebras contain the Schwartz distributions, the extension of their construction to manifolds also solves the long outstanding problem of defining distributions on manifolds, and doing so in ways compatible with nonlinear operations. Earlier, similar attempts were made in the literature with respect to the extension of the Colombeau algebras to manifolds, algebras which also contain the distributions. These attempts have encountered significant technical difficulties, owing to the growth condition type limitations the elements of Colombeau algebras have to satisfy near singularities. Since in this paper no any type of such or other growth conditions are required in the construction of space-time foam algebras, their extension to manifolds proceeds in a surprisingly easy and natural way. It is also shown that the space-time foam algebras form a fine and flabby sheaf, properties which are important in securing a considerably large class of singularities which generalized functions can handle.

407,A Geometry Model for the Simulation of Drug Diffusion through the Stratum Corneum,"We present a three-dimensional geometry model with tetrakaidecahedra for the biphasic model stratum corneum (SC) membrane ΩSC consisting of corneocytes embedded in a lipid matrix. Two practical domains for ΩSC are realized: the simple model SC-membrane ΩsSC and a realistic model SC-membrane ΩrSC with dimensions for abdominal human SC. The new geometry model uses tetrakaidecahedra as basic units. It is possible to assemble the tetrakaidecahedra one upon the other and side by side without gaps in a densest packing and with minimal area for all required interfaces. Geometric characteristics such as length, depth, height and angles of the corneocytes as well as the thickness of the lipid channels can be chosen arbitrarily. Furthermore, we are able to control the shift of the corneocytes and our concept allows to assemble many corneocytes in rows, columns and layers all embedded in a lipid matrix. With the aid of this concept the non-steady-state problem of drug diffusion within a three-dimensional, biphasic model SC-membrane, such as ΩsSC or ΩrSC, having homogeneous lipid and corneocyte phases is solved numerically with a multigrid method. The numerical computations are done with our simulation system UG. Our method for solving the diffusion problem is validated with homogeneous model SC-membranes with varying size of corneocytes and lipid channels, different numbers of corneocytes, and corneocyte alignment. Several time-dependent drug concentration profiles within the heterogeneous model SC-membranes are calculated and graphically shown for different values of relative corneocyte permeability ɛ  = D

409,Information geometry for phylogenetic trees,"We propose a new space of phylogenetic trees which we call wald space. The motivation is to develop a space suitable for statistical analysis of phylogenies, but with a geometry based on more biologically principled assumptions than existing spaces: in wald space, trees are close if they induce similar distributions on genetic sequence data. As a point set, wald space contains the previously developed Billera–Holmes–Vogtmann (BHV) tree space; it also contains disconnected forests, like the edge-product (EP) space but without certain singularities of the EP space. We investigate two related geometries on wald space. The first is the geometry of the Fisher information metric of character distributions induced by the two-state symmetric Markov substitution process on each tree. Infinitesimally, the metric is proportional to the Kullback–Leibler divergence, or equivalently, as we show, to any f-divergence. The second geometry is obtained analogously but using a related continuous-valued Gaussian process on each tree, and it can be viewed as the trace metric of the affine-invariant metric for covariance matrices. We derive a gradient descent algorithm to project from the ambient space of covariance matrices to wald space. For both geometries we derive computational methods to compute geodesics in polynomial time and show numerically that the two information geometries (discrete and continuous) are very similar. In particular, geodesics are approximated extrinsically. Comparison with the BHV geometry shows that our canonical and biologically motivated space is substantially different.","M. K. Garba1,2, T. M.

410,Every conformal class contains a metric of bounded geometry,"We show that on every manifold, every conformal class of semi-Riemannian metrics contains a metric \(g\) such that each \(k\)th-order covariant derivative of the Riemann tensor of \(g\) has bounded absolute value \(a_k\). This result is new also in the Riemannian case, where one can arrange in addition that \(g\) is complete with injectivity and convexity radius \(\ge \)1. One can even make the radii rapidly increasing and the functions \(a_k\) rapidly decreasing at infinity. We prove generalizations to foliated manifolds, where curvature, second fundamental form and injectivity radius of the leaves can be controlled similarly. Still more generally, we introduce the notion of a “flatzoomer”: a quantity that involves arbitrary geometric structures and behaves suitably with respect to modifications by a function, e.g. a conformal factor. The results on bounded geometry follow from a general theorem about flatzoomers, which might be applicable in many other geometric contexts involving noncompact manifolds.",Olaf Müller1 & Marc Nardmann2 nAff,Mathematische Annalen,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00208-014-1162-z,"Primary 53C20,53A30,53C50,53C12,53C22,Secondary 53C15"

414,Qualitative properties and approximation of solutions of Bingham flows: On the stabilization for large time and the geometry of the support,"We study the transient flow of an isothermal and incompressible Bingham fluID. Similar models arise in completely different contexts as, for instance, in material science, image processing and differential geometry. For the two-dimensional flow in a bounded domain we show the extinction in a finite time even under suitable nonzero external forces. We also consIDer the special case of a threedimensional domain given as an infinitely long cylinder of bounded cross section. We give sufficient conditions leading to a scalar formulation on the cross section. We prove the stabilization of solutions, when t goes to infinity, to the solution \( u_\infty \)
 of the associated stationary problem, once we assume a suitable convergence on the right hand forcing term. We give some sufficient conditions for the extinction in a finite time of solutions of the scalar problem. We show that, at least under radially symmetric conditions, when the stationary state is not trivial, \( u_\infty \ne 0 \)
, there are cases in which the stabilization to the stationary solution needs an infinite time to take place. We end the paper with some numerical experiences on the scalar formulation. In particular, some of those experiences exhibit an instantaneous change of topology of the support of the solution: when the support of the initial datum is formed by two disjoint balls, but closed enough, then, instantaneously, for any t > 0, the support of the solution u( ·, t) becomes a connected set. Some other numerical experiences are devoted to the study of the “profile” of the solution and its extinction time.","Jesús Ildefonso Díaz1,2, Roland Glowinski3,5, Giovanna GuIDoboni3,4 & …Taebeom Kim","RACSAM - Revista de la Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas, Fisicas y Naturales.

417,Nonlinear feedback control and systems of partial differential equations,"Finding an equivalence between two feedback control systems is treated as a problem in the theory of partial differential equation systems. The mathematical aim is to embed the Jakubzyk-Respondek, Hunt-Meyer-Su work on feedback linearization in the general theory of differential systems due to Lie, Cartan, Vessiot, Spencer, and Goldschmidt. We do this by using the functor taking control systems into differential systems, and studying the equivalence invariants of such differential systems. After discussing the general case, attention is focussed on the special situation of most immediate practical importance, the theory of feedback linearization. In this case, the general system for feedback equivalence becomes a system of linear partial differential equations. Conditions are found that the general solution of this system may be described in terms of a Frobenius system and certain differential-algebraic operations.",Robert Hermann,Acta Applicandae Mathematica,1989,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00052493,"58A30,93C15"

421,Noncommutative geometry and classification of elliptic operators,"The computation of a stable homotopic classification of elliptic operators is an important problem of elliptic theory. The classical solution of this problem is given by Atiyah and Singer for the case of smooth compact manifolds. It is formulated in terms of K-theory for a cotangent fibering of the given manifold. It cannot be extended for the case of nonsmooth manifolds because their cotangent fiberings do not contain all necessary information. Another Atiyah definition might fit in such a case: it is based on the concept of abstract elliptic operators and is given in term of K-homologies of the manifold itself (instead of its fiberings). Indeed, this theorem is recently extended for manifolds with conic singularities, ribs, and general so-called stratified manifolds: it suffices just to replace the phrase “smooth manifold” by the phrase “stratified manifold” (of the corresponding class). Thus, stratified manifolds is a strange phenomenon in a way: the algebra of symbols of differential (pseudodifferential) operators is quite noncommutative on such manifolds (the symbol components corresponding to strata of positive codimensions are operator-valued functions), but the solution of the classification problem can be found in purely geometric terms. In general, it is impossible for other classes of nonsmooth manifolds. In particular, the authors recently found that, for manifolds with angles, the classification is given by a K-group of a noncommutative C* -algebra and it cannot be reduced to a commutative algebra if normal fiberings of faces of the considered manifold are nontrivial. Note that the proofs are based on noncommutative geometry (more exactly, the K-theory of C* -algebras) even in the case of stratified manifolds though the results are “classical.” In this paper, we provide a review of the abovementioned classification results for elliptic operators on manifolds with singularities and corresponding methods of noncommutative geometry (in particular, the localization principle in C* -algebras).","V.

427,Riemannian Geometry of the Contactomorphism Group,"Given an odd-dimensional compact manifold and a contact form, we consider the group of contact transformations of the manifold (contactomorphisms) and the subgroup of those transformations that precisely preserve the contact form (quantomorphisms). If the manifold also has a Riemannian metric, we can consider the \(L^2\) inner product of vector fields on it, which by restriction gives an inner product on the tangent space at the identity of each of the groups that we consider. We then obtain right-invariant metrics on both the contactomorphism and quantomorphism groups. We show that the contactomorphism group has geodesics at least for short time and that the quantomorphism group is a totally geodesic subgroup of it. Furthermore we show that the geodesics in this smaller group exist globally. Our methodology is to use the right invariance to derive an “Euler–Arnold” equation from the geodesic equation and to show using ODE methods that it has solutions which depend smoothly on the initial conditions. For global existence we then derive a “quasi-Lipschitz” estimate on the stream function, which leads to a Beale–Kato–Majda criterion which is automatically satisfied for quantomorphisms.

The utility of the h-twistor concept, which is a generalization of the idea of a Penrose twistor to a pseudo-Euclidean space of arbitrary signature, is amply demonstrated in a new treatment of the Schwarzian derivative.",José María Pozo1 & Garret Sobczyk,Acta Applicandae Mathematica,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1015256913414,"affine geometry,Clifford algebra,conformal group,Euclidean geometry,geometric algebra,Grassmann algebra,horosphere,Lie algebra,linear algebra,Möbius transformation,non-Euclidean geometry,null cone,projective geometry,spectral decomposition,Schwarzian derivative,twistor"

435,Compressibility effects on outflows in a two-fluid system. 2. Point source in spherical geometry,"Fluid outflow from a point source into a surrounding fluid of different density is considered. A sharp interface separates the two fluids, and its mean radius increases with time due to the mass produced by the source. The inner fluid is incompressible and inviscid, but the outer fluid is weakly compressible and is modelled using a Boussinesq approximation. A linearized theory is presented, and it assumes that disturbances to the overall outflow remain small in amplitude. A spectral scheme for solving the non-linear problem is discussed. The results demonstrate that compressibility acts to suppress the Rayleigh–Taylor type instability of the interface, which would occur if both fluids were incompressible. In addition, the compressibility of the outer fluid forces the source within the inner incompressible fluid to behave in a more complicated manner while still preserving the overall ejected mass flux. This is confirmed in both the linearized and non-linear solutions.",Lawrence K. Forbes1 & Oliver A.

436,The geometry of Gauss map and shape operator in simply isotropic and pseudo-isotropic spaces,"In this work, we are interested in the differential geometry of surfaces in simply isotropic \({\mathbb {I}}^3\) and pseudo-isotropic \({\mathbb {I}}_{\mathrm {p}}^3\) spaces, which consists of the study of \({\mathbb {R}}^3\) equipped with a degenerate metric such as \(\mathrm {d}s^2=\mathrm {d}x^2\pm \mathrm {d}y^2\). The investigation is based on previous results in the simply isotropic space (Pavković in Glas Mat Ser III 15:149–152, 1980; Rad JAZU 450:129–137, 1990), which point to the possibility of introducing an isotropic Gauss map taking values on a unit sphere of parabolic type and of defining a shape operator from it, whose determinant and trace give the known relative Gaussian and mean curvatures, respectively. Based on the isotropic Gauss map, a new notion of connection is also introduced, the relative connection (r-connection, for short). We show that the new curvature tensor in both \({\mathbb {I}}^3\) and \({\mathbb {I}}_{\mathrm {p}}^3\) does not vanish identically and is directly related to the relative Gaussian curvature. We also compute the Gauss and Codazzi–Mainardi equations for the r-connection and show that r-geodesics on spheres of parabolic type are obtained via intersections with planes passing through their center (focus). Finally, we show that admissible pseudo-isotropic surfaces are timelike and that their shape operator may fail to be diagonalizable, in analogy to Lorentzian geometry. We also prove that the only totally umbilical surfaces in \({\mathbb {I}}_{\mathrm {p}}^3\) are planes and spheres of parabolic type and that, in contrast to the r-connection, the curvature tensor associated with the isotropic Levi-Civita connection vanishes identically for any pseudo-isotropic surface, as also happens in simply isotropic space.",Luiz C.

In many cases every Kähler class is admissible. In particular, our results complete the classification of extremal Kähler metrics on geometrically ruled surfaces, answering several long-standing questions.We also find that our characterization agrees with a notion of K-stability for admissible Kähler classes. Our examples and nonexistence results therefore provide a fertile testing ground for the rapidly developing theory of stability for projective varieties, and we discuss some of the ramifications. In particular we obtain examples of projective varieties which are destabilized by a non-algebraic degeneration. ","Vestislav Apostolov1,2, David M.J. Calderbank3, Paul Gauduchon4 & …Christina W.

We show that for general conformally invariant m-Laplace operators L (including the GJMS operators), this mass is a conformal invariant in the case that the dimension of M is odd and that \(\ker L = 0\), and we give a precise description of the failure of the conformal invariance in the case that these conditions are not satisfied.",Matthias Ludewig,Annals of Global Analysis and Geometry,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10455-017-9556-2,"Laplace type operator,Elliptic operator,Green’s function,Zeta function,Heat kernel,Conformal geometry,Positive mass"

We show that algorithms that follow the primal—dual central path are in some sense close to optimal.

The fundamental theorem in this field is the result that a Desarguesian straightG-space in which the parallel axiom holds and the spheres are convex is Minkowskian. However the question as to whether the hypothesis of the space being Desarguesian is necessary or not has remained unsolved for over forty years. It is therefore natural to investigate conditions stronger than the mere convexity of spheres. In this paper such geometric conditions derived from functions which measure the distance between lines and points on lines are studied. Besides characterising the Minkowskian spaces these investigations also bring out the interplay between the parallel axiom and the convexity and linearity conditions.,"H. Busemann1,2 & B. B.

Part I, comprising chapters 1–4, concerns problems and ideas about dimension from ancient times to about 1900. Chapter 1 deals with ancient Greek ideas about dimension and the origins of theories of hyperspaces and higher-dimensional geometries relating to the subsequent development of dimension theory. Chapter 2 treatsCantor's surprising discovery that continua of different dimension numbers can be put into one-one correspondence and his discussion withDedekind concerning the discovery. The problem of the invariance of dimension originates with this discovery. Chapter 3 deals with the early efforts of 1878–1879 to prove the invariance of dimension. Chapter 4 sketches the rise of point set topology with reference to the problem of proving dimensional invariance and the development of dimension theory. Part II, comprising chapters 5–8, concerns the development of dimension theory during the early part of the twentieth century. Chapter 5 deals with new approaches to the concept of dimension and the problem of dimensional invariance. Chapter 6 analyses the origins ofBrouwer's interest in topology and his breakthrough to the first general proof of the invariance of dimension. Chapter 7 treatsLebesgue's ideas about dimension and the invariance problem and the dispute that arose betweenBrouwer andLebesgue which led toBrouwer's further work on topology and dimension. Chapter 8 offers glimpses of the development of dimension theory afterBrouwer, especially the development of the dimension theory ofUrysohn andMenger during the twenties.

Kerckhoff, F. Gardiner and H. Masur. There is a natural compactification using extremal length geometry introduced by Gardiner and Masur. The compactification is realized in a certain projective space. We develop the extremal length geometry in the cone which is defined as the inverse image of the compactification via the quotient mapping. The compactification is identified with a subset of the cone by taking an appropriate lift. The cone contains canonically the space of measured foliations in the boundary. We first extend the geometric intersection number on the space of measured foliations to the cone, and observe that the restriction of the intersection number to Teichmüller space is represented by an explicit formula in terms of the Gromov product with respect to the Teichmüller distance. From this observation, we deduce that the Gromov product extends continuously to the compactification. As an application, we obtain an alternative approach to a characterization of the isometry group of Teichmüller space. We also obtain a new realization of Teichmüller space, a hyperboloid model of Teichmüller space with respect to the Teichmüller distance.",Hideki Miyachi,Mathematische Zeitschrift,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00209-014-1346-y,"Teichmüller space,Teichmüller distance,Extremal length, Intersection number,Gromov product,Mapping class group"

502,Sturm theory with applications in geometry and classical mechanics,"Classical Sturm non-oscillation and comparison theorems as well as the Sturm theorem on zeros for solutions of second order differential equations have a natural symplectic version, since they describe the rotation of a line in the phase plane of the equation. In the higher dimensional symplectic version of these theorems, lines are replaced by Lagrangian subspaces and intersections with a given line are replaced by non-transversality instants with a distinguished Lagrangian subspace. Thus the symplectic Sturm theorems describe some properties of the Maslov index. Starting from the celebrated paper of Arnol’d on symplectic Sturm theory for optical Hamiltonians, we provide a generalization of his results to general Hamiltonians. We finally apply these results for detecting some geometrical information about the distribution of conjugate and focal points on semi-Riemannian manifolds and for studying the geometrical properties of the solutions space of singular Lagrangian systems arising in Celestial Mechanics.","Vivina L.

503,The geometry of recombination,"With the tools of information geometry, we can express relations between marginals of a joint distribution in geometric terms. We develop this framework in the context of population genetics and use this to interpret the famous Ohta–Kimura formula (cf. Ohta and Kimura in Genet Res 13(01):47–55, 1969) and discuss its generalizations for linkage equilibria in Wright–Fisher models with recombination with several loci. The state space associated with the Ohta–Kimura model is simply a Riemannian manifold of constant positive curvature. Furthermore, the equilibria states for recombination can be interpreted geometrically as a product of spheres. In the case of only 2 loci, we also derive the behavior of the mutual information between these two loci.","Julian Hofrichter1, Jürgen Jost

505,Differential Algebras with Banach-Algebra Coefficients II: The Operator Cross-Ratio Tau-Function and the Schwarzian Derivative,"Several features of an analytic (infinite-dimensional) Grassmannian of (commensurable) subspaces of a Hilbert space were developed in the context of integrable PDEs (KP hierarchy). We extended some of those features when polarized separable Hilbert spaces are generalized to a class of polarized Hilbert modules and then consider the classical Baker and τ-functions as operator-valued. Following from Part I we produce a pre-determinant structure for a class of τ-functions defined in the setting of the similarity class of projections of a certain Banach *-algebra. This structure is explicitly derived from the transition map of a corresponding principal bundle. The determinant of this map leads to an operator τ-function. We extend to this setting the operator cross-ratio which had previously been used to produce the scalar-valued τ-function, as well as the associated notion of a Schwarzian derivative along curves inside the space of similarity classes of a given projection. We link directly this cross-ratio with Fay’s trisecant identity for the τ-function. By restriction to the image of the Krichever map, we use the Schwarzian to introduce the notion of an operator-valued projective structure on a compact Riemann surface: this allows a deformation inside the Grassmannian (as it varies its complex structure). Lastly, we use our identification of the Jacobian of the Riemann surface in terms of extensions of the Burchnall–Chaundy C*-algebra (Part I) provides a link to the study of the KP hierarchy.","Maurice J.

2 is the Hodge–Laplacian, then the local geometric Riesz transform D(Δ+aI)−1/2 has a bounded extension to \(h^{p}_{D}\) for all p∈[1,∞], provided that a>0 is large enough compared to the exponential growth of M. A characterization of \(h^{1}_{\mathcal{D}}\) in terms of local molecules is also obtained.

For this C*-algebra topological invariants of the spectral ring become readily available, and further, the Brown–Douglas–Fillmore theory of extensions can be applied. We construct KK classes of the spectral curve of the ring and, motivated by the fact that all isospectral Burchnall–Chaundy rings make up the Jacobian of the curve, we compare the (degree-1) K-homology of the curve with that of its Jacobian.

The results deal with smooth surfaces, as well as with singular Alexandrov surfaces (also called surfaces with bounded integral curvature), a class which includes for instance surfaces with conical singularities and surfaces of CAT(0) type. Moreover, we study the geodesic curvature of the level curves and of the steepest descent for harmonic functions on surfaces with non-necessarily constant Gaussian curvature K. Such geodesic curvature functions turn out to satisfy certain Laplace-type equations and inequalities, from which we infer various maximum and minimum principles. The results are complemented by a number of growth estimates for the derivatives \(L'\) and \(L''\) of the length of the level curve function L, as well as by examples illustrating the presentation. Our work generalizes some results due to Alessandrini, Longinetti, Talenti, Ma–Zhang and Wang–Wang.

We analyse the order of such methods, and somewhat surprisingly there does not appear any new order conditions for the Runge—Kutta methods in our context, at least up to order 4. The analysis shows that some terms appearing in the error expansions can be quite naturally expressed in terms of standard notions of Riemannian geometry.

On any given d-dimensional manifold, we then consider differential operators tangent to the manifold as well as discrete differential operators (jumps) normal to the manifold. The combined action of these operators leads to the notion of a semi-discrete differential operator coupling manifolds of different dimensions. We refer to the resulting systems of equations as mixed-dimensional, which have become a popular modeling technique for physical applications including fractured and composite materials. We establish analytical tools in the mixed-dimensional setting, including suitable inner products, differential and codifferential operators, Poincaré lemma, and Poincaré–Friedrichs inequality. The manuscript is concluded by defining the mixed-dimensional minimization problem corresponding to the Hodge Laplacian, and we show that this minimization problem is well-posed.

519,A Symbolic Dynamic Geometry System Using the Analytical Geometry Method,"A symbolic geometry system such as Geometry Expressions can generate symbolic measurements in terms of indeterminate inputs from a geometric figure. It has elements of dynamic geometry system and elements of automated theorem prover. Geometry Expressions is based on the analytical geometry method. We describe the method in the style used by expositions of semi-synthetic theorem provers such as the area method. The analytical geometry method differs in that it considers geometry from a traditional Euclidean/Cartesian perspective. To the extent that theorems are proved, they are only proved for figures sufficiently close to the given figure. This clearly has theoretical disadvantages, however they are balanced by the practical advantage that the geometrical model used is familiar to students and engineers. The method decouples constructions from geometrical measurements, and thus admits a broad variety of measurement types and construction types. An algorithm is presented for automatically deriving simple forms for angle expressions and is shown to be equivalent to a class of traditional proofs. A semi-automated proof system comprises the symbolic geometry system, a CAS and the user. The user’s inclusion in the hybrid system is a key pedagogic advantage.

These dualities generate comparison theorems on differential equations of mixed types I and II (see Theorems 2.3 and 2.4) and lead to comparison theorems in Riemannian geometry (see Theorems 2.5 and 2.8) with analytic, geometric, PDE’s and physical applications. In particular, we prove Hessian comparison theorems (see Theorems 3.1–3.5) and Laplacian comparison theorems (see Theorems 2.6, 2.7 and 3.1–3.5) under varied radial Ricci curvature, radial curvature, Ricci curvature and sectional curvature assumptions, generalizing and extending the work of Han-Li-Ren-Wei (2014) and Wei (2016). We also extend the notion of function or differential form growth to bundle-valued differential form growth of various types and discuss their interrelationship (see Theorem 5.4). These provide tools in extending the notion, integrability and decomposition of generalized harmonic forms to those of bundle-valued generalized harmonic forms, introducing Condition W for bundle-valued differential forms, and proving the duality theorem and the unity theorem, generalizing the work of Andreotti and Vesentini (1965) and Wei (2020). We then apply Hessian and Laplacian comparison theorems to obtain comparison theorems in mean curvature, generalized sharp Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities on Riemannian manifolds, the embedding theorem for weighted Sobolev spaces of functions on manifolds, geometric differential-integral inequalities, generalized sharp Hardy type inequalities on Riemannian manifolds, monotonicity formulas and vanishing theorems for differential forms of degree k with values in vector bundles, such as F-Yang-Mills fields (when F is the identity map, they are Yang-Mills fields), generalized Yang-Mills-Born-Infeld fields on manifolds, Liouville type theorems for F - harmonic maps (when \(F\left(t \right) = {1 \over p}{\left({2t} \right)^{{p \over 2}}},p > 1\), they become p-harmonic maps or harmonic maps if p = 2), and Dirichlet problems on starlike domains for vector bundle valued differential 1-forms and {tF}-harmonic maps (see Theorems 4.1, 7.3–7.7, 8.1, 9.1–9.3, 10.1, 11.2, 12.1 and 12.2), generalizing the work of Caffarelli et al.

"," We prove the simultaneous (k, n — k)-systolic freedom, for a pair of adjacent integers k < n/2, of a simply connected n-manifold X. Our construction, related to recent results of I. Babenko, is concentrated in a neighborhood of suitable k-dimensional submanifolds of X. We employ calibration by differential forms supported in such neighborhoods, to provide lower bounds for the (n — k)-systoles. Meanwhile, the k-systoles are controlled from below by the monotonicity formula combined with the bounded geometry of the construction in a neighborhood of suitable (n — k + 1)-dimensional submanifolds, in spite of the vanishing of the global injectivity radius. The construction is geometric, with the algebraic topology ingredient reduced to Poincaré duality and Thom's theorem on representing multiples of homology classes by submanifolds. The present result is di.erent from the proof, in collaboration with A. Suciu, and relying on rational homotopy theory, of the k-systolic freedom of X. Our results concerning systolic freedom contrast with the existence of stable systolic inequalities, studied in joint work with V. Bangert.

534,Integral geometry of complex space forms,"We show how Alesker’s theory of valuations on manifolds gives rise to an algebraic picture of the integral geometry of any Riemannian isotropic space. We then apply this method to give a thorough account of the integral geometry of the complex space forms, i.e. complex projective space, complex hyperbolic space and complex Euclidean space. In particular, we compute the family of kinematic formulas for invariant valuations and invariant curvature measures in these spaces. In addition to new and more efficient framings of the tube formulas of Gray and the kinematic formulas of Shifrin, this approach yields a new formula expressing the volumes of the tubes about a totally real submanifold in terms of its intrinsic Riemannian structure. We also show by direct calculation that the Lipschitz-Killing valuations stabilize the subspace of invariant angular curvature measures, suggesting the possibility that a similar phenomenon holds for all Riemannian manifolds. We conclude with a number of open questions and conjectures.","Andreas Bernig1, Joseph H. G.

Noncommutative (NC) foundations of these structures are introduced for associative Poisson algebras; noncommutative generalizations of such notions of the classical symplectic geometry as a degenerate Poisson structure, a Poisson submanifold, a symplectic foliation, and a symplectic leaf for associative Poisson algebras are also introduced. These structures are considered for the case of the endomorphism algebra of a vector bundle, and a full description of the family of Poisson structures for this algebra is given. An algebraic construction of the reduction procedure for degenerate noncommutative Poisson structures is developed. An NC generalization of the Bott connection on a foliated manifold is introduced by using the notions of NC submanifold and quotient manifold. This definition is applied to degenerate NC Poisson algebras, which allows one to consider the Bott connection not only for regular but also for singular Poisson structures.",Z.

The focus of this work is to show how to distribute the source terms in the recursive equation system in order to guarantee arithmetic stability and thus numerical convergence of the obtained solution, guided by a condition number criterion. Some examples are compared with results from literature and parameter combinations are analyzed, for which the condition number analysis indicates convergence of the solutions obtained by the recursive scheme.","Cibele A.

We show that the Lipschitz quasiminima, which satisfy an equipartition of energy condition, possess density estimates of Caffarelli–Cordoba-type, that is, roughly speaking, the complement of their interfaces occupies a positive density portion of balls of large radii. From this, it follows that the level sets of the rescaled quasiminima approach locally uniformly hypersurfaces of quasiminimal perimeter. If the quasiminimum is also a solution of the associated PDE, the limit hypersurface is shown to have zero mean curvature and a quantitative viscosity bound on the mean curvature of the level sets is given.

The problem is formulated in both the standard and mixed variational forms, and after establishing the existence and uniqueness of solutions to these equivalent problems, the corresponding discrete problems are studied. Finite element approximations of the mixed problem are shown to be stable and convergent. It is shown that the equivalence between the mixed problem and the standard problem with selective reduced integration holds only for the case of rods having constant curvature and torsion, though.

596,Iterative Approximation of Statistical Distributions and Relation to Information Geometry,"The optimal control of stochastic processes through sensor estimation of probability density functions is given a geometric setting via information theory and the information metric. Information theory identifies the exponential distribution as the maximum entropy distribution if only the mean is known and the Γ distribution if also the mean logarithm is known. The surface representing Γ models has a natural Riemannian information metric. The exponential distributions form a one-dimensional subspace of the two-dimensional space of all Γ distributions, so we have an isometric embedding of the random model as a subspace of the Γ models. This geometry provides an appropriate structure on which to represent the dynamics of a process and algorithms to control it. This short paper presents a comparative study on the parameter estimation performance between the geodesic equation and the B-spline function approximations when they are used to optimize the parameters of the Γ family distributions. In this case, the B-spline functions are first used to approximate the Γ probability density function on a fixed length interval; then the coefficients of the approximation are related, through mean and variance calculations, to the two parameters (i.e. μ and β) in Γ distributions. A gradient based parameter tuning method has been used to produce the trajectories for (μ, β) when B-spline functions are used, and desired results have been obtained which are comparable to the trajectories obtained from the geodesic equation.",C.

We define a 2-form \({\omega_{\mathcal{S}_{i}(\Sigma)}}\) on the space \({\mathcal{S}_{i}(\Sigma)}\) of immersed symplectic surfaces in M, and show that the form is closed and non-degenerate, up to reparametrizations. Then we give conditions on a compatible almost complex structure J on (M, ω) that ensure that the restriction of \({\omega_{\mathcal{S}_{i}(\Sigma)}}\) to the moduli space of simple immersed J-holomorphic Σ-curves in a homology class \({A \in {H}_2(M,\,\mathbb{Z})}\) is a symplectic form, and show applications and examples.

610,1-Conformal geometry of quasi statistical manifolds,"A quasi statistical manifold is a generalization of a statistical manifold. The notion of quasi statistical manifolds was introduced to formulate the geometry of non-conservative estimating functions in statistics. Later, it was showed that quasi statistical manifolds are induced from affine distributions in the same way as statistical manifolds are induced from affine immersions. Here, an affine distribution is a non-integrable version of an affine immersion, and it is useful in quantum information geometry. On the other hand, it is known that generalized conformal geometry is useful for the study of statistical manifolds from the viewpoint of affine differential geometry. In particular, 1-conformal geometry of statistical manifolds gives a relation with the notion of affine immersions. Although generalized conformal geometry of quasi statistical manifolds is also expected to be useful, the geometry has not been cleared yet. The aim of this paper is to formulate 1-conformal geometry of quasi statistical manifolds. We research a relation between 1-conformal geometry of quasi statistical manifolds and the notion of affine distributions. As the main result, we show the fundamental theorems for affine distributions. We also formulate a hypersurface theory of quasi statistical manifolds.","Keisuke Haba

2 + 2b(q)dxdy + c(q)dy
2, whereq = (x,y,z). In a previous article [1] we proved that g can be written in a normal form where b Ξ 0, a = 1 + yF(q ), c = 1 + G(q ), where \(G|_{x = y = 0} = 0\). Moreover we analyzed the flat case a = c = 1. In this article we study the following one-parameter deformation of the flat case: a = l, c = (1 + ∈y)2 where µ ∈ ∝. We parametrize the set of geodesics using elliptic functions. This allows us to compute the trace of the sphere and the wave front of small radius on the plane y = 0. We show that the sphere of small radius is not sub-analytic. This analysis clarifies the role of one of the functional invariants in the normal form.","B. Bonnard1, M. Chyba2 & E.

Thus, the object geometry is described via parametrized geometric details placed on a regular lattice. Here, in a two dimensional set up we focus on ellipsoidal holes as the fine scale geometric details described by the semiaxes and their orientation. Optimization of a deterministic cost functional as well as stochastic loading with risk neutral and risk averse stochastic cost functionals are discussed. Under the assumption of linear elasticity and quadratic objective functions the computational cost scales linearly in the number of basis loads spanning the possibly large set of all realizations of the stochastic loading. The resulting shape optimization algorithm consists of a finite dimensional, constraint optimization scheme where the cost functional and its gradient are evaluated applying a boundary element method on the fine scale geometry. Various numerical results show the spatial variation of the geometric domain structures and the appearance of strongly anisotropic patterns.","Benedict Geihe1, Martin Lenz1, Martin Rumpf1 & …Rüdiger Schultz",Mathematical Programming,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-012-0531-1,"90C15 Stochastic Programming,65N38 Boundary element methods,65K10 Optimization and variational techniques"

Line source in cylindrical geometry,"A two-dimensional line source outflow is considered, in which the evolution of a sharp interface separating an incompressible fluid from a bounding weakly compressible gas is analysed. Linear theory is applied, assuming that anisotropies in the source outflow are small, to develop an approximate solution for the interfacial evolution. The simplest solutions to the governing linearised equations require the presence of a high-order velocity singularity at the location of the line source. A spectral method is also developed to capture the nonlinear behaviour of the flow; after some finite time, curvature singularities are found to develop on the interface. Comparisons are made between the stability of the interface and its analogue which separates two incompressible fluids. It is found that when the bounding fluid is weakly compressible rather than incompressible, the stability of the interface is significantly increased.",Oliver A. Krzysik1 nAff2 & Lawrence K.

619,Complex geometry of moment-angle manifolds,"Moment-angle manifolds provide a wide class of examples of non-Kähler compact complex manifolds. A complex moment-angle manifold \(\mathcal {Z}\) is constructed via certain combinatorial data, called a complete simplicial fan. In the case of rational fans, the manifold \(\mathcal {Z}\) is the total space of a holomorphic bundle over a toric variety with fibres compact complex tori. In general, a complex moment-angle manifold \(\mathcal {Z}\) is equipped with a canonical holomorphic foliation \({\mathcal {F}}\) which is equivariant with respect to the \(({\mathbb {C}}^\times )^m\)-action. Examples of moment-angle manifolds include Hopf manifolds of Vaisman type, Calabi–Eckmann manifolds, and their deformations. We construct transversely Kähler metrics on moment-angle manifolds, under some restriction on the combinatorial data. We prove that any Kähler submanifold (or, more generally, a Fujiki class \(\mathcal {C}\) subvariety) in such a moment-angle manifold is contained in a leaf of the foliation \({\mathcal {F}}\). For a generic moment-angle manifold \(\mathcal {Z}\) in its combinatorial class, we prove that all subvarieties are moment-angle manifolds of smaller dimension and there are only finitely many of them. This implies, in particular, that the algebraic dimension of \(\mathcal {Z}\) is zero.","Taras Panov1,2,3, Yury Ustinovskiy4,5 & Misha Verbitsky6,",Mathematische Zeitschrift,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00209-016-1658-1,"Moment-angle manifold,Simplicial fan,Non-Kähler complex structure,Holomorphic foliation,Transversely Kähler metric"
620,Information geometry and sufficient statistics,"Information geometry provides a geometric approach to families of statistical models. The key geometric structures are the Fisher quadratic form and the Amari–Chentsov tensor. In statistics, the notion of sufficient statistic expresses the criterion for passing from one model to another without loss of information. This leads to the question how the geometric structures behave under such sufficient statistics. While this is well studied in the finite sample size case, in the infinite case, we encounter technical problems concerning the appropriate topologies. Here, we introduce notions of parametrized measure models and tensor fields on them that exhibit the right behavior under statistical transformations. Within this framework, we can then handle the topological issues and show that the Fisher metric and the Amari–Chentsov tensor on statistical models in the class of symmetric 2-tensor fields and 3-tensor fields can be uniquely (up to a constant) characterized by their invariance under sufficient statistics, thereby achieving a full generalization of the original result of Chentsov to infinite sample sizes. More generally, we decompose Markov morphisms between statistical models in terms of statistics. In particular, a monotonicity result for the Fisher information naturally follows.","Nihat Ay1,3, Jürgen Jost1,2,3, Hông Vân Lê4 & …Lorenz Schwachhöfer",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-014-0574-8,"Fisher quadratic form,Amari–Chentsov tensor,Sufficient statistic,Chentsov theorem"

Reconstruction is sometimes possible if the signature \((n_1,n_2)\) satisfies \(n_1\ge 1\) and \(n_2\ge 2\) or vice versa and always when \(n_1,n_2\ge 2\). The proofs are based on a Pestov identity adapted to null geodesics (product manifolds) and Fourier analysis (other geometries). The problem in a Minkowski space of any signature is a special case of recovering a function in a Euclidean space from its integrals over all lines with any given set of admissible directions, and we describe sets of lines for which this is possible.

628,An approach to stability analyses in general relativity via symplectic geometry,"We begin with a review of the statements of non-linear, linear and mode stability of autonomous dynamical systems in classical mechanics, using symplectic geometry. We then discuss what the Arnowitt–Deser–Misner (ADM) phase space and the ADM Hamiltonian of general relativity are, what constitutes a dynamical system, and subsequently present a nascent attempt to draw a formal analogy between the notions of stability in these two theories. We wish to note that we have not discussed here the construction of the reduced phase space by forming the quotient space of the constrained phase space with the gauge orbits. Our approach here is pedagogical and geometric, and the motivation is to unify and simplify a formal understanding of the statements regarding the stability of stationary solutions of general relativity. That is, typically the governing equations of motion of a Hamiltonian dynamical system are simply the flow equations of the associated symplectic Hamiltonian vector field, defined on phase space, and the non-linear stability analysis of its critical points have simply to do with the divergence of its flow there. Further, the linear stability of a critical point is related to the properties of the tangent flow of the Hamiltonian vector field. In the second half of this work, we posit that a study of the genericity of a particular black hole or naked singularity spacetime forming as an endstate of gravitational collapse is equivalent to an inquiry of how sensitive the orbits of the symplectic Hamiltonian vector field of general relativity are to changes in initial data. We demonstrate this by conducting a restricted non-linear stability analysis of the formation of a Schwarzschild black hole, working in the usual initial value formulation of general relativity.","Prashant Kocherlakota

It is shown that parametrization of the interval—the basic aspect of geometry—is carried out non-relativistically. A relativistic way of parametrization is suggested, and the corresponding variant of the geometry is constructed. The equation for the geodesic of this variant of geometry, aside from the Riemannian, has a generalized Lorentz term, the connection contains an additional Lorentz tensorial summand, and the first schouten is different from zero. Some physical consequences of the new geometry are considered: the non-measurability of the generalized electromagnetic potential in the classical case and its measurability on quantum scales (the Aharonov-Bohm effect); it is shown that in the quantum limit the hypothesis of discreteness of space-time is plausible. The linear effect with respect to the field of the “redshift” is also considered and contemporary experimental possibilities of its registration are estimated; it is shown that the experimental results could uniquely determine the choice between the standard Riemannian and relativistic Finslerian models of space-time.",V.

641,Discretizing Laplace–Beltrami Operator from Differential Quantities,"The Laplace–Beltrami operator (LBO) is the fundamental geometric object associated with manifold surfaces and has been widely used in various tasks in geometric processing.By understanding that the LBO can be computed by differential quantities, we propose an approach for discretizing the LBO on manifolds by estimating differential quantities. For a point on the manifold, we first fit a quadratic surface to this point and its neighborhood by minimizing the least-square energy function. Then we compute the first- and second-order differential quantities by the approximated quadratic surface. Finally the discrete LBO at this point is computed from the estimated differential quantities and thus the Laplacian matrix over the discrete manifold is constructed.Our approach has several advantages: it is simple and efficient and insensitive to noise and boundaries. Experimental results have shown that our approach performs better than most of the current approaches.We also propose a feature-aware scheme for modifying the Laplacian matrix. The modified Laplacian matrix can be used in other feature preserving geometric processing applications.","Ruimin Wang1, Zhouwang Yang1, Ligang Liu1 & …Qing Chen",Communications in Mathematics and Statistics,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40304-013-0018-2,"Laplace–Beltrami operator,Discretization,Differential quantities"

Given a connected semisimple complex Lie-groupG with Lie-algebrag, we study the representation\(\psi _X :U(\mathfrak{g}) \to D(X)\) of the enveloping algebra of\(\mathfrak{g}\) by global differential operators on a complete homogeneous spaceX=G/P. It turns out that the kernelI

x

X
 is the annihilator of a generalizedVerma-module. On the other hand, we study the associated graded ideal grI

x
, and relate it to the geometry of a generalizedSpringer-resolution, that is a map\(\pi _X :T^* (X) \to \mathfrak{g}\) of the cotangent-bundle ofX onto a nilpotent variety in\(\mathfrak{g}\), as studied e.g. in [BM1]. We prove, for instance, that grI

x
 is prime if and only if π
X
 is birational with normal image. In general, we show that\(\sqrt {grI_X }\) is prime. Equivalently, the associated variety ofI

x
 in\(\mathfrak{g}\) is irreducible: In fact, it is the closure of theRichardson-orbit determined byP. For the homogeneous spaceY=G/(P, P), we prove that the analogous idealI

y
 has for associated variety the closure of theDixmier-sheet determined byP. From this main result, we derive as a corollary, that for any module induced from a finitedimensional LieP-module the associated variety of the annihilator is irreducible, proving an old conjecture [B2], 2.5.

Symmetries (generalized/nonlocal) for these equations are also studied, by considering infinitesimal deformations of the associated pseudo-spherical surfaces.Finally, conservation laws for equations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces immersed in a flat three-space are found, and the class of ‘equations describing Calapso–Guichard surfaces’ is introduced.",Enrique G.

669,Cone structures and parabolic geometries,"A cone structure on a complex manifold M is a closed submanifold \(\mathcal {C}\subset \mathbb {P}TM\) of the projectivized tangent bundle which is submersive over M. A conic connection on \(\mathcal {C}\) specifies a distinguished family of curves on M in the directions specified by \(\mathcal {C}\). There are two common sources of cone structures and conic connections, one in differential geometry and another in algebraic geometry. In differential geometry, we have cone structures induced by the geometric structures underlying holomorphic parabolic geometries, a classical example of which is the null cone bundle of a holomorphic conformal structure. In algebraic geometry, we have the cone structures consisting of varieties of minimal rational tangents (VMRT) given by minimal rational curves on uniruled projective manifolds. The local invariants of the cone structures in parabolic geometries are given by the curvature of the parabolic geometries, the nature of which depend on the type of the parabolic geometry, i.e., the type of the fibers of \(\mathcal {C}\rightarrow M\). For the VMRT-structures, more intrinsic invariants of the conic connections which do not depend on the type of the fiber play important roles. We study the relation between these two different aspects for the cone structures induced by parabolic geometries associated with a long simple root of a complex simple Lie algebra. As an application, we obtain a local differential-geometric version of the global algebraic-geometric recognition theorem due to Mok and Hong–Hwang. In our local version, the role of rational curves is completely replaced by appropriate torsion conditions on the conic connection.","Jun-Muk Hwang1 & Katharina Neusser

670,A Posteriori Error Estimates of Spectral Approximations for Second Order Partial Differential Equations in Spherical Geometries,"In this paper, we investigate a posteriori error estimates of the Galerkin spectral methods for second-order equations, and propose a simple type of error estimator comprising expansion coefficients of known quantities such as the right-hand term. We first show that the errors of the numerical solution of the Poisson equation on the unit ball in arbitrary dimensions can be identified by the approximation errors of the (weighted) \(L^2\)-projection of the right-hand function together with the non-homogeneous boundary function. This result indicates that the decay rate of the high frequency coefficients of the right-hand term in weighted orthogonal ball polynomials and of the boundary term in spherical harmonics serves as an ideal a posteriori error estimator. In the sequel, we establish a posteriori error estimates on the Galerkin spectral method applied to the singular perturbation problem of a reaction–diffusion equation on the unit ball. Again, the efficiency is given by the approximation errors of the weighted \(L^2\)-projection of the right-hand function; while the reliability is determined by the truncation errors of the right-hand function together with exponentially decaying multiples of the low frequency coefficients, which also reveals that the a posterior error estimator is dominated by the decay rate of the high frequency coefficients of the right-hand term. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.","Jianwei Zhou1,2, Huiyuan Li

677,The last formula of Jean-Louis Koszul,"Since the first international conference in France on the Information Geometry, GSI2013, Jean-Louis Koszul’s interest in Information Geometry went increasing. Motivated by the impact of the cohomology of Koszul-Vinberg algebras on the Information Geometry and moved by some issues raised by Albert Nijenhuis, Jean-Louis Koszul undertook another rewriting of the Brut formula of the coboundary operator of the KV complex. The source of other motivations of Jean-Louis Koszul was the relationships between the theory of KV cohomology and the theory of deformation of locally flat manifolds.In 2015 Jean-Louis Koszul sent me his Last formula of the KV boundary operator. In that Last formula Jean-Louis Koszul dealt with the case where spaces of coefficients are trivial modules of KV algebras. A part of the present work is devoted to extending the Last formula of Jean-Louis Koszul to KV cochain complexes whose spaces of coefficients are non-trivial two-sided modules of KV algebras. At another side, I also aim to highlight other significant impacts of the theory of KV cohomology of Koszul-Vinberg algebras. In particular I will use the KV cohomology to widely revisit the theory of statistical models of measurable sets. The reader will see why the source of the theory of statistical models is of homological nature.I also intend to highlight several impacts of the KV cohomology on the quantitative differential topology. I am particularly concerned with problems regarding the existence of Riemannian foliations, the existence of symplectic foliations as well as the existence of multi-dimensional webs. The homological theory of statistical models is presented as branches of rooted trees whose roots are weakly Jensen random cohomology classes.","Michel Nguiffo Boyom

One of the first issues one meets in the functor of points approach to homotopical \({{{\mathcal {D}}}}\)-geometry, is the question of a model structure on the category \({\mathtt{DGAlg({{{\mathcal {D}}}})}}\) of differential non-negatively graded \({{{\mathcal {O}}}}\)-quasi-coherent sheaves of commutative algebras over the sheaf \({{{\mathcal {D}}}}\) of differential operators of an appropriate underlying variety \((X,{{{\mathcal {O}}}})\). We define a cofibrantly generated model structure on \({\mathtt{DGAlg({{{\mathcal {D}}}})}}\) via the definition of its weak equivalences and its fibrations, characterize the class of cofibrations, and build an explicit functorial ‘cofibration–trivial fibration’ factorization. We then use the latter to get a functorial model categorical Koszul–Tate resolution for \({{{\mathcal {D}}}}\)-algebraic ‘on-shell function’ algebras (which contains the classical Koszul–Tate resolution).

This theory gives a unified frame for some results on polynomial maps that were not related before.A well known theorem of J.

n to be a global diffeomorphism. In order to show thatf is a global diffeomorphism it suffices to exclude the existence of asymptotic values forf.The real Jacobian conjecture was shown to be false by S. Pinchuk. Our first application is to understand his construction within the general theory of asymptotic values of polynomial maps and prove that there is no such counterexample for the Jacobian conjecture overC. In a second application we reprove a theorem of Jeffrey Lang which gives an equivalent formulation of the Jacobian conjecture in terms of Newton polygons. This generalizes a result of Abhyankar. A third application is another equivalent formulation of the Jacobian conjecture in terms of finiteness of certain polynomial rings withinC[U, V].The theory has a geometrical aspect: we define and develop the theory of etale exotic surfaces. The simplest such surface corresponds to Pinchuk's construction in the real case. In fact, we prove one more equivalent formulation of the Jacobian conjecture using etale exotic surfaces. We consider polynomial vector fields on etale exotic surfaces and explore their properties in relation to the Jacobian conjecture.In another application we give the structure of the real variety of the asymptotic values of a polynomial mapf: R

709,On Computer-Aided Solving Differential Equations and Studying Stability of Markets,"For any nonholonomic manifold, i.e., a manifold with nonintegrable distribution, we define an analog of the Riemann curvature tensor and refer to Grozman's package SuperLie with the help of which the tensor had been computed in several cases. Being an analog of the usual curvature tensor, this invariant characterizes (in)stability of any nonholonomic dynamical system, in particular, of markets. Similar invariants give criteria for formal integrability of differential equations whose symmetries are induced by contact transformations similar to Goldshmidt's criteria for formal integrability of differential equations whose symmetries are induced by point transformations. As a byproduct, we obtain an approximate solution of the equation whose integrability is under study. Bibliography: 47 titles.","D.

As a consequence, we obtain the hc-differentiability almost everywhere of the quasiconformal mappings of Carnot-Carathéodory spaces.

714,The hydromechanics of hydrocephalus: Steady-state solutions for cylindrical geometry,"Hydrocephalus is a state in which the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid is disturbed. This fluid, produced within the brain at a constant rate, moves through internal cavities in it (ventricles), then exits through passages so that it may be absorbed by the surrounding membranes (meninges). Failure of fluid to move properly through these passages results in the distention of the passages and the ventricles. Ultimately, this distention causes large displacements and distortion of brain tissue as well as an increase of fluid in the extracellular space of the brain (edema). We use a two-phase model of fluid-saturated material to simulate the steady state of the hydrocephalic brain. Analytic solutions for the displacement of brain tissue and the distribution of edema for the annular regions of an idealized cylindrical geometry and small-strain theory are found. The solutions are used for a large-deformation analysis by superposition of the responses obtained for incrementally increasing loading. The effects of structural and hydraulic differences of white and gray brain matter, and the ependymal lining surrounding the venticles, are examined. The results reproduce the characteristic steady-state distribution of edema seen in hydrocephalus, and are compared with experiment.","Mariusz Kaczmarek1 nAff2, Ravi P. Subramaniam2 nAff4 & Samuel R.

729,Sub-Riemannian Geometry on Infinite-Dimensional Manifolds,"We generalize the concept of sub-Riemannian geometry to infinite-dimensional manifolds modeled on convenient vector spaces. On a sub-Riemannian manifold \(M\), the metric is defined only on a sub-bundle \({{\mathrm{\mathcal {H}}}}\) of the tangent bundle \(TM\), called the horizontal distribution. Similarly to the finite-dimensional case, we are able to split possible candidates for minimizing curves into two categories: semi-rigid curves that depend only on \({{\mathrm{\mathcal {H}}}}\), and normal geodesics that depend both on \({{\mathrm{\mathcal {H}}}}\) itself and on the metric on \({{\mathrm{\mathcal {H}}}}\). In this sense, semi-rigid curves in the infinite-dimensional case generalize the notion of singular curves for finite dimensions. In particular, we study the case of regular Lie groups with invariant sub-Riemannian structure. As examples, we consider the group of sense-preserving diffeomorphisms \({{\mathrm{Diff}}}\, S^1\) of the unit circle and the Virasoro–Bott group with their respective horizontal distributions chosen to be the Ehresmann connections with respect to a projection to the space of normalized univalent functions. In these cases we prove controllability and find formulas for the normal geodesics with respect to the pullback of the invariant Kählerian metric on the class of normalized univalent functions. The geodesic equations are analogues to the Camassa–Holm, Hunter–Saxton, KdV, and other known non-linear PDE.","Erlend Grong1, Irina Markina2 & Alexander Vasil’ev",The Journal of Geometric Analysis,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12220-014-9523-0,"Sub-Riemannian geometry,Infinite-dimensional manifold,Semi-rigid curves,Group of diffeomorphisms of the circle"

The symplectic geometry method is used to separate the whole variables and eigenvalues are obtained simultaneously. Finally, according to the method of eigen function expansion, the explicit solution for rectangular thin plate on foundation with the boundary conditions of four edges frees are developed. Since the basic elasticity equations of thin plate are only used and it is not need to select the deformation function arbitrarily. Therefore, the solution is theoretical and reasonable.

Consider a function that assigns a portfolio vector to each possible value of the market weight, and we perform self-financing trading using this portfolio function. We study the problem of characterizing functions such that the resulting portfolio will outperform the market portfolio in the long run under the conditions of diversity and sufficient volatility. No other assumption on the future behavior of stock prices is made. We prove that the only solutions are functionally generated portfolios in the sense of Fernholz.

He obtains the Hellinger distance on the full space of measures and the Fisher distance on the subset of probability measures. In order to highlight the interplay between Fisher theory and quantum information theory, we extend this construction to the space of positive-definite Hermitian matrices using Riemannian submersions and quotient manifolds. The analog of the Hellinger distance turns out to be the Bures–Wasserstein (BW) distance, a distance measure appearing in optimal transport, quantum information, and optimisation theory. First we present an existing derivation of the Riemannian metric and geodesics associated with this distance. Subsequently, we present a novel derivation of the Riemannian distance and geodesics for this metric on the subset of trace-one matrices, analogous to the Fisher distance for probability measures.","Jesse van Oostrum

743,Geometry of Nonadiabatic Quantum Hydrodynamics,"The Hamiltonian action of a Lie group on a symplectic manifold induces a momentum map generalizing Noether’s conserved quantity occurring in the case of a symmetry group. Then, when a Hamiltonian function can be written in terms of this momentum map, the Hamiltonian is called ‘collective’. Here, we derive collective Hamiltonians for a series of models in quantum molecular dynamics for which the Lie group is the composition of smooth invertible maps and unitary transformations. In this process, different fluid descriptions emerge from different factorization schemes for either the wavefunction or the density operator. After deriving this series of quantum fluid models, we regularize their Hamiltonians for finite \(\hbar \) by introducing local spatial smoothing. In the case of standard quantum hydrodynamics, the \(\hbar \ne 0\) dynamics of the Lagrangian path can be derived as a finite-dimensional canonical Hamiltonian system for the evolution of singular solutions called ‘Bohmions’, which follow Bohmian trajectories in configuration space. For molecular dynamics models, application of the smoothing process to a new factorization of the density operator leads to a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system for the interaction of multiple (nuclear) Bohmions and a sequence of electronic quantum states.","Michael S.

744,Crooked surfaces and anti-de Sitter geometry,Crooked planes were defined by Drumm to bound fundamental polyhedra in Minkowski space for Margulis spacetimes. They were extended by Frances to closed polyhedral surfaces in the conformal compactification of Minkowski space (Einstein space) which we call crooked surfaces. The conformal model of anti-de Sitter space is the interior of the quotient of Einstein space by an involution fixing an Einstein plane. The purpose of this note is to show that the crooked planes defined in anti-de Sitter space recently by Danciger-Guéritaud-Kassel lift to restrictions of crooked surfaces in Einstein space which are adapted under the involution of Einstein space defining anti-de Sitter space.,William M.

The decision-maker has a running cost of searching for information, and has to decide when to stop searching for information and choose one alternative. The expected payoff of each alternative evolves as a diffusion process when information is being learned. After establishing the well-posedness of the equation, we show that the optimal boundary where search is stopped (free boundary) is star-shaped, and present an asymptotic characterization of the value function and the free boundary.

754,Global geometry of 3-body motions with vanishing angular momentum I,"Following Jacobi’s geometrization of Lagrange’s least action principle, trajectories of classical mechanics can be characterized as geodesics on the configuration space M with respect to a suitable metric which is the conformal modification of the kinematic metric by the factor (U + h), where U and h are the potential function and the total energy, respectively. In the special case of 3-body motions with zero angular momentum, the global geometry of such trajectories can be reduced to that of their moduli curves, which record the change of size and shape, in the moduli space of oriented m-triangles, whose kinematic metric is, in fact, a Riemannian cone over the shape space M
* ≃ S
2(1/2).In this paper, it is shown that the moduli curve of such a motion is uniquely determined by its shape curve (which only records the change of shape) in the case of h h ≠ 0, while in the special case of h = 0 it is uniquely determined up to scaling. Thus, the study of the global geometry of such motions can be further reduced to that of the shape curves, which are time-parametrized curves on the 2-sphere characterized by a third order ODE. Moreover, these curves have two remarkable properties, namely the uniqueness of parametrization and the monotonicity, that constitute a solid foundation for a systematic study of their global geometry and naturally lead to the formulation of some pertinent problems.",Wu-Yi Hsiang1 & Eldar Straume,"Chinese Annals of Mathematics, Series B",2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11401-007-0153-8,"3-Body problem,Kinematic geometry,Reduction,Shape curves"

In this paper we review the reduced basis methods (built upon a high-fidelity ‘truth’ finite element approximation) for a rapid and reliable approximation of parametrized partial differential equations, and comment on their potential impact on applications of industrial interest. The essential ingredients of RB methodology are: a Galerkin projection onto a low-dimensional space of basis functions properly selected, an affine parametric dependence enabling to perform a competitive Offline-Online splitting in the computational procedure, and a rigorous a posteriori error estimation used for both the basis selection and the certification of the solution. The combination of these three factors yields substantial computational savings which are at the basis of an efficient model order reduction, ideally suited for real-time simulation and many-query contexts (for example, optimization, control or parameter identification). After a brief excursus on the methodology, we focus on linear elliptic and parabolic problems, discussing some extensions to more general classes of problems and several perspectives of the ongoing research.

To that end we use the method of Picard-Lindelöf approximation to prove the strong differentiability of the exponential map at the origin and hence a version of Gauss’ Lemma which does not require the differentiability of the exponential map. Contrary to naive differential degree counting, the distance functions are shown to gain one degree and hence to be \(C^{1,1}\). As an application to mathematical relativity, it is argued that the mentioned differentiability conditions can be considered the optimal ones to preserve most results of causality theory. This theory is also shown to be generalizable to the Finsler spacetime case. In particular, we prove that the local Lorentzian(-Finsler) length maximization property of causal geodesics in the class of absolutely continuous causal curves holds already for \(C^{1,1}\) spacetime metrics. Finally, we study the local existence of convex functions and show that arbitrarily small globally hyperbolic convex normal neighborhoods do exist.",E.

Here, we set up a new manifold (S), meanwhile the B-spline manifold (B) and the system output manifold (M) can be referred to as its submanifolds. We give an information geometrical algorithm which can be called as geodesic-projection algorithm using the properties of manifold. In the geodesic step, we can obtain the geodesic equation from the initial point V

779,Moving Frames and Differential Invariants on Fully Affine Planar Curves,"In this paper, by the affine analogue of the fundamental theorem for Euclidean planar curves, we classify the affine curves with constant affine curvatures. Note that we use the fully affine group and not the equi-affine subgroup consisting of area-preserving affine transformations. (Caution: much of the literature omits the “equi-” in their treatment.) According to the equivariant method of moving frames, explicit formulas for the generating affine differential invariants and invariant differential operators are constructed. At the same time, by using the fact that the affine transformation group GA\((2,\mathbb {R})\) can factor as a product of two subgroup \(B\cdot \mathrm{SE}(2,\mathbb {R})\) and the moving frame of the subgroup SE\((2,\mathbb {R})\), we build the moving frame of GA\((2,\mathbb {R})\) and obtain the relations among invariants of group GA\((2,\mathbb {R})\) and its subgroup SE\((2,\mathbb {R})\). Applying the affine curvature to recognize affine equivalent objects is considered in the last part of this paper.","Yun Yang1,2 & Yanhua Yu",Bulletin of the Malaysian Mathematical Sciences Society,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40840-019-00864-z,"Arc length parameter,Affine curvature,Maurer–Cartan invariant,Moving frame"
780,Primary Ideals and Their Differential Equations,"An ideal in a polynomial ring encodes a system of linear partial differential equations with constant coefficients. Primary decomposition organizes the solutions to the PDE. This paper develops a novel structure theory for primary ideals in a polynomial ring. We characterize primary ideals in terms of PDE, punctual Hilbert schemes, relative Weyl algebras, and the join construction. Solving the PDE described by a primary ideal amounts to computing Noetherian operators in the sense of Ehrenpreis and Palamodov. We develop new algorithms for this task, and we present efficient implementations.

Equipped with the Fisher information metric, \(\mathcal {N}\) becomes a Riemannian manifold. As such, it is diffeomorphic, but not isometric, to the Riemannian symmetric space \(\mathrm {Pos}_1(n+1,\mathbb {R})\) of unimodular positive definite symmetric \((n+1)\times (n+1)\)-matrices. As the computation of distances in the Fisher metric for \(n>1\) presents some difficulties, Lovrič et al. (J Multivar Anal 74:36–48, 2000) proposed to use the Killing metric on \(\mathrm {Pos}_1(n+1,\mathbb {R})\) as an alternative metric in which distances are easier to compute. In this work, we survey the geometric properties of the space \(\mathcal {N}\) and provide a quantitative analysis of the defect of certain geodesics for the Killing metric to be geodesics for the Fisher metric. We find that for these geodesics the use of the Killing metric as an approximation for the Fisher metric is indeed justified for long distances.","Wolfgang Globke1 & Raul Quiroga-Barranco

We want to clarify some results and methods such as the isocline method or the role of rotation parameters. To this end, we recall how to associate a pencil of isoclines to each quadratic differential equation. We discuss the parameterization of the space of regular pencils of isoclines by the space of its multiple base points and the equivariant action of the affine group on the fibration of the space of regular quadratic differential equations over the space of regular pencils of isoclines. This fibration is principal, with a projective group as structural group, and we prove that there exits an open cone in its Lie algebra whose elements generate rotation parameter families. Finally we use this geometric approach to construct specific families of quadratic differential equations depending in a nonlinear way of parameters which have a geometric meaning: they parameterize the set of singular points or are rotation parameters leaving fixed this set.",Robert Roussarie1 & Dana Schlomiuk,Qualitative Theory of Dynamical Systems,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02969335,"Quadratic systems,pencil of isoclines,rotation parameters"

A level set function is used to represent and capture the moving interface. A dual function orthogonal to the level set function defined in a neighborhood of the interface is used to represent some associated quantity on the interface and evolves according to a PDE on the moving interface. In particular we use a convection diffusion equation for surfactant concentration on an interface passively convected in an incompressible flow as a model problem.

A key step towards the realization of the aim is to develop ways of aligning three-dimensional structures of homologus proteins, thereby deriving the rules useful for protein modelling. We have developed a generalized differential-geometric representation of protein local conformation for use in a protein comparison program which aligns protein sequences on the basis of their sequence and conformational knowledge. Because the differetial-geometric distance measure between local conformations is independent of the coordinate frame and remains chirality information, the comparison program is easily implemented, relatively rational and reasonably fast. The utility of this program for aligning closely and distantly related homologous proteins is demonstrated by multiple alignment of globins, serine proteinases and aspartic proteinase domains. Particularly, the method has reached the rational alignment between the mammalian and microbial serine proteinases as compared with many published alignment programs.","Ding Da-Fu1, Qian Jiang1 & Feng Zu-Kang",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,1994,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02458274,"Aspartic Proteinase,Dissimilarity Matrix,Global Similarity,Simulated Annealing Procedure,Protein Structure Comparison"

Fundamental physical laws served as its basis. The Huygens–Roche figure (its total mass is concentrated in the center, while the rotating atmosphere takes the equilibrium form) plays an important role in the theory. Properties of the figure are carefully examined. In particular, it is known that each isobar (surface of equal pressure) itself is one of the three-parameter family of Huygens—Roche surfaces. However, as far as we know, convexity (or its absence) has not been discussed in the literature. Meanwhile, there are non-convex figures between equilibrium ones. In the present paper, we find the curvature of the meridional section of an arbitrary Huygens—Roche figure both in closed form and in the form of a series in powers of the Clairaut parameter, which is basic in the theory of equilibrium figures. We succeeded in proving that the curvature is positive and is bounded away from zero. Hence, every surface of the family of Huygens—Roche figures is convex and has no points of flattening. Moreover, none of the curves on its surface has points of straightening.","K. V.

The principal result states that the first Stiefel–Whitney class of such a moduli space is given by the ℤ2-spectral flow of the families of linearised operators. Under an additional compactness hypotheses, we develop elements of Morse–Bott theory and express the algebraic number of solutions of a non-homogeneous equation with a generic right-hand side in terms of the Euler characteristic of the space of solutions corresponding to the homogeneous equation.

816,"Spectral curves, opers and integrable systems","We establish a general link between integrable systems in algebraic geometry (expressed as Jacobian flows on spectral curves) and soliton equations (expressed as evolution equations on flat connections). Our main result is a natural isomorphism between a moduli space of spectral data and a moduli space of differential data, each equipped with an infinite collection of commuting flows. The spectral data are principal G-bundles on an algebraic curve, equipped with an abelian reduction near one point. The flows on the spectral side come from the action of a Heisenberg subgroup of the loop group. The differential data are flat connections known as opers. The flows on the differential side come from a generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchy. Our isomorphism between the two sides provides a geometric description of the entire phase space of the hierarchy. It extends the Krichever construction of special algebro-geometric solutions of the n-th KdV hierarchy, corresponding to G = SL

Reductive perturbation theory (RPT) has been applied for constructing a non-planar Schamel Burgers (NSB) equation using the basic field equation. The effects of the viscosity, collisions may cause the origination of anomalous dissipation, which usually creates shock-type wave solution. It has been found from the present investigation that the impacts of the viscosity, collisions may cause the origination of anomalous dissipation, which usually creates shock-type wave solution. Again, in the presence of weak dissipation balance between the nonlinearity and dispersion effect leads to form a solitary wave solution. To find the solitary solution, the weighted residual method (WRM) has been applied. An any kind of extended Burgers system, like KdV-Burgers, modified KdV-Burgers can be tracked from the standard evolution equation using WRM. Moreover, the nonplanar KdV type equation with Burgers term can also be solved easily by applying this technique. The shock solution can be generated from the system by applying the simplified Hirota bilinear method (SHBM), which is the most effective technique for finding a shock-type solution in a nonlinear system. The SBHM can be utilized simply for finding a solution to an evolution equation as the method does not claim the bilinear form of the equation. The effect of index \(\kappa \) (superthermality), and that of the parameter \(\beta \) (characteristic trapping) in propagation of IAW waves has been investigated in NSB medium.

This process is studied by using a two-dimensional model describing the slow motion of a thin viscous nonisothermal liquid film flowing over complex topography. The model is based on the Navier-Stokes equations in the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation. The density, surface tension, and viscosity of the liquid are linear functions of temperature. For a nonisothermal flow over a planar substrate with a local heater, the influence of the heater on the free surface is analyzed numerically depending on the buoyancy effect, Marangoni stresses, and variable viscosity. The analysis shows that the film can create its own ridges or valleys depending on the heater and the dominating liquid properties. It is shown that the capillary ridges generated by the substrate features can be optimally leveled by using various types of heaters consistent with the dominating liquid properties.

840,The design of linear algebra and geometry,"Conventional formulations of linear algebra do not do justice to the fundamental concepts of meet, join, and duality in projective geometry. This defect is corrected by introducing Clifford algebra into the foundations of linear algebra. There is a natural extension of linear transformations on a vector space to the associated Clifford algebra with a simple projective interpretation. This opens up new possibilities for coordinate-free computations in linear algebra. For example, the Jordan form for a linear transformation is shown to be equivalent to a canonical factorization of the unit pseudoscalar. This approach also reveals deep relations between the structure of the linear geometries, from projective to metrical, and the structure of Clifford algebras. This is apparent in a new relation between additive and multiplicative forms for intervals in the cross-ratio. Also, various factorizations of Clifford algebras into Clifford algebras of lower dimension are shown to have projective interpretations.As an important application with many uses in physics as well as in mathematics, the various representations of the conformal group in Clifford algebra are worked out in great detail.

The main purpose of this second part of this series is to classify CR-warped products in complex projective and complex hyperbolic spaces which satisfy the equality.,Bang-Yen Chen,Monatshefte für Mathematik,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s006050170002,"2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 53C40,53C42,53B25"

The problem of uniqueness of the canonical decomposition is reduced to a similar problem on the decomposition of bivectors that realizes their mass (the latter has earlier been solved by the author).

849,Analog of the monotone scheme to solve the non-self-conjugated set of quasi-diffusion equations in r–z geometry,"The way to generate the monotonous difference scheme similar to non-self-conjugated quasi-diffusion equations in r–z geometry is examined through an example of a nonstationary problem of external isotropic radiation propagation in a cylindrical pipe. For this purpose, the coordinates in a plane (r, z) are rotated in such a way that the quasi-diffusion tensor takes a diagonal form in the center of the cell and, therefore, the nondiagonal elements on the side of the cell are minimized. This scheme is similar to the scheme that we have already developed for a self-conjugated problem [1]. The following hybrid difference scheme is used in calculations: it is non-monotone in the areas of smooth solutions and is analog to monotone at the contact boundaries. Note that for the plane case the non-monotone difference scheme is invariant relative to the rotation of the coordinates. Since the front of the light wave is normal to the contact boundary, the problem of the penetration of the external radiation in the pipe is useful in verifying the quality of the scheme",E. N.

A particular example is when A is quasi-nilpotent, in which case the metric lives on the punctured complex plane ℂ {0}.

In our paper we develop differential geometry of these curves which provides basic feedback or gauge invariants for a wide class of smooth control systems and geometric structures. Two principal invariants are the generalized Ricci curvature, which is an invariant of the parametrized curve in the Lagrange Grassmannian endowing the curve with a natural projective structure, and a fundamental form, which is a fourth-order differential on the curve. The so-called rank 1 curves are studied in more detail. Jacobi curves of this class are associated with systems with scalar controls and with rank 2 vector distributions.In the forthcoming second part of the paper we will present the comparison theorems (i.e., the estimates for the conjugate points in terms of our invariants( for rank 1 curves an introduce an important class of “flat curves.”","A.

864,Geometry on Probability Spaces,"Partial differential equations and the Laplacian operator on domains in Euclidean spaces have played a central role in understanding natural phenomena. However, this avenue has been limited in many areas where calculus is obstructed, as in singular spaces, and in function spaces of functions on a space X where X itself is a function space. Examples of the latter occur in vision and quantum field theory. In vision it would be useful to do analysis on the space of images and an image is a function on a patch. Moreover, in analysis and geometry, the Lebesgue measure and its counterpart on manifolds are central. These measures are unavailable in the vision example and even in learning theory in general.There is one situation where, in the last several decades, the problem has been studied with some success. That is when the underlying space is finite (or even discrete). The introduction of the graph Laplacian has been a major development in algorithm research and is certainly useful for unsupervised learning theory.The approach taken here is to take advantage of both the classical research and the newer graph theoretic ideas to develop geometry on probability spaces. This starts with a space X equipped with a kernel (like a Mercer kernel) which gives a topology and geometry; X is to be equipped as well with a probability measure. The main focus is on a construction of a (normalized) Laplacian, an associated heat equation, diffusion distance, etc. In this setting, the point estimates of calculus are replaced by integral quantities. One thinks of secants rather than tangents. Our main result bounds the error of an empirical approximation to this Laplacian on X.",Steve Smale1 & Ding-Xuan Zhou,Constructive Approximation,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00365-009-9070-2,"Learning theory,Reproducing kernel Hilbert space,Graph Laplacian,Dimensionality reduction,Integral operator"

These notions generalize their counter parts in homogeneous Finsler geometry. We prove the correspondence between \({\mathbf {G}}\) and \(\eta \) when the given decomposition is reductive, and that between geodesics on \((G/H,{\mathbf {G}})\) and integral curves of \(-\eta \). We find the ordinary differential equations on \({\mathfrak {m}}\) describing parallel translations on \((G/H,{\mathbf {G}})\), and we calculate the S-curvature and Riemann curvature of \((G/H,{\mathbf {G}})\), generalizing L.

We use these results to define an action of the Hecke operators on the ACG of modular curves and to show that they are self-adjoint with respect to the arithmetic intersection product. The decomposition of the ACG in eigencomponents which follows allows us to define new numerical invariants, which are refined versions of the self-intersection of the dualizing sheaf. Using the Gross–Zagier formula and a calculation due independently to Bost and Kühn we compute these invariants in terms of special values of L series.

In the case that L is an almost complex or an almost para-complex structure and \((g, \omega , L)\) form a compatible triple, we show that Codazzi coupling of a torsion-free \(\nabla \) with any two of the three leads to its coupling with the remainder, which further gives rise to a (para-)Kähler structure on the manifold. This is what we call a Codazzi-(para-)Kähler structure; it is a natural generalization of special (para-)Kähler geometry, without requiring \(\nabla \) to be flat. In addition, we also prove a general result that g-conjugate, \(\omega \)-conjugate, and L-gauge transformations of \(\nabla \), along with identity, form an involutive Abelian group. Hence a Codazzi-(para-)Kähler manifold admits a pair of torsion-free connections compatible with the \((g, \omega , L)\). Our results imply that any statistical manifold may admit a (para-)Kähler structure as long as one can find an L that is compatible to g and Codazzi coupled with \(\nabla \).",Teng Fei1 & Jun Zhang,Results in Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00025-017-0711-7,"Codazzi coupling,conjugate connection,gauge transformation,Kähler structure,Para-Kähler structure,statistical manifold,Torsion"

874,"Sub-Riemannian geometry, Hamiltonian dynamics, micro-swimmers, copepod nauplii and copepod robot","The objective of this article is to present the seminal concepts and techniques of Sub-Riemannian geometry and Hamiltonian dynamics, complemented by adapted software to analyze the dynamics of the copepod micro-swimmer, where the model of swimming is the slender body approximation for Stokes flows in fluid dynamics. In this context, the copepod model is a simplification of the 3-link Purcell swimmer and is relevant to analyze more complex micro-swimmers. The mathematical model is validated by observations performed by Takagi’s team of Hawaii laboratory, showing the agreement between the predicted and observed motions. Sub-Riemannian geometry is introduced, assuming that displacements are minimizing the expanded mechanical energy of the micro-swimmer. This allows to compare different strokes and different micro-swimmers and minimizing the expanded mechanical energy of the micro-swimmer. The objective is to maximize the efficiency of a stroke (the ratio between the displacement produced by a stroke and its length). Using the Maximum Principle in the framework of Sub-Riemannian geometry, this leads to analyze family of periodic controls producing strokes to determine the most efficient one. Graded normal forms introduced in Sub-Riemannian geometry to evaluate spheres with small radius is the technique used to evaluate the efficiency of different strokes with small amplitudes, and to determine the most efficient stroke using a numeric homotopy method versus standard direct computations based on Fourier analysis. Finally a copepod robot is presented whose aim is to validate the computations and very preliminary results are given.","Bernard Bonnard1,2, Monique Chyba4, Jéremy Rouot3 & …Daisuke Takagi",Pacific Journal of Mathematics for Industry,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40736-018-0036-9,"Geometric optimal control,Sub-Riemannian geometry,Optimality conditions,Direct and indirect numerical methods in optimal control,Micro-swimmers and efficient strokes,Closed geodesics in Riemannian geometry"

The scheme \(M\) has a structure of a generically conic bundle \(M \rightarrow X\) over a double covering \(X \rightarrow Y\) ramified in the degeneration locus of \(Q \rightarrow Y\). The double covering \(X \rightarrow Y\) is singular in a finite number of points (corresponding to the points \(y \in Y\) such that the quadric \(Q_y\) degenerates to a union of two planes), the fibers of \(M\) over such points are unions of two planes intersecting in a point. The main result of the paper is a construction of a semiorthogonal decomposition for the derived category of coherent sheaves on \(M\). This decomposition has three components, the first is the derived category of a small resolution \(X^+\) of singularities of the double covering \(X \rightarrow Y\), the second is a twisted resolution of singularities of \(X\) (given by the sheaf of even parts of Clifford algebras on \(Y\)), and the third is generated by a completely orthogonal exceptional collection.","Alexander Kuznetsov1,2,",Mathematische Zeitschrift,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00209-013-1217-y,"Exceptional Collection,Semiorthogonal Decomposition,Clifford Algebra,Fano Scheme,Azumaya Algebra"

This mode of representation evolved and rapidly became standardized as the canonical way of representing like problems in genetics. Its advantages over other contemporary methods are discussed, as are ways in which it evolved to increase its power and efficiency, and responded to changing theoretical perspectives. It provided a natural visual decomposition of a complex problem into a number of inter-related stages. This explains its computational and conceptual power, for one could simply “read off” answers to a wide variety of questions simply from the “right” visual representation of the problem, and represent multiple problems, and multiple layers of problems in the same diagram.

889,Geometry and dynamics of the Schur–Cohn stability algorithm for one variable polynomials,"We provided a detailed study of the Schur–Cohn stability algorithm for Schur stable polynomials of one complex variable. Firstly, a real analytic principal \(\mathbb {C}\times \mathbb {S}^1\)-bundle structure in the family of Schur stable polynomials of degree n is constructed. Secondly, we consider holomorphic \(\mathbb {C}\)-actions \(\mathscr {A}\) on the space of polynomials of degree n. For each orbit \(\{ s \cdot P(z) \ \vert \ s \in \mathbb {C}\}\) of \(\mathscr {A}\), we study the dynamical problem of the existence of a complex rational vector field \(\mathbb {X}(z)\) on \(\mathbb {C}\) such that its holomorphic s-time describes the geometric change of the n-root configurations of the orbit \(\{ s \cdot P(z) = 0 \}\). Regarding the above \(\mathbb {C}\)-action coming from the \(\mathbb {C}\times \mathbb {S}^1\)-bundle structure, we prove the existence of a complex rational vector field \(\mathbb {X}(z)\) on \(\mathbb {C}\), which describes the geometric change of the n-root configuration in the unitary disk \(\mathbb {D}\) of a \(\mathbb {C}\)-orbit of Schur stable polynomials. We obtain parallel results in the framework of anti-Schur polynomials, which have all their roots in \(\mathbb {C}\backslash \overline{\mathbb {D}}\), by constructing a principal \(\mathbb {C}^* \times \mathbb {S}^1\)-bundle structure in this family of polynomials. As an application for a cohort population model, a study of the Schur stability and a criterion of the loss of Schur stability are described.","Baltazar Aguirre-Hernández

890,Reeb dynamics inspired by Katok’s example in Finsler geometry,"Inspired by Katok’s examples of Finsler metrics with a small number of closed geodesics, we present two results on Reeb flows with finitely many periodic orbits. The first result is concerned with a contact-geometric description of magnetic flows on the 2-sphere found recently by Benedetti. We give a simple interpretation of that work in terms of a quaternionic symmetry. In the second part, we use Hamiltonian circle actions on symplectic manifolds to produce compact, connected contact manifolds in dimension at least five with arbitrarily large numbers of periodic Reeb orbits. This contrasts sharply with recent work by Cristofaro-Gardiner, Hutchings and Pomerleano on Reeb flows in dimension three. With the help of Hamiltonian plugs and a surgery construction due to Laudenbach we reprove a result of Cieliebak: one can produce Hamiltonian flows in dimension at least five with any number of periodic orbits; in dimension three, with any number greater than one.","Peter Albers1, Hansjörg Geiges

New examples of integrable systems, which have been discovered, are based on the Lax representation of the equations of motion. These systems can be realized as straight line motions on a Jacobi variety of a so-called spectral curve. In Section 2, we study a Lie algebra theoretical method leading to integrable systems and we apply the method to several problems. In Section 3, we discuss the concept of the algebraic complete integrability (a.c.i.) of hamiltonian systems. Algebraic integrability means that the system is completely integrable in the sens of the phase space being folited by tori, which in addition are real parts of a complex algebraic tori (abelian varieties). The method is devoted to illustrate how to decide about the a.c.i. of hamiltonian systems and is applied to some examples. Finally, in Section 4 we study an a.c.i. in the generalized sense which appears as covering of a.c.i. system. The manifold invariant by the complex flow is covering of abelian variety.",A.

To fulfill this goal, by combining the \(L_p\) Asplund sum of log-concave functions for all \(p>1\) and the total mass, we obtain a Prékopa-Leindler type inequality and propose a definition for the first variation of the total mass in the \(L_p\) setting. Based on these, we further establish an \(L_p\) Minkowski type inequality related to the first variation of the total mass and derive a variational formula which motivates the definition of our \(L_p\) surface area measure for log-concave functions. Consequently, the \(L_p\) Minkowski problem for log-concave functions, which aims to characterize the \(L_p\) surface area measure for log-concave functions, is introduced. The existence of solutions to the \(L_p\) Minkowski problem for log-concave functions is obtained for \(p>1\) under some mild conditions on the pre-given Borel measures.","Niufa Fang1, Sudan Xing2 & Deping Ye",Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00526-021-02155-7,"26B25 (primary),26D10,52A40"

897,Hive geometry shapes the recruitment rate of honeybee colonies,"Honey bees make decisions regarding foraging and nest-site selection in groups ranging from hundreds to thousands of individuals. To effectively make these decisions, bees need to communicate within a spatially distributed group. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of honey bee communication have been mostly overlooked in models of collective decisions, focusing primarily on mean field models of opinion dynamics. We analyze how the spatial properties of the nest or hive, and the movement of individuals with different belief states (uncommitted or committed) therein affect the rate of information transmission using spatially-extended models of collective decision-making within a hive. Honeybees waggle-dance to recruit conspecifics with an intensity that is a threshold nonlinear function of the waggler concentration. Our models range from treating the hive as a chain of discrete patches to a continuous line (long narrow hive). The combination of population-thresholded recruitment and compartmentalized populations generates tradeoffs between rapid information propagation with strong population dispersal and recruitment failures resulting from excessive population diffusion and also creates an effective colony-level signal-detection mechanism whereby recruitment to low quality objectives is blocked.","Subekshya Bidari1 & Zachary P Kilpatrick

First, we give asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the volume of a tubular neighbourhood around the nodal set of \(\varphi _\lambda \). This extends previous work of Jakobson and Mangoubi in case (M, g) is real-analytic. A significant ingredient in our discussion are some recent techniques due to Logunov (cf. Ann Math (2) 187(1):241–262, 2018). Second, we exhibit some remarks related to the asymptotic geometry of nodal domains. In particular, we observe an analogue of a result of Cheng in higher dimensions regarding the interior opening angle of a nodal domain at a singular point. Further, for nodal domains \(\Omega _\lambda \) on which \(\varphi _\lambda \) satisfies exponentially small \(L^\infty \) bounds, we give some quantitative estimates for radii of inscribed balls.",Bogdan Georgiev1 & Mayukh Mukherjee,Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00526-019-1541-0,"Primary 58J50,Secondary 35P15,35P20,35R0,53B20"

We use this measure to define a real motivic integral which admits a change of variables formula not only for the birational but also for generically one-to-one Nash maps. As a consequence we obtain an inverse mapping theorem which holds for continuous rational maps and, more generally, for generically arc-analytic maps. These maps appeared recently in the classification of singularities of real analytic function germs.

We denote by LV systems all systems which can be brought to a Lotka–Volterra system by an affine transformation and time homotheties. All these systems possess invariant straight lines. We classify the family of LV systems according to their geometric properties encoded in the configurations of invariant straight lines which these systems possess. We obtain a total of 65 such configurations which are distinguished, roughly speaking, by the multiplicity of their invariant lines and by the multiplicities of the singularities of the systems located on these lines. We determine an algebraic subvariety of \({\mathbb{R}^{12}}\) which contains all these systems and we find the bifurcation diagram of the configurations of LV systems within this algebraic subvariety, in terms of polynomial invariants with respect to the group action of affine transformations and time homotheties.

We prove that on compact complex surfaces, in every conformal class there exists a unique metric, up to multiplication by a constant, which is extremal for the functional given by the \(L^2\)-norm of \(\mathrm{d}J\theta ,\) where J denotes the complex structure.

The equations can be of elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic type. The space region supporting the partial differential equations is decomposed and the original global optimal control problem is reduced to a sequence of similar local optimal control problems set on the subdomains. The local problems communicate through transmission conditions, which take the form of carefully chosen boundary conditions on the interfaces between the subdomains. This domain decomposition method can be combined with any suitable numerical procedure to solve the local optimal control problems. We remark that it offers a good potential for using feedback laws (synthesis) in the case of time-dependent partial differential equations. A test problem for the wave equation is solved using this combination of synthesis and domain decomposition methods. Numerical results are presented and discussed.

The open strata can have up to three connected components, due to spin and hyperelliptic structures. We prove that the spin parity can be distinguished on the boundary of the log compactification.

922,On the Geometry of Reachable Sets for Control Systems with Isoperimetric Constraints,We consider a nonlinear control system that is linear in the control variables. The control and the trajectory are subject to a system of isoperimetric constraints in the form of inequalities for integral functionals. We describe the boundary of the reachable set of the system at a given time and show that an admissible control taking the system to the boundary of the admissible set is a weakly efficient solution of a certain optimal control problem with a vector criterion if the linearized system is completely controllable. The components of the criterion are integral functionals that specify isoperimetric constraints. The stated result generalizes the authors’ earlier results to the case of several consistent integral constraints. The proof is based on the Graves theorem on covering mappings and on the properties of the derivative of the “input-output” mapping and of the constraints. The result remains valid if the initial state of the system is not fixed but belongs to a given set. The problem is reduced to a control problem with a scalar criterion depending on parameters. The Chebyshev convolution of integral functionals is chosen as the scalar criterion. Necessary conditions are obtained for the optimality of controls taking the system to the boundary of the reachable set in the form of Pontryagin’s maximum principle.,"M. I. Gusev1,2 & I. V.

It uses a slice theorem for Fréchet manifolds as the main technical tool. As a consequence, the abstract moduli space obtained by factorizing a level set of the equivariant map with respect to the group action carries the structure of a Kuranishi space, i.e., such moduli spaces are locally modeled on the quotient by a compact group of the zero set of a smooth map.

The notion of stochastic development we introduce for equinilpotentisable sub-Riemannian manifolds uses Cartan connections, which take the place of the Levi-Civita connection in Riemannian geometry. We first derive a general expression for the generator of the stochastic process which is the stochastic development with respect to a Cartan connection of the lift of Brownian motion to the model space. We further provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a Cartan connection which develops the canonical stochastic process to the sub-Riemannian diffusion associated with the sub-Laplacian defined with respect to the Popp’s volume. We illustrate the construction of a suitable Cartan connection for free sub-Riemannian structures with two generators and we discuss an example where the condition is not satisfied.","Ivan Beschastnyi

Then, we provide an approach to the study of lightlike manifolds from this point of view. It is stated that every lightlike Cartan geometry on a manifold N provides a lightlike metric h with radical distribution globally spanned by a vector field Z. For lightlike hypersurfaces of a Lorentz manifold, we give the condition that characterizes when the pull-back of the Levi-Civita connection form of the ambient manifold is a lightlike Cartan connection on such hypersurface. In the particular case that a lightlike hypersurface is properly totally umbilical, this construction essentially returns the original lightlike metric. From the intrinsic point of view, starting from a given lightlike manifold (N, h), we show a method to construct a family of ambient Lorentzian manifolds that realize (N, h) as a hypersurface. This method is inspired on the Feffermann-Graham ambient metric construction in conformal geometry and provides a lightlike Cartan geometry on the original manifold when (N, h) is generic.","Francisco J.

It generalizes to higher dimension the notion of a branched (flat) complex projective structure on a Riemann surface introduced by Mandelbaum. This new framework is much more flexible than that of the usual holomorphic Cartan geometries (e.g. all compact complex projective manifolds admit branched holomorphic projective structures).

In this two part survey, we first discuss the theory of surfaces in 3-D pseudo-hermitian manifolds. The local geometry of the surface is governed by the p-mean curvature equation. In analogy with the Gauss and Codazzi equation of a surface in Euclidean three space, we develop their analogue of these two equations. Due to the degeneracy of the p-mean curvature equation, the regularity theory is quite interesting. In the second part of this article, we describe a CR-invariant condition for the embeddability question. In CR geometry in 3-D, there is no local integrability condition for the almost-complex structure, so the condition to impose is global in nature. The condition involves two geometrically defined linear operators which have their counterparts in conformal geometry. We also formulate a notion of CR mass and discuss a positive mass theorem to characterize the Heisenberg space. The solvability of the \({\bar\partial}\) Neumann problem is also a crucial ingredient in the positivity of the CR mass.",Paul Yang,Milan Journal of Mathematics,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00032-011-0156-5,"Primary: 35L80,Secondary: 35J70,32V20,53A10,49Q10"

For symmetric spaces of higher rank, which contain isometrically embedded Euclidean planes, the situation becomes far more complicated. This paper is devoted to the study of the geometric limit set of “nonelementary” discrete isometry groups of higher rank symmetric spaces. We obtain the natural generalisations of some well-known results from Kleinian group theory. Our main tool consists in a detailed description of the dynamics of individual isometries.

An explicit proof that the usual Thom–Pontryagin construction in (co)bordism theory can be generalized also to a singular integral (co)bordism on the category of differential equations is given. In fact, we prove the existence of a spectrum that characterizes the singular integral (co)bordism groups in PDEs. Moreover, a general method that associates, in a natural way, Hopf algebras (full
p-Hopf algebras, 0 ≤ p ≤ n − 1), to any PDE, recently introduced, is further studied. Applications to particular important classes of PDEs are considered. In particular, we carefully consider the Navier–Stokes equation (NS) and explicitly calculate their quantum and integral bordism groups. An existence theorem of solutions of (NS) with a change in sectional topology is obtained. Relations between integral bordism groups and causal integral manifolds, causal tunnel effects, and the full p-Hopf algebras, 0 ≤ p ≤ 3, for the Navier–Stokes equation are determined.",Agostino Prástaro,Acta Applicandae Mathematica,1999,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1006346916360,"geometry of partial differential equations,quantum and integral (co)bordisms in PDEs,conservation laws in PDEs and Hopf algebras,Navier–Stokes equation"
963,CR geometry in 3-D,"CR geometry studies the boundary of pseudo-convex manifolds. By concentrating on a choice of a contact form, the local geometry bears strong resemblence to conformal geometry. This paper deals with the role conformally invariant operators such as the Paneitz operator plays in the CR geometry in dimension three. While the sign of this operator is important in the embedding problem, the kernel of this operator is also closely connected with the stability of CR structures. The positivity of the CR-mass under the natural sign conditions of the Paneitz operator and the CR Yamabe operator is discussed. The CR positive mass theorem has a consequence for the existence of minimizer of the CR Yamabe problem. The pseudo-Einstein condition studied by Lee has a natural analogue in this dimension, and it is closely connected with the pluriharmonic functions. The author discusses the introduction of new conformally covariant operator P-prime and its associated Q-prime curvature and gives another natural way to find a canonical contact form among the class of pseudo-Einstein contact forms. Finally, an isoperimetric constant determined by the Q-prime curvature integral is discussed.",Paul C.

Of particular interest is the realization of its real part as a conservation law for a natural geometric functional—which is, essentially, the entropy of the Gauss curvature.

The equations of motion are obtained applying Hamilton’s concept, which contain the influence of the centrifugal force, the Coriolis acceleration, and the preliminary hoop stress. In addition, the axial load is applied to the conical shell as a ratio of the global critical buckling load. The governing partial differential equations are given in the expressions of five components of displacement related to the points lying on the reference surface of the shell. Afterward, the governing differential equations are converted into a group of algebraic equations by using the GDQM. The outcomes are achieved considering the effects of stacking sequences, thickness of the shell, rotating velocities, half-vertex cone angle, and boundary conditions. Furthermore, the outcomes indicate that the rate of the convergence of frequencies is swift, and the numerical technique is superior stable. Three comparisons between the selected outcomes and those of other research are accomplished, and excellent agreement is achieved.","K. Daneshjou1, M. Talebitooti1 & R.

In particular, we apply the recent results obtained by Torres del Castillo (J. Phys. A Math. Theor. 43:265202, 2009) and deduce the Hamiltonian of a second-order ODE of the Lienard type, namely, \(\ddot{x}+f(x){\dot{x}}^{2}+g(x)=0\).

A notably simple form for the equation is obtained in the case of Riemannian geometry. The nontrivial coefficients of the Riccati equation coincide with the elements of the curvature tensor.

The criterion is given by means of geometric conditions on an equivariant holomorphic vector bundle, namely, the ‘visibility’ of the action on a base space and the multiplicity-free property on a fiber.Then, several finite-dimensional examples are presented to illustrate the general multiplicity-free theorem, in particular, explaining that three multiplicity-free results stem readily from a single geometry in our framework. Furthermore, we prove that an elementary geometric result on Grassmann varieties and a small number of multiplicity-free results give rise to all the cases of multiplicity-free tensor product representations of GL(n,C), for which Stembridge [12] has recently classified by completely different and combinatorial methods.",Toshiyuki Kobayashi,Acta Applicandae Mathematica,2004,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B%3AACAP.0000024198.46928.0c,"multiplicity-free representation,branching law,semisimple Lie group,totally real,unitary representation,flag variety,tensor product,visible action"

976,Superintegrable Hamiltonian Systems: Geometry and Perturbations,"
Many and important integrable Hamiltonian systems are ‘superintegrable’, in the sense that there is an open subset of their 2d-dimensional phase space in which all motions are linear on tori of dimension n<d. A thorough comprehension of these systems requires a description which goes beyond the standard notion of Liouville–Arnold integrability, that is, the existence of an invariant fibration by Lagrangian tori. Instead, the natural object to look at is formed by both the fibration by the (isotropic) invariant tori and by its (coisotropic) polar foliation, which together form what in symplectic geometry is called a ‘dual pair’, or ‘bifoliation’, or ‘bifibration’. We review this geometric structure, relating it to the dynamical properties of superintegrable systems and pointing out its importance for a thorough understanding of these systems.

1007,Quantum differential systems and construction of rational structures,"We consider mirror symmetry (A-side vs B-side, namely singularity side) in the framework of quantum differential systems. We focuse on the logarithmic non-resonant case, which describes the geometric situation and we show that such systems provide a good framework in order to generalize the construction of the rational structure given by Katzarkov, Kontsevich and Pantev for the complex projective space. As an application, we give a closed formula for the rational structure defined by the Lefschetz thimbles on the flat sections of the Gauss-Manin connection associated with the Landau–Ginzburg models of weighted projective spaces (a class of Laurent polynomials). As a by-product, using a mirror theorem, we get a rational structure on the orbifold cohomology of weighted projective spaces. The formula on the B-side is more complicated than the one on the A-side (the latter agrees with one of Iritani’s results), depending on numerous combinatorial data which are rearranged after the mirror transformation.",Antoine Douai,Manuscripta Mathematica,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00229-014-0678-6,"32S40,14J33,34M35"

Akivis and V. V. Goldberg. Investigation of (p, q, r)-webs, including algebraic and geometric theory aspects, has been continued in our papers, in particular, we found the structure equations of a three-web W(p, q, r), where p = λl, q = λm, and r = λ(l + m − 1). For such webs, we define the notion of a generalized Reidemeister configuration and proved that a three-web W(λl, λm, λ(l + m − 1)), on which all sufficiently small generalized Reidemeister configurations are closed, is generated by a λ-dimensional Lie group G. The structure equations of the web are connected with the Maurer–Cartan equations of the group G. We define generalized Reidemeister and Bol configurations for three-webs W(p, q, q). It is proved that a web W(p, q, q) on which generalized Reidemeister or Bol configurations are closed is generated, respectively, by the action of a local smooth q-parametric Lie group or a Bol quasigroup on a smooth p-dimensional manifold.

Numerical simulations show that the Gaussian curvature can generate vorticity, and non-uniformity of the Gaussian curvature is the main cause. In the cylindrical wake, the bump dominated by the positive Gaussian curvature can significantly affect the vortex street by forming velocity depression and changing vorticity transport. The results may provide possibilities for manipulating surface flows through local change in the surface geometry.","Qian Shi1, Yu Chen1 & Xilin Xie",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-017-2238-8,"two-dimensional flow,vorticity dynamics,incompressible viscous,curvature"

1030,The Geometry of Spontaneous Spiking in Neuronal Networks,"The mathematical theory of pattern formation in electrically coupled networks of excitable neurons forced by small noise is presented in this work. Using the Freidlin–Wentzell large-deviation theory for randomly perturbed dynamical systems and the elements of the algebraic graph theory, we identify and analyze the main regimes in the network dynamics in terms of the key control parameters: excitability, coupling strength, and network topology. The analysis reveals the geometry of spontaneous dynamics in electrically coupled network. Specifically, we show that the location of the minima of a certain continuous function on the surface of the unit n-cube encodes the most likely activity patterns generated by the network. By studying how the minima of this function evolve under the variation of the coupling strength, we describe the principal transformations in the network dynamics. The minimization problem is also used for the quantitative description of the main dynamical regimes and transitions between them. In particular, for the weak and strong coupling regimes, we present asymptotic formulas for the network activity rate as a function of the coupling strength and the degree of the network. The variational analysis is complemented by the stability analysis of the synchronous state in the strong coupling regime. The stability estimates reveal the contribution of the network connectivity and the properties of the cycle subspace associated with the graph of the network to its synchronization properties.

The parametrisation obtained in this manner is reminiscent of that associated with elliptic billiards.

1035,The Geometry of Off-the-Grid Compressed Sensing,"Compressed sensing (CS) ensures the recovery of sparse vectors from a number of randomized measurements proportional to their sparsity. The initial theory considers discretized domains, and the randomness makes the physical positions of the grid nodes irrelevant. Most imaging devices, however, operate over some continuous physical domain, and it makes sense to consider Dirac masses with arbitrary positions. In this article, we consider such a continuous setup and analyze the performance of the BLASSO algorithm, which is the continuous extension of the celebrated LASSO \(\ell ^1\) regularization method. This approach is appealing from a numerical perspective because it avoids to discretize the domain of interest. Previous works considered translation-invariant measurements, such as randomized Fourier coefficients, in which it makes clear that the discrete theory should be extended by imposing a minimum distance separation constraint (often called “Rayleigh limit”) between the Diracs. These prior works, however, rule out many domains and sensing operators of interest, which are not translation invariant. This includes, for instance, Laplace measurements over the positive reals and Gaussian mixture models over the mean-covariance space. Our theoretical advances crucially rely on the introduction of a canonical metric associated with the measurement operator, which is the so-called Fisher geodesic distance. In the case of Fourier measurements, one recovers the Euclidean metric, but this metric can cope with arbitrary (possibly non-translation invariant) domains. Furthermore, it is naturally invariant under joint reparameterization of both the sensing operator and the Dirac locations. Our second and main contribution shows that if the Fisher distance between spikes is larger than a Rayleigh separation constant, then the BLASSO recovers in a stable way a stream of Diracs, provided that the number of measurements is proportional (up to log factors) to the number of Diracs. We measure the stability using an optimal transport distance constructed on top of the Fisher geodesic distance. Our result is (up to log factor) sharp and does not require any randomness assumption on the amplitudes of the underlying measure. Our proof technique relies on an infinite-dimensional extension of the so-called golfing scheme which operates over the space of measures and is of general interest.","Clarice Poon1, Nicolas Keriven2 & Gabriel Peyré",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-021-09545-5,"Compressed sensing,Off the grid,LASSO,BLASSO,Fisher distance,Wasserstein distance"
1036,Slice-polynomial functions and twistor geometry of ruled surfaces in \(\mathbb {CP}^3\),"In the present paper we introduce the class of slice-polynomial functions: slice regular functions defined over the quaternions, outside the real axis, whose restriction to any complex half-plane is a polynomial. These functions naturally emerge in the twistor interpretation of slice regularity introduced in Gentili et al. (J Eur Math Soc 16(11):2323–2353, 2014) and developed in Altavilla (J Geom Phys 123:184–208, 2018). To any slice-polynomial function P we associate its companion\(P^\vee \) and its extension to the real axis \(P_{\mathbb {R}}\), that are quaternionic functions naturally related to P. Then, using the theory of twistor spaces, we are able to show that for any quaternion q the cardinality of simultaneous pre-images of q via P, \(P^\vee \) and \(P_{\mathbb {R}}\) is generically constant, giving a notion of degree. With the brand new tool of slice-polynomial functions, we compute the twistor discriminant locus of a cubic scroll \(\mathcal {C}\) in \(\mathbb {CP}^3\) and we conclude by giving some qualitative results on the complex structures induced by \(\mathcal {C}\) via the twistor projection.",A.

In this paper, we introduce the em algorithm, an information geometric formulation of the EM algorithm, and its extensions and applications to various problems. Specifically, we will see that it is possible to formulate an outlier–robust inference algorithm, an algorithm for calculating channel capacity, parameter estimation methods on probability simplex, particular multivariate analysis methods such as principal component analysis in a space of probability models and modal regression, matrix factorization, and learning generative models, which have recently attracted attention in deep learning, from the geometric perspective provided by Amari.","Hideitsu Hino

1038,Mixed curvature measures of translative integral geometry,"The curvature measures of a set X with singularities are measures concentrated on the normal bundle of X, which describe the local geometry of the set X. For given finitely many convex bodies or, more generally, sets with positive reach, the translative integral formula for curvature measures relates the integral mean of the curvature measures of the intersections of the given sets, one fixed and the others translated, to the mixed curvature measures of the given sets. In the case of two sets of positive reach, a representation of these mixed measures in terms of generalized curvatures, defined on the normal bundles of the sets, is known. For more than two sets, a description of mixed curvature measures in terms of rectifiable currents has been derived previously. Here we provide a representation of mixed curvature measures of sets with positive reach based on generalized curvatures. The special case of convex polyhedra is treated in detail.","Daniel Hug

More specifically, a new singular vortex theory is presented for regularized Euler fluid equations of ideal incompressible flow in the plane. We determine the conditions under which such regularized Euler fluid equations may admit vorticity singularities which are stronger than delta functions, e.g., derivatives of delta functions. We also describe the symplectic geometry associated with these augmented vortex structures, and we characterize the dynamics as Hamiltonian. Applications to the design of numerical methods similar to vortex blob methods are also discussed. Such findings illuminate the rich dynamics which occur below the regularization length scale and enlighten our perspective on the potential for regularized fluid models to capture multiscale phenomena.",Darryl D.

1041,A ‘geometric’ view of the dynamics of trajectories of computer programs,"This paper applies mathematical ideas which arise from differential geometry and control theory to computer programming theory. For the sake of simplicity, most questions of logic and language are put to the side. A computer program is regarded as a collection of data, considered as a collection of cross-sections of a fiber space whose base is a discrete space. These distinguished cross-sections are called the trajectories of the computer program system. For the simplest von Neumann type of program, the base space is the nonnegative integers: The trajectories may then often be thought of as the orbits of a discretetime dynamical system. Feedback control theory enters when one attempts to provide a ‘rational’ way of generating such dynamical systems, satisfying certain conditions, such as termination and correctness. The greatest common divisor and bubble sort programs — standard examples in computer science textbooks — are treated as models for the development of a general theory.Geometrically, we will also consider them as the discrete analogue of what are called path systems in differential geometry. These examples can also be treated as the analogue of closed-loop feedback control systems — themselves a sort of path system — that are ‘driven’ to the final answer by a process that is similar to the way that Lyapunov theory is used in the linear regulator problem of control theory. This use of the Lyapunov ideas of dynamical system theory gives a technique for proving the correctness and termination of some programs. In order to provide a mathematical structure to a programming theory that is, in some sense, analogous to the group-theoretic structure of fiber bundle differential geometry, an algebraic structure of a category which acts on the fiber space is associated with such programs. The computation of the binomial coefficients will also be treated as an example of a system of partial difference equations, leading to the description of some features of concurrent programs. Prolongations and correspondences are defined for programs, based on the analogous ideas for differential systems. Finally, some of the geometric background of modal logic is developed, particularly as it is used in following the temporal development of computer programs. The approach is related to the classical geometric notion of correspondence, and to the Jonsson-Tarski theory of operators on Boolean algebras.",Robert Hermann,Acta Applicandae Mathematica,1990,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00046564,"03G30,06B30,03B35,6802,68G15,68C05,9302,93C55,81D15"

$$|G|=\inf_{u}\{\max\{|u_{1}|,|u_{2}|\} | G=u_{1} F_{1}+u_{2} F_{2}\}. $$ If F1 and F2 are not proportional at p, then we obtain a Finslerian structure; if not, the structure is sub-Finslerian on a distribution with non-constant rank.

We define and characterize reversible exponential families of Markov kernels, and show that irreducible and reversible Markov kernels form both a mixture family and, perhaps surprisingly, an exponential family in the set of all stochastic kernels. We propose a parametrization of the entire manifold of reversible kernels, and inspect reversible geodesics. We define information projections onto the reversible manifold, and derive closed-form expressions for the e-projection and m-projection, along with Pythagorean identities with respect to information divergence, leading to some new notion of reversiblization of Markov kernels. We show the family of edge measures pertaining to irreducible and reversible kernels also forms an exponential family among distributions over pairs. We further explore geometric properties of the reversible family, by comparing them with other remarkable families of stochastic matrices. Finally, we show that reversible kernels are, in a sense we define, the minimal exponential family generated by the m-family of symmetric kernels, and the smallest mixture family that comprises the e-family of memoryless kernels.","Geoffrey Wolfer

The resulting dynamical system is a core structure for many dynamical phenomena such as slow spiking and bursting.

1072,Multiscale Geometry of the Olsen Model and Non-classical Relaxation Oscillations,"We study the Olsen model for the peroxidase–oxidase reaction. The dynamics is analyzed using a geometric decomposition based on multiple timescales. The Olsen model is four-dimensional, not in a standard form required by geometric singular perturbation theory and contains multiple small parameters. These three obstacles are the main challenges we resolve by our analysis. Scaling and the blow-up method are used to identify several subsystems. The results presented here provide a rigorous analysis for two oscillatory modes. In particular, we prove the existence of non-classical relaxation oscillations in two cases. The analysis is based on desingularization of lines of transcritical and submanifolds of fold singularities in combination with an integrable relaxation phase. In this context, our analysis also explains an assumption that has been utilized, based purely on numerical reasoning, in a previous bifurcation analysis by Desroches et al. (Discret Contin Dyn Syst S 2(4):807–827, 2009). Furthermore, the geometric decomposition we develop forms the basis to prove the existence of mixed-mode and chaotic oscillations in the Olsen model, which will be discussed in more detail in future work.",Christian Kuehn1 & Peter Szmolyan,Journal of Nonlinear Science,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00332-015-9235-z,"Olsen model,Multiple timescales,Relaxation oscillation, Geometric singular perturbation theory,Blow-up method,Bifurcation delay"

Here we analyze in detail the seminal 1974 work by H.L. Resnikoff, who showed that there are only two possible geometric structures and Riemannian metrics on the perceived color space \(\mathcal{P} \) compatible with the set of Schrödinger’s axioms completed with the hypothesis of homogeneity. We recast Resnikoff’s model into a more modern colorimetric setting, provide a much simpler proof of the main result of the original paper, and motivate the need of psychophysical experiments to confute or confirm the linearity of background transformations, which act transitively on \(\mathcal{P} \). Finally, we show that the Riemannian metrics singled out by Resnikoff through an axiom on invariance under background transformations are not compatible with the crispening effect, thus motivating the need of further research about perceptual color metrics.","Edoardo Provenzi

The paper deals with the studies on functionals of random processes, some problems of stochastic geometry, and problems associated with ordered systems of random variables. The first sections of the paper are devoted to the problems of calculating the distributions of various functionals of Brownian motion and consider the so-called invariance principles for Brownian local times and random walks. The second part is dedicated to limit theorems for weakly dependent random variables and local limit theorems for stochastic functionals. It provides information about the stratification method and the local invariance principle. The asymptotic behavior of the convex hulls of random samples of increasing size and limit theorems for random zonotopes are also considered. An important relation between Poisson point processes and stable distributions is explained. The final part presents extensive information on research related to ordered systems of random variables. The maxima of sequential sums, order statistics, and record values are analyzed in detail.","A. N. Borodin1,2, Yu. A. Davydov1 & V. B.

As a corollary, two such groups are quasiisometric if and only if they are commensurable, and any finitely-generated group quasi-isometric to \( \Gamma \) must be weakly commensurable with \( \Gamma \). We use quasi-isometries to compute Comm(\( \Gamma \)) explicitly, an example of how quasi-isometries can actually detect finite-index information. The proofs of these theorems involve ideas from coarse topology, Teichmüller geometry, pseudo-Anosov dynamics, and singular SOLV geometry.

It is well known that the conformal group of a nonconformally-flat spacetime is atmost seven-dimensional and that seven is attained for certain pp-waves.

s
 is a smooth, constant-volume deformation of the canonical metric that is not formally trivial, the length of the shortest periodic geodesic of the metric g

s
 attains π as a strict local maximum at s = 0. This result still holds for complex and quaternionic projective spaces as well as for the Cayley plane. Moreover, the same techniques can be applied to show that Zoll Finsler manifolds are the unique smooth critical points of the systolic volume.

The traditional statement of the problem consists in determining the integrand. We consider the case of an underdetermined problem when the unknown functions depend on a greater number of variables than the given integrals. These situations appear in a few applied problems when a rather complicated mathematical model is used and no a priori information is available. For overcoming the lack of appropriate data, we pose the problem of finding part of the information unknown; namely, we search only for the discontinuity surfaces of the integrand. The corresponding uniqueness theorem is proved. The present paper finalizes our studies into the case of integration over one-dimensional manifolds. In the previous articles we considered similar problems in the case of integration over straight lines.

In general, for each \(p,q \in [1, +\infty )\), the pullback map along a uniform map does not induce a morphism between the spaces of p-integrable forms or even in \(L^{q,p}\)-cohomology. Then our goal is to introduce, for each p in \([1, +\infty )\) and for each uniform map f between manifolds of bounded geometry, an \({\mathcal {L}}^p\)-bounded operator \(T_f\), such that it does induce in a functorial way the appropriate morphism in reduced and unreduced \(L^{q,p}\)-cohomology.","Stefano Spessato

Questions, related to the application of the ideas of global analysis to optimal control problems, are considered. A theory of Lyusternik-Shnirelman type is constructed for Hilbert manifolds with singularities, the so-called transversally convex subsets. Conditions for the nondegeneracy of the critical points (the extremal controls) are established in the optimal control problem, related to a smooth control system of constant rank, and a formula for their Morse index is given.",S.

1112,Computing quasiconformal maps using an auxiliary metric and discrete curvature flow,"Surface mapping plays an important role in geometric processing, which induces both area and angular distortions. If the angular distortion is bounded, the mapping is called a quasiconformal mapping (QC-Mapping). Many surface mappings in our physical world are quasiconformal. The angular distortion of a QC mapping can be represented by the Beltrami differentials. According to QC Teichmüller theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of Beltrami differentials and the set of QC surface mappings under normalization conditions. Therefore, every QC surface mapping can be fully determined by the Beltrami differential and reconstructed by solving the so-called Beltrami equation. In this work, we propose an effective method to solve the Beltrami equation on general Riemann surfaces. The solution is a QC mapping associated with the prescribed Beltrami differential. The main strategy is to define an auxiliary metric (AM) on the domain surface, such that the original QC mapping becomes conformal under the auxiliary metric. The desired QC-mapping can then be obtained by using the conventional conformal mapping method. In this paper, we first formulate a discrete analogue of QC mappings on triangular meshes. Then, we propose an algorithm to compute discrete QC mappings using the discrete Yamabe flow method. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to compute the discrete QC mappings for general Riemann surfaces, especially with different topologies. Numerically, the discrete QC mapping converges to the continuous solution as the mesh grid size approaches to 0. We tested our algorithm on surfaces scanned from real life with different topologies. Experimental results demonstrate the generality and accuracy of our auxiliary metric method.","Wei Zeng1, Lok Ming Lui2, Feng Luo3, Tony Fan-Cheong Chan4, Shing-Tung Yau5 & …David Xianfeng Gu",Numerische Mathematik,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-012-0446-z,"65,52,30"

1116,Recent results on the Kobayashi and Green-Griffiths-Lang conjectures,"The study of entire holomorphic curves contained in projective algebraic varieties is intimately related to fascinating questions of geometry and number theory—especially through the concepts of curvature and positivity which are central themes in Kodaira’s contributions to mathematics. The aim of these lectures is to present recent results concerning the geometric side of the problem. The Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture stipulates that for every projective variety X of general type over ℂ, there exists a proper algebraic subvariety Y of X containing all entire curves f : ℂ → X. Using the formalism of directed varieties and jet bundles, we show that this assertion holds true in case X satisfies a strong general type condition that is related to a certain jet-semi-stability property of the tangent bundle TX. It is possible to exploit similar techniques to investigate a famous conjecture of Shoshichi Kobayashi (1970), according to which a generic algebraic hypersurface of dimension n and of sufficiently large degree d ⩾ dn in the complex projective space ℙn+1 is hyperbolic: in the early 2000’s, Yum-Tong Siu proposed a strategy that led in 2015 to a proof based on a clever use of slanted vector fields on jet spaces, combined with Nevanlinna theory arguments. In 2016, the conjecture has been settled in a different way by Damian Brotbek, making a more direct use of Wronskian differential operators and associated multiplier ideals; shortly afterwards, Ya Deng showed how the proof could be modified to yield an explicit value of dn. We give here a short proof based on a substantial simplification of their ideas, producing a bound very similar to Deng’s original estimate, namely \({d_n} = \left\lfloor {{1 \over 3}{{(en)}^{2n + 2}}} \right\rfloor \).",Jean-Pierre Demailly,Japanese Journal of Mathematics,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11537-019-1566-3,"Kobayashi hyperbolic variety,directed manifold,genus of a curve,jet bundle,jet differential,jet metric,Chern connection and curvature,negativity of jet curvature,variety of general type,Kobayashi conjecture,Green-Griffiths conjecture,Lang conjecture"

It is an effective approach to dealing with response variables having a multimodal distribution or those contaminated by outliers. Because of the semiparametric nature of MLR, constructing a statistical model manifold is difficult with the conventional approach. To overcome this difficulty, we first consider the information geometric perspective of the modal expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm. Based on this perspective, model manifolds for MLR are constructed according to observations, and a data manifold is constructed based on the empirical distribution. In this paper, the em algorithm, which is a geometric formulation of the EM algorithm, of MLR is shown to be equivalent to the conventional EM algorithm of MLR. The robustness of the MLR model is also discussed in terms of the influence function and information geometry.","Keishi Sando1, Shotaro Akaho2,3, Noboru Murata3,4 & …Hideitsu Hino

This is the natural generalization of the well known almost Kählerian structure on T(M). We found conditions under which T(M) is almost Kählerian, locally conformal Kählerian or Kählerian or when T(M) has constant sectional curvature or constant scalar curvature. Then we will restrict to the unit tangent bundle and we find an isometry with the tangent sphere bundle (not necessary unitary) endowed with the restriction of the Sasaki metric from T(M).

As it turns out, this method displays a range of interesting geometrical features that yield insights and sets out general strategies for geometric time discretizations of Hamiltonian systems on non-canonical symplectic manifolds. In particular, our study provides two new, completely geometric proofs that the discrete-time spin systems obtained by the spherical midpoint method preserve symplecticity. The study follows two paths. First, we introduce an extended version of the Hopf fibration to show that the spherical midpoint method can be seen as originating from the classical midpoint method on \(T^*\mathbf {R}^{2n}\) for a collective Hamiltonian. Symplecticity is then a direct, geometric consequence. Second, we propose a new discretization scheme on Riemannian manifolds called the Riemannian midpoint method. We determine its properties with respect to isometries and Riemannian submersions, and, as a special case, we show that the spherical midpoint method is of this type for a non-Euclidean metric. In combination with Kähler geometry, this provides another geometric proof of symplecticity.","Robert I. McLachlan1, Klas Modin

We discuss the construction of these models, and we emphasize the role played by Brownian motion indexed by the Brownian tree.",Jean-François Le Gall,Japanese Journal of Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11537-019-1821-7,"Random geometry,Brownian sphere,Brownian disk,random planar map,scaling limit,Gromov-Hausdorff convergence,tree-indexed Brownian motion,Brownian tree"
1141,Large deviations in the geometry of convex lattice polygons,"We provide a full large deviation principle (LDP) for the uniform measure on certain ensembles of convex lattice polygons. This LDP provides for the analysis of concentration of the measure on convex closed curves. In particular, convergence to a limiting shape results in some particular cases, including convergence to a circle when the ensemble is defined as those centered convex polygons, with vertices on a scaled two dimensional lattice, and with length bounded by a constant. The Gauss-Minkowskii transform of convex curves plays a crucial role in our approach.","A. Vershik1,2 & O.

1142,Quaternionic geometry of matroids,"Building on a recent paper [8], here we argue that the combinatorics of matroids are intimately related to the geometry and topology of toric hyperkähler varieties. We show that just like toric varieties occupy a central role in Stanley’s proof for the necessity of McMullen’s conjecture (or g-inequalities) about the classification of face vectors of simplicial polytopes, the topology of toric hyperkähler varieties leads to new restrictions on face vectors of matroid complexes. Namely in this paper we will give two proofs that the injectivity part of the Hard Lefschetz theorem survives for toric hyperkähler varieties. We explain how this implies the g-inequalities for rationally representable matroids. We show how the geometrical intuition in the first proof, coupled with results of Chari [3], leads to a proof of the g-inequalities for general matroid complexes, which is a recent result of Swartz [20]. The geometrical idea in the second proof will show that a pure O-sequence should satisfy the g-inequalities, thus showing that our result is in fact a consequence of a long-standing conjecture of Stanley.",Tamás Hausel,Central European Journal of Mathematics,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.2478/BF02475653,"

1153,Invariants for feedback equivalence and Cauchy characteristic multifoliations of nonlinear control systems,"Linearization of a nonlinear feedback control system under nonlinear feedback is treated as a problem of equivalence-under the Lie pseudogroup of feedback transformations-of distributions on the product manifold of the state and control variables. The new feature of this paper is that it introduces the Cauchy characteristic sub-distributions of these distributions and their derived distributions. These Cauchy characteristic distributions are involutive and nested, hence define a Multifoliate Structure. A necessary condition for feedback equivalence of two nonlinear control systems is that these multifoliations be transformed under the feedback pseudogroup. For linear systems, this Cauchy characteristic multifoliate structuee is readily computed in terms of the (A, B)-matrix that defines the linear system. Assuming that the conditions for local feedback linearization are satisfied, the existence of a global feedback linearizing transformation is dependent on computing an element of the first cohomology group of the space with coefficients in the sheaf of groupoid of infinitesimal feedback automorphisms of the linear system. The theorem quoted above about the Cauchy characteristic multifoliations provides some information about this groupoid. It is computed explicitly and directly for control systems with one- or two-state dimensions. Finally, these Cauchy characteristic sub-distributions must inevitably play a role in the numerical or symbolic computational analysis of the Hunt-Su partial differential equations for the feedback-linearizing transformation.",Robert Hermann,Acta Applicandae Mathematica,1988,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00047284,"58A30,93C15"

Histories of the movement of catastrophe manifolds and bifurcation sets are presented for some of the space-equivalent unfoldings described by Wassermann (1975). These unfoldings provide descriptions of the variation with time of the stability of stationary states of associated potential energy functions. Identification of these stationary energy states with stationary states of a system therefore provides a description of its behavior with time. Qualitative descriptions of this type are particularly useful when the complexity of a system prevents a detailed quantitative description. Histories of bifurcation set movements suggest different types of system behavior at different space-like coordinates. This type of theory may be a useful model for the processes leading to differentiation of cells and to emergence of adult forms of a biological organism.",A. E. R.

1157,Infinite bubbling in non-Kählerian geometry,"In a holomorphic family \({(X_b)_{b\in B}}\) of non-Kählerian compact manifolds, the holomorphic curves representing a fixed 2-homology class do not form a proper family in general. The deep source of this fundamental difficulty in non-Kähler geometry is the explosion of the area phenomenon: the area of a curve \({C_b\subset X_b}\) in a fixed 2-homology class can diverge as b → b
0. This phenomenon occurs frequently in the deformation theory of class VII surfaces. For instance it is well known that any minimal GSS surface X
0 is a degeneration of a 1-parameter family of simply blown up primary Hopf surfaces \({(X_z)_{z\in D{\setminus}\{0\}}}\) , so one obtains non-proper families of exceptional divisors \({E_z\subset X_z}\) whose area diverge as z → 0. Our main goal is to study in detail this non-properness phenomenon in the case of class VII surfaces. We will prove that, under certain technical assumptions, a lift \({\widetilde E_z}\) of E

z
 in the universal cover \({\widetilde X_z}\) does converge to an effective divisor \({\widetilde E_0}\) in \({\widetilde X_0}\) , but this limit divisor is not compact. We prove that this limit divisor is always bounded towards the pseudo-convex end of \({\widetilde X_0}\) and that, when X
0 is a minimal surface with global spherical shell, it is given by an infinite series of compact rational curves, whose coefficients can be computed explicitly. This phenomenon—degeneration of a family of compact curves to an infinite union of compact curves—should be called infinite bubbling. We believe that such a decomposition result holds for any family of class VII surfaces whose generic fiber is a blown up primary Hopf surface. This statement would have important consequences for the classification of class VII surfaces.",Georges Dloussky1 & Andrei Teleman,Mathematische Annalen,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00208-011-0713-9,"32Q65,32Q57,32Q55"

1159,Second Homotopy Group and Invariant Geometry of Flag Manifolds,"We use the Hopf fibration to explicitly compute generators of the second homotopy group of the flag manifolds of a compact Lie group. We show that these 2-spheres have nice geometrical properties such as being totally geodesic surfaces with respect to any invariant metric on the flag manifold, generalizing a result in Burstall and Rawnsley (Springer Lect. Notes Math. 2(84):1424, 1990). This illustrates how “rubber-band” topology can, in the presence of symmetry, single out very rigid objects. We characterize when these 2-spheres in the same homotopy class have the same geometry for all invariant metrics. This is done by exploring the action of Weyl group of the flag manifold, generalizing results of Patrão and San Martin (Indag. Math. 26:547–579, 2015) and de Siebenthal (Math. Helvetici 44(1):1–3, 1969). This illustrates how some aspects of “continuum” invariant geometry can, in the presence of symmetry, be reduced to the study of discrete objects. We remark that the topology singling out very rigid objects and the study of a continuum object being reduced to discrete ones is a characteristic of situations with a lot of symmetry and, thus, are recurring themes in Lie theory.

The concept of starshapedness is very close to that of convexity, and it is needed in fields like classical convexity, convex analysis, functional analysis, discrete, combinatorial and computational geometry, differential geometry, approximation theory, PDE, and optimization; it is strongly related to notions like radial functions, section functions, visibility, (support) cones, kernels, duality, and many others.

This shift has created interest in computational aspects of differential geometry, and solving optimization problems that incorporate non-linear geometry constitutes an important computational task. In this paper, we develop methods for numerically solving optimization problems over spaces of geodesics using numerical integration of Jacobi fields and second order derivatives of geodesic families. As an important application of this optimization strategy, we compute exact Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA), a non-linear version of the PCA dimensionality reduction procedure. By applying the exact PGA algorithm to synthetic data, we exemplify the differences between the linearized and exact algorithms caused by the non-linear geometry.

For non-positive curvature, we show that the graph admits no cut locus and we give a description of the boundary structure of distance balls. For negative curvature, we prove that the interiors of minimal bigons are empty and derive explicit bounds for the growth of distance balls and Cheeger’s constant. The latter are used to obtain lower bounds for the bottom of the spectrum of the discrete Laplace operator. Moreover, we give a characterization for triviality of the essential spectrum by uniform decrease of the curvature.

Then we explain why it is so difficult to find examples, other than trivial ones, of spaces having at least two closed, conformal and homothetic vector fields. We then focus on isometric immersions, firstly generalizing a theorem of J. Simons on cones with parallel mean curvature to spaces furnished with a closed, Ricci null conformal vector field; then we prove general Bernstein-type theorems for certain complete, not necessarily cmc, hypersurfaces of Riemannian manifolds furnished with closed conformal vector fields.

1167,Unfolding the torus: Oscillator geometry from time delays,"We present a simple method of plotting the trajectories of systems of weakly coupled oscillators. Our algorithm uses the time delays between the “firings” of the oscillators. For any system ofn weakly coupled oscillators there is an attracting invariantn-dimensional torus, and the attractor is a subset of this invariant torus. The invariant torus intersects a suitable codimension-1 surface of section at an (n−1)-dimensional torus. The dynamics ofn coupled oscillators can thus be reduced,in principle, to the study of Poincaré maps of the (n−1)-dimensional torus. This paper gives apractical algorithm for measuring then−1 angles on the torus. Since visualization of 3 (or higher) dimensional data is difficult we concentrate onn=3 oscillators. For three oscillators, a standard projection of the Poincaré map onto the plane yields a projection of the 2-torus which is 4-to-1 over most of the torus, making it difficult to observe the structure of the attractor. Our algorithm allows a direct measurement of the 2 angles on the torus, so we can plot a 1-to-1 map from the invariant torus to the “unfolded torus” where opposite edges of a square are identified. In the cases where the attractor is a torus knot, the knot type of the attractor is obvious in our projection.",P. Ashwin1 & J. W.

We show that this rapidity metric agrees with the classical Poincaré metric resp. the Cayley-Klein metric resp. the Bergman metric. We introduce the Lorentz boost of vectors in B, which turns out to be a loop isomorphism. It induces a similarity of metrics between the rapidity metric of the Einstein or Möbius loop and the trace metric on positive definite matrices restricted to the Lorentz boosts.",Sejong Kim1 & Jimmie Lawson,Results in Mathematics,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00025-012-0265-7,"15B48,20N05,83A05"
1173,"Geometry and Identity Theorems
for Bicomplex Functions and Functions of a Hyperbolic Variable","Let \(\mathbb{D}\) be the two-dimensional real algebra generated by 1 and by a
hyperbolic unit k such that \(k^{2} = 1\). This algebra is often referred to as the algebra of hyperbolic numbers. A function \(f : \mathbb{D} \rightarrow \mathbb{D}\) is called \(\mathbb{D}\)-holomorphic in a domain \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{D}\)  if it admits derivative in the sense that \({\rm lim}_{h\rightarrow{0}}\frac{f({\mathfrak{z}_{0}+h)} -f{(\mathfrak{z}_{0})}} {h}\) exists for every point \(\mathfrak{z}_0\) in \(\Omega\), and when h is only allowed to be an invertible hyperbolic number. In this paper we prove that \(\mathbb{D}\)-holomorphic functions satisfy
an unexpected limited version of the identity theorem. We will offer two distinct
proofs that shed some light on the geometry of \(\mathbb{D}\). Since hyperbolic numbers are
naturally embedded in the four-dimensional algebra of bicomplex numbers, we
use our approach to state and prove an identity theorem for the bicomplex case
as well.","Maria Elena Luna–Elizarrarás1, Marco Panza2,3, Michael Shapiro1 & …Daniele Carlo Struppa",Milan Journal of Mathematics,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00032-020-00313-8,Primary 30G35

We study this invariant from the view point of locally conformally Kähler geometry. We first see that we can define an integral invariant for coverings of compact complex manifolds with automorphic volume forms. This situation typically occurs for locally conformally Kähler manifolds. Secondly, we see that this invariant coincides with the former one.

The trees were ordered by the methods of Horsfield and Strahler. Delta, the difference between the Horsfield orders of the two branches at a bifurcation, was determined by pseudorandom numbers generated according to a distribution of probabilities defined on input. By trial and error a distribution was found which resulted in trees being generated with average Strahler order branching ratios of 2.82, similar to a real bronchial tree. Branching angles and length ratio could also be defined on input. By varying these input parameters it was found that the form of the tree was quite sensitive to them, and that by a suitable choice the intrasegmental part of the bronchial tree could be simulated. It is concluded that branching ratio, length ratio, mean branching angles and distribution of delta are controlled within tight limits in the bronchial tree, and this may support the concept of optimal design.",Keith Horsfield1 & Alison Thurlbeck,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,1984,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02462014,"Length Ratio,Pseudorandom Number,Bronchial Tree,Branching Ratio,Daughter Branch"

One of the main results is that a bijection of the set of all Laguerre cycles which preserves contact in one direction must already be a Lie transformation (THEOREM 2). As a first consequence of this theorem we get that a bijection of an arbitrary real pre-Hilbert space of dimension at least 3 which preserves Lorentz-Minkowski distance 0 in one direction must already be a (proper or improper) Lorentz boost up to a dilatation, a translation and an orthogonal mapping (THEOREM 3). This is a generalization of results of A.D. Alexandroff [1], E.M. Schröder [21] and F. Cacciafesta [7]. Another consequence is that a bijection of the set of all Lie cycles which preserves contact in one direction must already be a Lie transformation (THEOREM 4). If we apply this result to the finite dimensional case, we get that the diffeomorphism assumption in the Fundamental Theorem of Lie sphere geometry as stated in Theorem 1.5 in T.E.

An infinite set of quadratic invariants of the Koopman operator is specified, which are pairwise in involution with respect to the corresponding symplectic structure. For transformations with a discrete spectrum and a Lebesgue spectrum, these quadratic invariants are functionally independent and form a complete involutive set, which suggests that the Koopman transform is completely integrable."," V.

We study flow lines of the vector field \(e^{i(h/\chi +\theta )}\) starting at a fixed boundary point of the domain. Letting \(\theta \) vary, one obtains a family of curves that look locally like \(\hbox {SLE}_\kappa \) processes with \(\kappa \in (0,4)\) (where \(\chi = \tfrac{2}{\sqrt{\kappa }} -\tfrac{ \sqrt{\kappa }}{2}\)), which we interpret as the rays of a random geometry with purely imaginary curvature. We extend the fundamental existence and uniqueness results about these paths to the case that the paths intersect the boundary. We also show that flow lines of different angles cross each other at most once but (in contrast to what happens when h is smooth) may bounce off of each other after crossing. Flow lines of the same angle started at different points merge into each other upon intersecting, forming a tree structure. We construct so-called counterflow lines (\(\hbox {SLE}_{16/\kappa }\)) within the same geometry using ordered “light cones” of points accessible by angle-restricted trajectories and develop a robust theory of flow and counterflow line interaction. The theory leads to new results about \(\hbox {SLE}\). For example, we prove that \(\hbox {SLE}_\kappa (\rho )\) processes are almost surely continuous random curves, even when they intersect the boundary, and establish Duplantier duality for general \(\hbox {SLE}_{16/\kappa }(\rho )\) processes.","Jason Miller1,2 nAff3 & Scott Sheffield",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-016-0698-0,60J67

The observation that the square on the diagonal of a rectangle was the sum of the squares on the sides found an immediate ritual application. Its elaboration in the sacrificial ritual gave it a dominant position in ancient thought and ensured its conservation for thousands of years. This initial elaboration took place well before 2000 B.C. By 2000 B.C., it was already old and had diffused parts of itself into Egypt and Babylonia (unless, indeed, one of these places was the homeland of the elaboration). These parts became the basis of a new development in these centers. The new, big development was the solution of the quadratic. A thousand years and more later, Greece inherited algebra from Babylonia, but its geometry has more of an Indian than a Babylonian look. It inherited geometric algebra, the problem of squaring the circle, the problem of expressing √2 rationally, and some notions of proof.",A.

1197,Categorical Geometry and Integration Without Points,"The theory of integration over infinite-dimensional spaces is known to encounter serious difficulties. Categorical ideas seem to arise naturally on the path to a remedy. Such an approach was suggested and initiated by Segal in his pioneering article (Segal, Bull Am Math Soc 71:419–489, 1965). In our paper we follow his ideas from a different perspective, slightly more categorical, and strongly inspired by the point-free topology. First, we develop a general (point-free) concept of measurability (extending the standard Lebesgue integration when applying to the classical σ-algebra). Second (and here we have a major difference from the classical theory), we prove that every finite-additive function μ with values in [0,1] can be extended to a measure on an abstract σ-algebra; this correspondence is functorial and yields uniqueness. As an example we show that the Segal space can be characterized by completely canonical data.

1205,Fast High-Order Integral Equation Methods for Solving Boundary Value Problems of Two Dimensional Heat Equation in Complex Geometry,"Efficient high-order integral equation methods have been developed for solving boundary value problems of the heat equation in complex geometry in two dimensions. First, the classical heat potential theory is applied to convert such problems to Volterra integral equations of the second kind via the heat layer potentials, where the unknowns are only on the space–time boundary. However, the heat layer potentials contain convolution integrals in both space and time whose direct evaluation requires \(O(N_S^2N_T^2)\) work and \(O(N_SN_T)\) storage, where \(N_S\) is the total number of discretization points on the spatial boundary and \(N_T\) is the total number of time steps. In order to evaluate the heat layer potentials accurately and efficiently, they are split into two parts—the local part containing the temporal integration from \(t-\delta \) to t and the history part containing the temporal integration from 0 to \(t-\delta \). The local part can be dealt with efficiently using conventional fast multipole type algorithms. For problems with complex stationary geometry, efficient separated sum-of-exponentials approximations are constructed for the heat kernel and used for the evaluation of the history part. Here all local and history kernels are compressed only once. The resulting algorithm is very efficient with quasilinear complexity in both space and time for both interior and exterior problems. For problems with complex moving geometry, the spectral Fourier approximation is applied for the heat kernel and nonuniform FFT is used to speed up the evaluation of the history part of heat layer potentials. The performance of both algorithms is demonstrated with several numerical examples.","Shaobo Wang1, Shidong Jiang1 & Jing Wang1,",Journal of Scientific Computing,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-018-0872-x,"Heat equation,Integral equation methods,High-order methods,Heat kernels,Sum-of-exponentials approximation,Nonuniform FFT"
1206,On the Geometry of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle in Banach Spaces,A basic idea of the classical approach to obtain necessary optimality conditions in the calculus of variations and optimal control is to perturb with suitable variations the reference trajectory and then compare the unperturbed value of the cost functional with the perturbed one. Here we compare several classes of variations for the study of infinite-dimensional optimal control problems. We prove an abstract result on a non-separation property of two closed sets and obtain as corollaries versions of the maximum principle under various assumptions.

1213,Prodromes of Descriptive Geometry in the Traité de stéréotomie by Amédée François Frézier,"Among the sciences involved in the theorization of descriptive geometry, the stereotomy played a prominent role. The knowledge of the theory of the surfaces of which bodies are made up, their plane sections, their intersections, the representation methods to control the design operations in the plane, is the core of stereotomic design. This makes the stereotomy the forerunner, in terms of theory and tools, of modern descriptive geometry. A seminal essay is the 1737–1739 Traité de stéréotomie by Amédée François Frézier. This work, published a few years before Monge’s Géométrie descriptive, summarize the descriptive geometry’s state-of-the-art in that period. Notably in the first book, Frézier publishes an original study about the intersections between quadric surfaces and the projective-geometrical properties of the fourth-order curves derived from them. 
On sait que les procédés plus ou moins ingénieux employés depuis longtemps dans la coupe des pierres et la charpente ont conduit Monge à la création de la géométrie descriptive. Les secrets d’ateliers réunis, classés, et surtout rattachés à un petit nombre de principes, ont constitué les éléments d’une branche importante des sciences appliquées. Aujourd’hui la géométrie descriptive est enseignée d’une manière indépendante des questions qui lui ont donné naissance; néanmoins, parmi ses applications les plus utiles, il faut citer le tracé des épures relatives à la coupe des pierres et à la charpente. La plupart des exercices à traiter se rapportent à l’intersection des surfaces

1217,The Structural Effects of Micro-Geometry on Masonry Vaults,"Masonry vaults are able to withstand their dead load and external forces thanks to their curved surface, therefore geometry plays a major role in their structural behaviour. Besides the well-known effects of the macro-geometry (overall shape and dimensions), micro-geometry (details of the masonry apparatus) is also expected to play a key role. The study seeks to determine the advantages (constructional and structural) that a specific masonry apparatus offered for simple forms like barrel vaults and more complex forms like cross vaults. It is carried out, firstly, through a critical review of the European technical literature concerning vault construction with particular focus on brick laying techniques; then, numerical approach is adopted to scientifically investigate the role of micro-geometry on the static behaviour of barrel and cross vaults subjected to self-weight. Comparison of results allows observing different structural behaviour (displacement field, elastic stiffness, reaction forces) for different brick patterns and provides a scientific validation to some speculations found in historical technical literature.","Marco Alforno

Although these represent a unique example of complex vernacular architecture, an in-depth analysis of their geometric features has not been carried out. This paper aims to fill that gap, and includes a review of their historical origin and a description of their most common building typologies. The building technique is reviewed in all its stages in order to point out the important relation between construction, structural behaviour and final shape of the building. Furthermore, morphologies and proportions of 30 existing trulli are investigated, by means of virtual three-dimensional models obtained by a combination of laser-scanner and geo-radar surveying. The high-fidelity geometric models offer a new interpretation of their architecture. Moreover, this study highlights the lack of a systematic and consistent building methodology of trulli.","Leonardo Todisco

We employ a result of Gardiner and Netuka on the concentration of this measure to obtain an interesting geometric statement about sums of angles of the farthest point Voronoi cells. These results are extended to polytopes in higher dimensions, and evidence in support of a conjecture made by Laugesen and Pritsker on the concentration of the measure is provided.",W.

1240,"Geometry and equisingularity of finitely determined map germs from \({\mathbb {C}}^n\) to \({\mathbb {C}}^3\), \(n >2\)
","In this article we describe the geometry and the Whitney equisingularity of finitely determined map germs \(f{:} ({\mathbb {C}}^n,0) \rightarrow ( {\mathbb {C}}^3,0)\) with \(n \ge 3\). In the study of the geometry, we first investigate the critical locus \(\Sigma (f)\) of the germ, which is in the source. Then the discriminant \(\Delta (f)\), the image of the critical locus by the germ f, is studied. Last, but not least we investigate the set X(f), which is the inverse image by f of the discriminant. If the critical locus is not empty, the set X(f) is an hypersurface in the source that has nonisolated singularity at the origin. Concerning the Whitney equisingularity of families, we use some of the properties of the strata to prove that the Whitney equisingularity of an unfolding F is equivalent to the constancy of the Lê numbers of the hypersurfaces \(\Delta (f)\) and X (f). From this study we describe some relationship among the invariants needed to describe the Whitney equisingularity of families in these dimensions, we reduce the number of invariants needed to a total of \(2n+2\), which improves substantially the number required by Gaffney’s theorem.","A.

1244,Spatial aspects in the SMAD signaling pathway,"Among other approaches, differential equations are used for a deterministic quantitative description of time-dependent biological processes. For intracellular systems, such as signaling pathways, most existing models are based on ordinary differential equations. These models describe temporal processes, while they neglect spatial aspects. We present a model for the SMAD signaling pathway, which gives a temporal and spatial description on the basis of reaction diffusion equations to answer the question whether cell geometry plays a role in signaling. In this article we simulate the ordinary differential equations as well as partial differential equations of parabolic type with suile numerical methods, the latter on different cell geometries. In addition to manual construction of idealized cells, we also construct meshes from microscopy images of real cells. The main focus of the paper is to compare the results of the model without and with spatial aspects to answer the addressed question. The results show that diffusion in the model can lead to significant intracellular gradients of signaling molecules and changes the level of response to the signal transduced by the signaling pathway. In particular, the extent of these observations depends on the geometry of the cell.","J. Claus1, E. Friedmann2, U. Klingmüller3, R. Rannacher2 & …T.

In the present paper, we prove that the only ruled Laguerre minimal surfaces are up to isometry the surfaces \({\mathbf{R}(\varphi,\lambda) = ( A\varphi,\, B\varphi,\, C\varphi + D\cos 2\varphi\, ) + \lambda\left(\sin \varphi,\, \cos \varphi,\, 0\,\right)}\), where \({A,B,C,D\in \mathbb{R}}\) are fixed. To achieve invariance under Laguerre transformations, we also derive all Laguerre minimal surfaces that are enveloped by a family of cones. The methodology is based on the isotropic model of Laguerre geometry. In this model a Laguerre minimal surface enveloped by a family of cones corresponds to a graph of a biharmonic function carrying a family of isotropic circles. We classify such functions by showing that the top view of the family of circles is a pencil.","Mikhail Skopenkov1 nAff2, Helmut Pottmann3 & Philipp Grohs",Mathematische Zeitschrift,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00209-011-0953-0,"Laguerre geometry,Laguerre minimal surface,Ruled surface,Biharmonic function"
1247,Continuous and Smooth Envelopes of Topological Algebras. Part 1,"Since the first optical instruments were invented, an idea that the visible image of an object under observation depends on tools of observation became commonly assumed in physics. A way of formalizing this idea in mathematics is the construction that assigns to an arbitrary object A in a category K its envelope \( {\mathrm{Env}}_{\Phi}^{\Omega}A \) in a given class of morphisms (a class of representations) Ω with respect to a given class of morphisms (a class of observation tools) Φ. It turns out that if we take a sufficiently wide category of topological algebras as K, then each choice of the classes Ω and Φ defines a “projection of functional analysis into geometry,” and the standard “geometric disciplines,” like complex geometry, differential geometry, and topology, become special cases of this construction. This gives a formal scheme of “categorical construction of geometries” with many interesting applications, in particular, “geometric generalizations of the Pontryagin duality” (to the classes of noncommutative groups). In this paper we describe this scheme in topology and in differential geometry.",S. S.

In this work, we make some extensions of this theory to the case of a nonlinear Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping that is constructed using a solution to a fully nonlinear elliptic equation in a given domain, mapping Dirichlet data to its normal derivative of the resulting solution. Here we begin the process of giving detailed information about the Lévy measures that will result from the integro-differential representation of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping. We provide new results about both linear and nonlinear Dirichlet-to-Neumann mappings.

The current structure-preserving method satisfies the requirements that a symplectic method can preserve the symplectic structure of a finite dimension Hamiltonian system, and a multi-symplectic method can preserve the multi-symplectic structure of an infinite dimension Hamiltonian system. In this paper, the structure-preserving properties of three differential schemes for an oscillator system are investigated in detail. Both the theoretical results and the numerical results show that the results obtained by the standard forward Euler scheme lost all the three geometric properties of the oscillator system, i.e., periodicity, boundedness, and total energy, the symplectic scheme can preserve the first two geometric properties of the oscillator system, and the Störmer-Verlet scheme can preserve the three geometric properties of the oscillator system well. In addition, the relative errors for the Hamiltonian function of the symplectic scheme increase with the increase in the step length, suggesting that the symplectic scheme possesses good structure-preserving properties only if the step length is small enough.","Yu-yue Qin

To do this, one should divide by a Hecke-gauge groupoid. Tame harmonic bundles on X give preferred sections, and the relative tangent bundle along a preferred section has a mixed twistor structure with weights 0, 1, 2. The weight 2 piece corresponds to the deformations of the KMS structure including parabolic weights and the residues of the \(\lambda \)-connection.","Carlos Simpson

1274,Flag Partial Differential Equations and Representations of Lie Algebras,"Flag partial differential equations naturally appear in the problem of decomposing the polynomial algebra (symmetric tensor) over an irreducible module of a Lie algebra into the direct sum of its irreducible submodules. Many important linear partial differential equations in physics and geometry are also of flag type. In this paper, we use the grading technique in algebra to develop the methods of solving such equations. In particular, we find new special functions by which we are able to explicitly give the solutions of the initial value problems of a large family of constant-coefficient linear partial differential equations in terms of their coefficients. As applications to representations of Lie algebras, we find certain explicit irreducible polynomial representations of the Lie algebras

Based on comparisons which have been made between the gained solutions by AGM, numerical method (Runge–Kutte 4th), variational iteration method and energy balanced method, it is possible to indicate that AGM can be successfully applied for various differential equations .Vibrational equations and solving them by AGM will be introduced firstly, and afterwards the application of AGM will be shown in the specified problems. It is noteworthy that this method has some valuable advantages, for instance in this approach, it is not necessary to utilize dimensionless parameters in order to simplify equation. So there is no need to convert the variables to new ones that heightens the complexity of the problem. More over by utilizing AGM, the shortage of boundary condition(s) for solving differential equation will be terminated by using derivatives of main differential equation(s). The results prove that this method is very effective, simple, reliable and can be applied for many other nonlinear problems.",Navid Balazadeh Meresht1 & D. D.

Given two distinct points of the surface, the surface normals at these points either are disjoint or meet at the distance from both of these points bounded below by some fixed positive constant. We establish that every surface of this type carries in a neighborhood of each point a parametrization with bounded second order generalized derivatives in the sense of Sobolev. The proof is based on using geometric properties of the surfaces of this form and on the proposition that establishes sufficient conditions for the existence of bounded second order generalized derivatives of an arbitrary real function.

1281,Toward a Solution of the Active Target Defense Differential Game,"A novel pursuit-evasion differential game involving three agents is considered. An Attacker missile is pursuing a Target aircraft. The Target aircraft is aided by a Defender missile launched by, say, the wingman, to intercept the Attacker before it reaches the Target aircraft. Thus, a team is formed by the Target and the Defender which cooperate to maximize the separation between the Target aircraft and the point where the Attacker missile is intercepted by the Defender missile, while at the same time the Attacker tries to minimize said distance. A long-range Beyond Visual Range engagement which is in line with current CONcepts of OPeration is envisaged, and it is therefore assumed that the players have simple motion kinematics á la Isaacs. Also, the speed of the Attacker is equal to the speed of the Defender and the latter is interested in point capture. It is also assumed that at all time the Attacker is aware of the Defender’s position, i.e., it is a perfect information game. The analytic/closed-form solution of the target defense pursuit-evasion differential game delineates the state space region where the Attacker can reach the Target without being intercepted by the Defender, thus disposing of the Game of Kind. The target defense Game of Degree is played in the remaining state space. The analytic solution of the Game of Degree yields the agents’ optimal state feedback strategies, that is, the instantaneous heading angles for the Target and the Defender team to maximize the terminal separation between Target and Attacker at the instant of interception of the Attacker by the Defender, and also the instantaneous optimal heading for the Attacker to minimize said separation. Their calculation hinges on the real-time solution of a quartic equation. In this paper we contribute to the solution of a differential game with three states—an additional example to the, admittedly small, repertoire of pursuit-evasion differential games in 3-D which can be solved in closed form.","Meir Pachter1, Eloy Garcia

1283,Equivalence and symmetries of first order differential equations,"In this article, the equivalence and symmetries of underdetermined differential equations and differential equations with deviations of the first order are considered with respect to the pseudogroup of transformations \( \bar x = \phi (x), \bar y = \bar y(\bar x) = L(x)y(x) \). That means, the transformed unknown function \( \bar y \) is obtained by means of the change of the independent variable and subsequent multiplication by a nonvanishing factor. Instead of the common direct calculations, we use some more advanced tools from differential geometry; however, the exposition is self-contained and only the most fundamental properties of differential forms are employed. We refer to analogous achievements in literature. In particular, the generalized higher symmetry problem involving a finite number of invariants of the kind \( F^j = a_j y \prod \left| {z_i } \right|^{k_i^j } = a_j y\left| {z_1 } \right|^{k_1^j } \ldots \left| {z_m } \right|^{k_m^j } = a_j (x)y\left| {y(\xi _1 )} \right|^{k_1^j } \ldots \left| {y(\xi _m )} \right|^{k_m^j } \) is compared to similar results obtained by means of auxiliary functional equations.",V.

1284,Geometry Behind Chordal Loewner Chains,"Loewner Theory is a deep technique in Complex Analysis affording a basis for many further important developments such as the proof of famous Bieberbach’s conjecture and well-celebrated Schramm’s stochastic Loewner evolution. It provides analytic description of expanding domains dynamics in the plane. Two cases have been developed in the classical theory, namely the radial and the chordal Loewner evolutions, referring to the associated families of holomorphic self-mappings being normalized at an internal or boundary point of the reference domain, respectively. Recently there has been introduced a new approach (Bracci F et al. in Evolution families and the Loewner equation I: the unit disk. Preprint 2008. Available on ArXiv 0807.1594; Bracci F et al. in Math Ann 344:947–962, 2009; Contreras MD et al. in Loewner chains in the unit disk. To appear in Revista Matemática Iberoamericana; preprint available at arXiv:0902.3116v1 [math.CV]) bringing together, and containing as quite special cases, radial and chordal variants of Loewner Theory. In the framework of this approach we address the question what kind of systems of simply connected domains can be described by means of Loewner chains of chordal type. As an answer to this question we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of simply connected domains to be the range of a generalized Loewner chain of chordal type. We also provide an easy-to-check geometric sufficient condition for that. In addition, we obtain analogous results for the less general case of chordal Loewner evolution considered in (Aleksandrov IA et al. in Complex Analysis.

Therefore we plan to present essentials of one special approach to “super-mathematics”, so called functional superanalysis (in the spirit of De Witt, Rogers, Vladimirov and Volovich, and the author of this review) in compact and clear form in series of review-type papers. This first paper is a review on super-differential calculus for the concrete model of the superspace (invented by Vladimirov and Volovich). In the next review we plan to present the integral supercalculus. The main distinguishing feature of functional superanalysis is that this is a real super-extension of analysis of Newton and Leibniz, opposite to algebraic models of Martin and Berezin. Here functions of commuting and anticommuting variables are no simply algebraic elements belonging to Grassmann algebras, but point-wise maps, from superspace into superspace. Finally, we remark that the first non-Archimedean physical model was based on invention by Vladimirov and Volovich of superspaces based on supercommutative Banach superalgebras over non-Archimedean (in particular, p-adic) fields.

This paper deals with a guidance law based on a linear-quadratic differential game formulation. This guidance law has many attractive properties: it is continuous, linear with respect to the state variables, and its gain coefficients can be precalculated offline. Nevertheless, due to the lack of hard control constraints in the formulation, the magnitude of the control can exceed the admissible level imposed by the nature of the problem. In this paper, the upper bound of the interceptor control is obtained depending on the system parameters and the penalty coefficients of the game performance index. It is shown that the interceptor can guarantee an arbitrarily small miss distance without exceeding the control constraints if it has sufficient maneuverability and if the penalty coefficients are chosen properly. By manipulating the penalty coefficients, it is possible to reduce significantly the maneuverability requirements compared to the case of zero interceptor penalty coefficient.",V.

We present a technique for the rapid and reliable optimization of systems characterized by linear-functional outputs of coercive elliptic partial differential equations with affine (input) parameter dependence. The critical ingredients are: reduced-basis approximation to effect significant reduction in state-space dimensionality; a posteriori error bounds to provide rigorous error estimation and control; “offline/online” computational decompositions to permit rapid evaluation of output bounds, output bound gradients, and output bound Hessians in the limit of many queries; and reformulation of the approximate optimization statement to ensure (true) feasibility and control of suboptimality. To illustrate the method we consider the design of a three-dimensional thermal fin: Given volume and power objective-function weights, and root temperature “not-to-exceed” limits, the optimal geometry and heat transfer coefficient can be determined—with guaranteed feasibility—in only 2.3 seconds on a 500 MHz Pentium machine; note the latter includes only the online component of the calculations. Our method permits not only interactive optimal design at conception and manufacturing, but also real-time reliable adaptive optimal design in operation.

1305,Perturbation of sectorial projections of elliptic pseudo-differential operators,"Over a closed manifold, we consider the sectorial projection of an elliptic pseudo-differential operator A of positive order with two rays of minimal growth. We show that it depends continuously on A when the space of pseudo-differential operators is equipped with a certain topology which we explicitly describe. Our main application deals with a continuous curve of arbitrary first order linear elliptic differential operators over a compact manifold with boundary. Under the additional assumption of the weak inner unique continuation property, we derive the continuity of a related curve of Calderón projections and hence of the Cauchy data spaces of the original operator curve. In the Appendix, we describe a topological obstruction against a verbatim use of R. Seeley’s original argument for the complex powers, which was seemingly overlooked in previous studies of the sectorial projection.","Bernhelm Booß-Bavnbek1, Guoyuan Chen2, Matthias Lesch3 & …Chaofeng Zhu",Journal of Pseudo-Differential Operators and Applications,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11868-011-0042-5,"Sectorial projections,Elliptic operators,Pseudo-differential operators,Non-symmetric operators,Calderón projection,Cauchy data spaces"

1307,The Geometry of Marked Contact Engel Structures,"A contact twisted cubic structure \(({\mathcal M},\mathcal {C},{\varvec{\upgamma }})\) is a 5-dimensional manifold \({\mathcal M}\) together with a contact distribution \(\mathcal {C}\) and a bundle of twisted cubics \({\varvec{\upgamma }}\subset \mathbb {P}(\mathcal {C})\) compatible with the conformal symplectic form on \(\mathcal {C}\). The simplest contact twisted cubic structure is referred to as the contact Engel structure; its symmetry group is the exceptional group \(\mathrm {G}_2\). In the present paper we equip the contact Engel structure with a smooth section \(\sigma : {\mathcal M}\rightarrow {\varvec{\upgamma }}\), which “marks” a point in each fibre \({\varvec{\upgamma }}_x\). We study the local geometry of the resulting structures \(({\mathcal M},\mathcal {C},{\varvec{\upgamma }}, \sigma )\), which we call marked contact Engel structures. Equivalently, our study can be viewed as a study of foliations of \({\mathcal M}\) by curves whose tangent directions are everywhere contained in \({\varvec{\upgamma }}\). We provide a complete set of local invariants of marked contact Engel structures, we classify all homogeneous models with symmetry groups of dimension \(\ge 6\) up to local equivalence, and we prove an analogue of the classical Kerr theorem from Relativity.","Gianni Manno

The phase variables are allele frequency and population density. The genotype fitnesses are not assumed to be monotonically decreasing functions of density. Hence the mean fitness curve is more complicated than in the monotonic case. If genotype fitnesses are only density dependent, results concerning equilibrium stability are obtained similar to those for the monotonic case, and periodic solutions are precluded in the differential equation model. An example with one-hump genotype fitnesses is presented and analyzed.",James F.

In this paper we apply the method based on entropy measures to obtain a Riemannian metric based on (h, Φ)-entropy measures (Salicrú et al., 1993). The geodesic distances based on that information metric have been computed for a number of parametric families of distributions. The use of geodesic distances in testing statistical hypotheses is illustrated by an example within the Pareto family.

This semigroup of Hamiltonian operators, which we call the symplectic semigroup, is studied from the viewpoint of Lie semigroup theory, and resulting consequences for the theory of the Riccati equation are delineated.

This question appears at first somewhat surprising since “model” is such a standard term now in the discourse on mathematics and “modelling” such a standard activity that it seems to be well established since long. The paper shows that the term— in the intended epistemological meaning—emerged rather recently and tries to reveal in which mathematical contexts it became established. The paper discusses various layers of argumentations and reflections in order to unravel and reach the pertinent kernel of the issue. The specific points of this paper are the difference in the epistemological concept to the usually discussed notions of model and the difference between conceptions implied in mathematical practices and their becoming conscious in proper reflections of mathematicians.,"Gert Schubring

Along with a few general remarks on applications of complex geometry and theory of residues, we present new results obtained in this way. Most of the new results are presented in the case of a planar quadrilateral linkage with generic lengths of the sides. First, we show that, for each configuration of planar quadrilateral linkage Q(a, b, c, d) with pairwise distinct side-lengths (a, b, c, d), the cross-ratio of its vertices belongs to the circle of radius ac/bd centered at the point \( 1\in \mathbb{C} \). Next, we establish an analog of the Poncelet porism for a discrete dynamical system on a planar moduli space of a 4-bar linkage defined by the product of diagonal involutions and discuss some related issues suggested by a beautiful link to the theory of discrete integrable systems discovered by J. Duistermaat. We also present geometric results concerned with the electrostatic energy of point charges placed at the vertices of a quadrilateral linkage. In particular, we establish that all convex shapes of a quadrilateral linkage arise as the global minima of a system of charges placed at its vertices, and these shapes can be completely controlled by the value of the charge at just one vertex, which suggests a number of interesting problems. In conclusion, we describe a natural connection between certain extremal problems for configurations of linkage and convex polyhedra obtained from its configurations using the Minkowski 1897 theorem and present a few related remarks.",G.

1342,The de Rham–Hodge Analysis and Modeling of Biomolecules,"Biological macromolecules have intricate structures that underpin their biological functions. Understanding their structure–function relationships remains a challenge due to their structural complexity and functional variability. Although de Rham–Hodge theory, a landmark of twentieth-century mathematics, has had a tremendous impact on mathematics and physics, it has not been devised for macromolecular modeling and analysis. In this work, we introduce de Rham–Hodge theory as a unified paradigm for analyzing the geometry, topology, flexibility, and Hodge mode analysis of biological macromolecules. Geometric characteristics and topological invariants are obtained either from the Helmholtz–Hodge decomposition of the scalar, vector, and/or tensor fields of a macromolecule or from the spectral analysis of various Laplace–de Rham operators defined on the molecular manifolds. We propose Laplace–de Rham spectral-based models for predicting macromolecular flexibility. We further construct a Laplace–de Rham–Helfrich operator for revealing cryo-EM natural frequencies. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed de Rham–Hodge paradigm is one of the most versatile tools for the multiscale modeling and analysis of biological macromolecules and subcellular organelles. Accurate, reliable, and topological structure-preserving algorithms for implementing discrete exterior calculus (DEC) have been developed to facilitate the aforementioned modeling and analysis of biological macromolecules. The proposed de Rham–Hodge paradigm has potential applications to subcellular organelles and the structure construction from medium- or low-resolution cryo-EM maps, and functional predictions from massive biomolecular datasets.","Rundong Zhao1, Menglun Wang2, Jiahui Chen2, Yiying Tong1 & …Guo-Wei Wei

1343,Short Loop Decompositions of Surfaces and the Geometry of Jacobians,"Given a Riemannian surface, we consider a naturally embedded graph which captures part of the topology and geometry of the surface. By studying this graph, we obtain results in three different directions.First, we find bounds on the lengths of homologically independent curves on closed Riemannian surfaces. As a consequence, we show that for any \({\lambda \in (0, 1)}\) there exists a constant C
λ such that every closed Riemannian surface of genus g whose area is normalized at 4π (g – 1) has at least [λg] homologically independent loops of length at most C
λ log(g). This result extends Gromov’s asymptotic log(g) bound on the homological systole of genus g surfaces. We construct hyperbolic surfaces showing that our general result is sharp. We also extend the upper bound obtained by P. Buser and P. Sarnak on the minimal norm of nonzero period lattice vectors of Riemann surfaces in their geometric approach of the Schottky problem to almost g homologically independent vectors.Then, we consider the lengths of pants decompositions on complete Riemannian surfaces in connexion with Bers’ constant and its generalizations. In particular, we show that a complete noncompact Riemannian surface of genus g with n ends and area normalized to \({4\pi(g + \frac{n}{2}-1)}\) admits a pants decomposition whose total length (sum of the lengths) does not exceed C

1344,"On the Geometry of Rolling and Interpolation Curves on S
n, SO
n
, and Grassmann Manifolds","We present a procedure to generate smooth interpolating curves on submanifolds, which are given in closed form in terms of the coordinates of the embedding space. In contrast to other existing methods, this approach makes the corresponding algorithm easy to implement. The idea is to project the prescribed data on the manifold onto the affine tangent space at a particular point, solve the interpolation problem on this affine subspace, and then project the resulting curve back on the manifold. One of the novelties of this approach is the use of rolling mappings. The manifold is required to roll on the affine subspace like a rigid body, so that the motion is described by the action of the Euclidean group on the embedding space. The interpolation problem requires a combination of a pullback/push forward with rolling and unrolling. The rolling procedure by itself highlights interesting properties and gives rise to a new, but simple, concept of geometric polynomial curves on manifolds. This paper is an extension of our previous work, where mainly the 2-sphere case was studied in detail. The present paper includes results for the n-sphere, orthogonal group SO
n
, and real Grassmann manifolds. In particular, we present the kinematic equations for rolling these manifolds along curves without slip or twist, and derive from them formulas for the parallel transport of vectors along curves on the manifold.","K.

Based on description of deflection of well axis and on analysis of three dimensional forces of a small section of drill string, equilibrium differential equations of large deflection drill string were established. The internal forces were found by Longe-Kutta method. The stresses were found by using them and the strength prerequisite was established. Stresses of drill string in lateral horizontal well H767 were computed. The results are in agreement with those of finite element model and soft-rope rigidified model.

A fundamental ingredient has been the easy availability of symbolic computation systems to accomplish the extensive calculations usually involved in applications; to this end the interactive website http://www.alltypes.de has been provided. Although originally only developed for ordinary equations, it has been extended to large classes of partial equations as well. In the first part Loewy’s results for ordinary equations are outlined. Thereafter those results of differential algebra are summarized that are required for extending Loewy’s theory to partial equations. In the remaining part a fairly complete discussion of second- and some third-order partial differential equations in the plane is given; it is shown that Loewy’s result remains essentially true for these equations.

1358,Algebraic geometry of topological spaces I,"We use techniques from both real and complex algebraic geometry to study K-theoretic and related invariants of the algebra C(X) of continuous complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff topological space X. For example, we prove a parameterized version of a theorem by Joseph Gubeladze; we show that if M is a countable, abelian, cancellative, torsion-free, semi-normal monoid, and X is contractible, then every finitely generated projective module over C(X)[M] is free. The particular case \( M = \mathbb{N}_0^n \) gives a parameterized version of the celebrated theorem proved independently by Daniel Quillen and Andrei Suslin that finitely generated projective modules over a polynomial ring over a field are free. The conjecture of Jonathan Rosenberg which predicts the homotopy invariance of the negative algebraic K-theory of C(X) follows from the particular case \( M = {\mathbb{Z}^n} \). We also give algebraic conditions for a functor from commutative algebras to abelian groups to be homotopy invariant on C
*-algebras, and for a homology theory of commutative algebras to vanish on C
*-algebras. These criteria have numerous applications. For example, the vanishing criterion applied to nil K-theory implies that commutative C
*-algebras are K-regular. As another application, we show that the familiar formulas of Hochschild–Kostant–Rosenberg and Loday–Quillen for the algebraic Hochschild and cyclic homology of the coordinate ring of a smooth algebraic variety remain valid for the algebraic Hochschild and cyclic homology of C(X).

For this purpose, we use a lemma on the Hölder regularity of limits of contractive refinement schemes in metric spaces. In combination with earlier results on smoothness of limits, we settle the question of existence of interpolatory refinement rules intrinsic to Riemannian geometry which have \(C^r\) limits for all input data, for \(r \le 3\).

1360,A regularity method for lower bounds on the Lyapunov exponent for stochastic differential equations,"We put forward a new method for obtaining quantitative lower bounds on the top Lyapunov exponent of stochastic differential equations. Our method combines (i) a new identity connecting the top Lyapunov exponent to a Fisher information-like functional of the stationary density of the Markov process tracking tangent directions with (ii) a novel, quantitative version of Hörmander’s hypoelliptic regularity theory in an \(L^1\) framework which estimates this (degenerate) Fisher information from below by a \(W^{s,1}_{\mathrm {loc}}\) Sobolev norm. This method is applicable to a wide range of systems beyond the reach of currently existing mathematically rigorous methods. As an initial application, we prove the positivity of the top Lyapunov exponent for a class of weakly-dissipative, weakly forced stochastic differential equations; in this paper we prove that this class includes the Lorenz 96 model in any dimension, provided the additive stochastic driving is applied to any consecutive pair of modes.","Jacob Bedrossian1, Alex Blumenthal2 & Sam Punshon-Smith",Inventiones mathematicae,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-021-01069-7,"Primary: 37H15,35H10,Secondary: 37D25,58J65,35B65"

These are normal almost contact metric manifolds that admit a unique compatible connection with \( 3 \)-form torsion. Any odd-dimensional compact Lie group is shown to admit such a structure; in this case, the structure is left-invariant and has closed torsion form. We illustrate the relation between st structures and other generalisations of Sasaki geometry, and we explain how some standard constructions in Sasaki geometry can be adapted to this setting. In particular, we relate the st structure to a kt structure on the space of leaves and show that both the cylinder and the cone over an st manifold are kt , although only the cylinder behaves well with respect to closedness of the torsion form. Finally, we introduce a notion of ‘\( G \)-moment map’.

In this paper, we consider this construction in the presence of infinitesimal symmetries of the two geometries. First, we prove that the submaximally symmetric c-projective model with type (1, 1) curvature is a submanifold of a submaximally symmetric quaternionic model and show how this fits into the construction. We give conditions for when the c-projective symmetries extend from the fixed-point set of the circle action to quaternionic symmetries, and we study the quaternionic symmetries of the Calabi and Eguchi–Hanson hyperkähler structures, showing that in some cases all quaternionic symmetries are obtained in this way.","Aleksandra Borówka1 & Henrik Winther

PINNs are nowadays used to solve PDEs, fractional equations, integral-differential equations, and stochastic PDEs.

This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages. The review also attempts to incorporate publications on a broader range of collocation-based physics informed neural networks, which stars form the vanilla PINN, as well as many other variants, such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN). The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been used, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than classical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements are still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.","Salvatore Cuomo1 na1, Vincenzo Schiano Di Cola2 na1, Fabio Giampaolo1 na1, Gianluigi Rozza3 na1, Maziar Raissi4 na1 & …Francesco Piccialli

We study the geometry of ODE systems for which this torsion vanishes. These are the ODE systems for which deformations of solutions fixing a point constitute a field of Segré varieties in the tangent bundle of the locally defined space of solutions. Conversely, a field of Segré varieties for which certain differential invariants vanish induces a torsion-free ODE system on the space of solutions to a natural PDE system. The geometry on the solution space is used to produce first integrals for torsion-free ODE systems, given as algebraic invariants of a curvature tensor involving up to fourth derivatives of the equations. In the generic case, there are enough first integrals to solve the equations explicitly in spite of the absence of symmetry. In the case of torsion-free ODE pairs, the field of Segré varieties is equivalent to a half-flat split signature conformal structure, and we characterize in terms of curvature those systems having an abundance of totally geodesic surfaces.",D.A.

By this coordinate transformation, the reversible effects of advection are separated from the irreversible joint effects of advection and diffusion. In this framework, LCSs express themselves as (boundaries of) metastable sets under the Lagrangian diffusion process. In the case of spatially homogeneous isotropic diffusion, averaging the time-dependent family of Lagrangian diffusion operators yields Froyland’s dynamic Laplacian. In the associated geometric heat equation, the distribution of heat is governed by the dynamically induced intrinsic geometry on the material manifold, to which we refer as the geometry of mixing. We study and visualize this geometry in detail, and discuss connections between geometric features and LCSs viewed as diffusion barriers in two numerical examples. Our approach facilitates the discovery of connections between some prominent methods for coherent structure detection: the dynamic isoperimetry methodology, the variational geometric approaches to elliptic LCSs, a class of graph Laplacian-based methods and the effective diffusivity framework used in physical oceanography.","Daniel Karrasch

1373,Geometric configurations of singularities for quadratic differential systems with three distinct real simple finite singularities,"In this work we classify, with respect to the geometric equivalence relation, the global configurations of singularities, finite and infinite, of quadratic differential systems possessing exactly three distinct finite simple singularities. This relation is finer than the topological equivalence relation which does not distinguish between a focus and a node or between a strong and a weak focus or between foci (or saddles) of different orders. Such distinctions are, however, important in the production of limit cycles close to the foci (or loops) in perturbations of the systems. The notion of geometric equivalence relation of configurations of singularities allows us to incorporate all these important geometric features which can be expressed in purely algebraic terms. The geometric classification of all configurations of singularities, finite and infinite, of quadratic systems was initiated in a work published in 2013 when the classification was done for systems with total multiplicity m

f
 of finite singularities less than or equal to one. That work was continued in an article which is due to appear in 2014 where the geometric classification of configurations of singularities was done for the case m

f
 = 2. In this article we go one step further and obtain the geometric classification of singularities, finite and infinite, for the subclass mentioned above. We obtain 147 geometrically distinct configurations of singularities for this family. We give here the global bifurcation diagram of configurations of singularities, both finite and infinite, with respect to the geometric equivalence relation, for this class of systems. The bifurcation set of this diagram is algebraic. The bifurcation diagram is done in the 12-dimensional space of parameters and it is expressed in terms of polynomial invariants, a fact which gives us an algorithm for determining the geometric configuration of singularities for any quadratic system in this particular class.","Joan C.

1385,Cartesian Differential Categories as Skew Enriched Categories,"We exhibit the cartesian differential categories of Blute, Cockett and Seely as a particular kind of enriched category. The base for the enrichment is the category of commutative monoids—or in a straightforward generalisation, the category of modules over a commutative rig k. However, the tensor product on this category is not the usual one, but rather a warping of it by a certain monoidal comonad Q. Thus the enrichment base is not a monoidal category in the usual sense, but rather a skew monoidal category in the sense of Szlachányi. Our first main result is that cartesian differential categories are the same as categories with finite products enriched over this skew monoidal base. The comonad Q involved is, in fact, an example of a differential modality. Differential modalities are a kind of comonad on a symmetric monoidal k-linear category with the characteristic feature that their co-Kleisli categories are cartesian differential categories. Using our first main result, we are able to prove our second one: that every small cartesian differential category admits a full, structure-preserving embedding into the cartesian differential category induced by a differential modality (in fact, a monoidal differential modality on a monoidal closed category—thus, a model of intuitionistic differential linear logic). This resolves an important open question in this area.","Richard Garner1 & Jean-Simon Pacaud Lemay

1390,"Omnipresence, Multipresence and Ubiquity: Kinds of Generality in and Around Mathematics and Logics","A prized property of theories of all kinds is that of generality, of applicability or least relevance to a wide range of circumstances and situations. The purpose of this article is to present a pair of distinctions that suggest that three kinds of generality are to be found in mathematics and logics, not only at some particular period but especially in developments that take place over time: ‘omnipresent’ and ‘multipresent’ theories, and ‘ubiquitous’ notions that form dependent parts, or moments, of theories. The category of ‘facets’ is also introduced, primarily to assess the roles of diagrams and notations in these two disciplines. Various consequences are explored, starting with means of developing applied mathematics, and then reconsidering several established ways of elaborating or appraising theories, such as analogising, revolutions, abstraction, unification, reduction and axiomatisation. The influence of theories already in place upon theory-building is emphasised. The roles in both mathematics and logics of set theory, abstract algebras, metamathematics, and model theory are assessed, along with the different relationships between the two disciplines adopted in algebraic logic and in mathematical logic. Finally, the issue of monism versus pluralism in these two disciplines is rehearsed, and some suggestions are made about the special character of mathematical and logical knowledge, and also the differences between them.

We provide a complete proof of the Beurling-Riemann mapping theorem by combining Beurling’s geometric method with a number of new analytic tools, notably H
p-space techniques and methods from the theory of Riemann-Hilbert-Poincaré problems. One additional advantage of this approach is that it leads to an extension of the Beurling-Riemann mapping theorem for analytic maps with prescribed branching. Moreover, it allows a complete description of the boundary regularity of solutions in the (generalized) Beurling-Riemann mapping theorem extending earlier results that have been obtained by PDE techniques.

The primitive variables are represented by the Fourier series and the Chebyshev polynomials in the computational space. The time advancement is accomplished by a high-order time-splitting method, and a corresponding high-order pressure condition at the wall is introduced to reduce the splitting error. Compared with the previous pseudo-spectral scheme, in which the Navier-Stokes equations are solved in the covariant and contravariant forms, the present scheme reduces the computational cost and, at the same time, keeps the spectral accuracy. The scheme is tested in the simulations of the turbulent flow in a channel with a static streamwise wavy wall and the turbulent flow over a flexible wall undergoing the streamwise traveling wave motion. The turbulent flow over an oscillating dimple is studied with the present numerical scheme, and the periodic generation of the vortical structures is analyzed.","Ming-wei Ge

1405,A Unified Representation of Folded Surfaces via Fourier Series,"Folded surfaces find application in many technical fields, as they offer a variety of solutions to engineering design problems at different scales. An important realm of application is represented by structural design, where folded surfaces permit to achieve stiff yet lightweight shell structures. In despite of the great variety of fold patterns and their suitability as mechanical structures, the lack of a generalized geometrical representation is a limiting shortcoming for their efficient modelling and simulation. This paper bridges this gap introducing a continuous representation of folded surfaces, which is able to reduce the multiplicity of possible fold patterns to a unified mathematical description. This is achieved by using 2-dimensional Fourier series constructed on a Bravais Lattice. Within this framework, a typical design task like geometry manipulation turns out to be straightforward. At the same time, the continuous mathematical formulation applied to folded surfaces enables the direct derivation of differential geometry entities, which facilitates in turn the mechanical modelling of shell structures. In this study, we demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach by the use of two case studies. The first one achieves a consistent representation of an existing doubly-curved shell structure. In the second, we deliver an analytical solution for bending of a trapezoidal sheet.","Giovanni Della Puppa

To this extent, we first make the minimal model for the operad encoding BV-algebras explicit. Then, we prove a homotopy transfer theorem for the associated notion of homotopy BV-algebra. The final result provides an extension of the action of the homology of the Deligne–Mumford–Knudsen moduli space of genus 0 curves on the homology of some BV-algebras to an action via higher homotopical operations organized by the cohomology of the open moduli space of genus zero curves.

We also obtain all of the descriptions of their homogeneous Riemannian and Lorentzian structures and explicitly distinguish their types. Finally, we investigate parallel hypersurfaces of these spaces and show that these spaces never admit any totally geodesic hypersurface. The existence of algebraic Ricci solitons and the non-existence of left-invariant Ricci solitons and Yamabe solitons on these spaces in both Riemannian and Lorentzian cases is proved.

1411,Multiplicity-free actions and the geometry of nilpotent orbits," Let G be a reductive Lie group. Take a maximal compact subgroup K of G  and denote their Lie algebras by \( {\mathfrak g}_0 \) and \({\mathfrak k}_0 \) respectively. We get a Cartan decomposition \( {\mathfrak g}_0 ={\mathfrak k}_0 \oplus{\mathfrak s}_0 \). Let \( {\mathfrak g} \) be the complexification of \({\mathfrak g}_0 \), and \( {\mathfrak g} ={\mathfrak k} \oplus{\mathfrak s} \) the complexified decomposition. The adjoint action restricted to K  preserves the space \( {\mathfrak s}_0 \), hence \( K_{\mathbb C} \) acts on \({\mathfrak s}\), where \( K_{\mathbb }C \) denotes the complexification of K. In this paper, we consider a series of small nilpotent \( K_{\mathbb C}\)-orbits in \({\mathfrak s} \) which are obtained from the dual pair \((G, G') = (O(p, q), Sp(2 n, \R)) \) ([R. Howe, Transcending classical invariant theory. J. Amer. Math. Soc. 2 (1989), no. 3, 535–552]). We explain astonishing simple structures of these nilpotent orbits using generalized null cones. For example, these orbits have a linear ordering with respect to the closure relation, and \( K_{\mathbb C} \) acts on them in multiplicity-free manner. We clarify the \( K_{\mathbb C} \)-module structure of the regular function ring of the closure of these nilpotent orbits in detail, and prove the normality. All these results naturally comes from the analysis on the null cone \( {\mathfrak N} \) in a matrix spaceW , and the double fibration of nilpotent orbits in \( {\mathfrak s} \) and \({\mathfrak s}' \). The classical invariant theory assures that the regular functions on our nilpotent orbits are coming from harmonic polynomials on W  with repspect to \( K_{\mathfrak C} \) or \( K'_{\mathfrak C} \).

In this paper, an approach is presented to model the dynamic equations of a VGTM by independent variables, which consists of two double-octahedral truss units and a 3-revolute-prismatic-spherical (3-RPS) parallel manipulator. In this approach, the kinematic recursive relations of two adjacent bodies and geometric constrains are used to deduce the kinematic equations of the VGTM, and Jourdain’s velocity variation principle is adopted to establish the dynamic equations of the system. The validity of the proposed dynamic model is verified by comparison of numerical simulations with the software ADAMS. Besides, an active controller for trajectory tracking of the system is designed by the computed torque method. The effectiveness of the controller is numerically proved.","Xiaofeng Liu1, Qisuai Wang1, Haiquan Li1 & …Guoping Cai",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-017-2164-9,"variable geometry truss manipulator (VGTM),double-octahedral truss unit,3-revolute-prismatic-spherical (3-RPS) parallel manipulator,dynamic modeling,active control"

One consequence is that any resulting deformation space ℐ(Γ,G,H) is a Hausdorff space, where Γ acts on the threadlike homogeneous space G/H as a discontinuous subgroup. Whenever k = rank(Γ) > 3, this space is also shown to be endowed with a smooth manifold structure. But if k = 3, then ℐ(Γ,G,H) admits a smooth manifold structure as its open dense subset. These phenomena are strongly linked to the features of adjoint orbits of the basis group G on the parameter space ℛ(Γ,G,H) (which is semi-algebraic in this case) and specifically to their dimensions, as it will be seen throughout the paper. This also allows to provide a proof of the Local Rigidity Conjecture in this setup.","A. Baklouti1, F. Khlif1 & H.

1425,Application of the Method of Moments with RWG Basis Functions in Problems of Diffraction by Plates with Similar Geometries,AbstractThe problem of electromagnetic wave diffraction by metal plates with a complex geometry close to simpler domains is considered. The numerical solution of the problem is obtained by the method of moments using the algorithm for cutting out subdomains from the initial simple domain. Classical RWG functions are used as basic and test functions. The analysis of the influence of the area and position of the notch on the change in the expansion vector in terms of RWG functions is carried out. Numerical results are presented for plates with cutouts of various shapes and sizes for the case of normal incidence of a plane-polarized wave and the case of a more complex source distribution on the plate. It is shown that the difference in solutions for problems of diffraction by plates with similar geometry depends on how large currents are excited on the missing metal part. The proposed approach can be used for faster design of electrodynamic objects with complex geometry.,"D. Kh. Giniyatova1, D. N. Tumakov1 & A. G.

1426,Population persistence in river networks,"Organisms inhabiting river systems contend with downstream biased flow in a complex tree-like network. Differential equation models are often used to study population persistence, thus suggesting resolutions of the ‘drift paradox’, by considering the dependence of persistence on such variables as advection rate, dispersal characteristics, and domain size. Most previous models that explicitly considered network geometry artificially discretized river habitat into distinct patches. With the recent exception of Ramirez (J Math Biol 65:919–942, 2012), partial differential equation models have largely ignored the global geometry of river systems and the effects of tributary junctions by using intervals to describe the spatial domain. Taking advantage of recent developments in the analysis of eigenvalue problems on quantum graphs, we use a reaction–diffusion–advection equation on a metric tree graph to analyze persistence of a single population in terms of dispersal parameters and network geometry. The metric graph represents a continuous network where edges represent actual domain rather than connections among patches. Here, network geometry usually has a significant impact on persistence, and occasionally leads to dramatically altered predictions. This work ranges over such themes as model definition, reduction to a diffusion equation with the associated model features, numerical and analytical studies in radially symmetric geometries, and theoretical results for general domains. Notable in the model assumptions is that the zero-flux interior junction conditions are not restricted to conservation of hydrological discharge.","Jonathan Sarhad1, Robert Carlson2 & Kurt E.

1428,The Heat Asymptotics on Filtered Manifolds,"The short-time heat kernel expansion of elliptic operators provides a link between local and global features of classical geometries. For many geometric structures related to (non-)involutive distributions, the natural differential operators tend to be Rockland, hence hypoelliptic. In this paper, we establish a universal heat kernel expansion for formally self-adjoint non-negative Rockland differential operators on general closed filtered manifolds. The main ingredient is the analysis of parametrices in a recently constructed calculus adapted to these geometric structures. The heat expansion implies that the new calculus, a more general version of the Heisenberg calculus, also has a non-commutative residue. Many of the well-known implications of the heat expansion such as, the structure of the complex powers, the heat trace asymptotics, the continuation of the zeta function, as well as Weyl’s law for the eigenvalue asymptotics, can be adapted to this calculus. Other consequences include a McKean–Singer type formula for the index of Rockland differential operators. We illustrate some of these results by providing a more explicit description of Weyl’s law for Rumin–Seshadri operators associated with curved BGG sequences over 5-manifolds equipped with a rank-two distribution of Cartan type.","Shantanu Dave1 nAff2 & Stefan Haller

He associated to a contact projective structure a canonical projective structure on the same manifold. We interpret Fox’s construction in terms of the equivalent parabolic (Cartan) geometries, showing that it is an analog of Fefferman’s construction of a conformal structure associated to a CR structure. We show that, on the level of Cartan connections, this Fefferman-type construction is compatible with normality if and only if the initial structure has vanishing contact torsion. This leads to a geometric description of the paths that have to be added to the contact geodesics of a contact projective structure in order to obtain the subordinate projective structure. They are exactly the chains associated to the contact projective structure, which are analogs of the Chern–Moser chains in CR geometry. Finally, we analyze the consequences for the geometry of chains and prove that a chain–preserving contactomorphism must be a morphism of contact projective structures.","Andreas Čap1,2 & Vojtěch Žádník",Geometriae Dedicata,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10711-009-9426-6,"Projective structure,Contact projective structure,Path geometry,Fefferman construction,Chains,Cartan connection,Parabolic geometry"

The result of this computation has applications to the study of the conformal Fefferman space of a qc manifold, cf. (Geom Appl 28(4):376–394, 2010). In addition to this application, we are also able to easily compute a tensorial formula for the qc analog of the Weyl curvature tensor in conformal geometry and the Chern–Moser tensor in CR geometry. This tensor was first discovered via different methods by Ivanov and Vasillev (J Math Pures Appl 93:277–307, 2010), and we also get an independent proof of their Local Sphere Theorem. However, as a result of our derivation of this tensor, its fundamental properties—conformal covariance, and that its vanishing is a sharp obstruction to local flatness of the qc structure—follow as easy corollaries from the general parabolic theory.",Jesse Alt,Annals of Global Analysis and Geometry,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10455-010-9228-y,"Quaternionic contact structures,Weyl structures,Parabolic geometry,Equivalence problem"

1436,The geometry of billiards in ellipses and their poncelet grids,"The goal of this paper is an analysis of the geometry of billiards in ellipses, based on properties of confocal central conics. The extended sides of the billiards meet at points which are located on confocal ellipses and hyperbolas. They define the associated Poncelet grid. If a billiard is periodic then it closes for any choice of the initial vertex on the ellipse. This gives rise to a continuous variation of billiards which is called billiard motion though it is neither a Euclidean nor a projective motion. The extension of this motion to the associated Poncelet grid leads to new insights and invariants.",Hellmuth Stachel,Journal of Geometry,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00022-021-00606-2,"Billiard in ellipse,Caustic,Poncelet grid,Confocal conics,Billiard motion,Canonical parametrization"

We discuss the asymptotic spectrum: the existence and nonexistence of eigenvalues in the half plane \(\big \{\lambda \in {\mathbb {C}}\, :\, \text {Re}\lambda >-\lambda ^{*} \big \}\) where \(-\lambda ^{*}\) stands for the spectral bound of the streaming operator. In particular, the strict monotonicity of a leading eigenvalue (when it exists) of the transport operator with respect to different parameters of the equation is also discussed.",Khalid Latrach1 & Najeh Salhi,ANNALI DELL'UNIVERSITA' DI FERRARA,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11565-019-00331-4,"Transport operator,Delayed neutrons,General boundary condition,Asymptotic spectrum,Leading eigenvalue"

1439,Shifted Poisson geometry and meromorphic matrix algebras over an elliptic curve,"In this paper we classify symplectic leaves of the regular part of the projectivization of the space of meromorphic endomorphisms of a stable vector bundle on an elliptic curve, using the study of shifted Poisson structures on the moduli of complexes from our previous work (Hua and Polishchuk in Adv Math 338:991–1037, 2018). This Poisson ind-scheme is closely related to the ind Poisson–Lie group associated to Belavin’s elliptic r-matrix, studied by Sklyanin, Cherednik and Reyman and Semenov-Tian-Shansky. Our result leads to a classification of symplectic leaves on the regular part of meromorphic matrix algebras over an elliptic curve, which can be viewed as the Lie algebra of the above-mentioned ind Poisson–Lie group. We also describe the decomposition of the product of leaves under the multiplication morphism and show the invariance of Poisson structures under autoequivalences of the derived category of coherent sheaves on an elliptic curve.

We show that this notion appears naturally when studying the problem of pushing forward a Dirac structure along a surjective submersion, and we prove a Dirac-theoretic version of Libermann’s theorem from Poisson geometry. Our main result is an explicit construction of self-dual pairs for Dirac structures. This theorem not only recovers the global construction of symplectic realizations from Crainic and Mărcuţ (J Symplectic Geom 9(4):435–444, 2011), but allows for a more conceptual understanding of it, yielding a simpler and more natural proof. As an application of the main theorem, we present a different approach to the recent normal form theorem around Dirac transversals from Bursztyn et al. (J für die reine und angewandte Mathematik (Crelles J), doi:10.1515/crelle-2017-0014, 2017).",Pedro Frejlich1 & Ioan Mărcuț,Mathematische Zeitschrift,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00209-017-1947-3,"Dirac structure,Poisson geometry,Symplectic realization,Dual pairs,Symplectic reduction,Lie groupoids,Normal forms"

With \(F_{N,\beta }\) denoting the free energy, we compute the (logarithmic) second order term of \( NF _{N,\beta }\) and prove that, for an appropriate centering \(c_{N,\beta },\, NF _{N,\beta }-c_{N,\beta }\) is a tight sequence. We further establish the absence of temperature chaos. Those results follow from the following geometric picture we prove for the Gibbs measure, of interest by itself: asymptotically, the measure splits into infinitesimal spherical ‘bands’ centered at deep minima, playing the role of ‘pure states’. For the pure models, the latter makes precise the picture of ‘many valleys separated by high mountains’ and significant parts of the TAP analysis from the physics literature.",Eliran Subag,Inventiones mathematicae,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-017-0726-4,"Primary 60G15,60G60,82D30,Secondary 60B20"

1445,Toroidal Geometry Stabilizing a Latitudinal Ring of Point Vortices on a Torus,"We carry out the linear stability analysis of a polygonal ring configuration of N point vortices, called an N-ring, along the line of latitude \(\theta _0\) on a torus with the aspect ratio \(\alpha \). Deriving a criterion for the stability depending on the parameters N, \(\theta _0\) and \(\alpha \), we reveal how the aspect ratio \(\alpha \) contributes to the stability of the N-ring. While the N-ring necessarily becomes unstable when N is sufficiently large for fixed \(\alpha \), the stability is closely associated with the geometric property of the torus for variable \(\alpha \); for low aspect ratio \(\alpha \sim 1\), \(N=7\) is a critical number determining the stability of the N-ring when it is located along a certain range of latitudes, which is an analogous result to those in a plane and on a sphere. On the other hand, the stability is determined by the sign of curvature for high aspect ratio \(\alpha \gg 1\). That is to say, the N-ring is neutrally stable if it is located on the inner side of the toroidal surface with a negative curvature, while the N-ring on its outer side with a positive curvature is unstable. Furthermore, based on the linear stability analysis, we describe nonlinear evolution of the N-ring when it becomes unstable. It is difficult to deal with this problem, since the evolution equation of the N point vortices is formulated as a Hamiltonian system with N degrees of freedom, which is in general non-integrable. Thus, we reduce the Hamiltonian system to a simple integrable system by introducing a cyclic symmetry. Owing to this reduction, we successfully find some periodic orbits in the reduced system, whose local bifurcations and global transitions for variable \(\alpha \) are characterized in terms of the fundamental group of the torus.","Takashi Sakajo

Particular topics include the role of contractive functions on the existence of an attractor (of an IFS), chaos game orbits for approximating an attractor, a phase transition to an attractor depending on the joint spectral radius, the classification of attractors according to fibres and according to overlap, the kneading invariant of an attractor, the Mandelbrot set of a family of IFSs, fractal transformations between pairs of attractors, tilings by copies of an attractor, a generalization of analytic continuation to fractal functions, and attractor–repeller pairs and the Conley “landscape picture” for an IFS.",Michael Barnsley1 & Andrew Vince,Bulletin of Mathematical Sciences,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13373-013-0041-3,"Fractal,Iterated function system"

1449,Towards Massively Parallel Computations in Algebraic Geometry,"Introducing parallelism and exploring its use is still a fundamental challenge for the computer algebra community. In high-performance numerical simulation, on the other hand, transparent environments for distributed computing which follow the principle of separating coordination and computation have been a success story for many years. In this paper, we explore the potential of using this principle in the context of computer algebra. More precisely, we combine two well-established systems: The mathematics we are interested in is implemented in the computer algebra system Singular, whose focus is on polynomial computations, while the coordination is left to the workflow management system GPI-Space, which relies on Petri nets as its mathematical modeling language and has been successfully used for coordinating the parallel execution (autoparallelization) of academic codes as well as for commercial software in application areas such as seismic data processing. The result of our efforts is a major step towards a framework for massively parallel computations in the application areas of Singular, specifically in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. As a first test case for this framework, we have modeled and implemented a hybrid smoothness test for algebraic varieties which combines ideas from Hironaka’s celebrated desingularization proof with the classical Jacobian criterion. Applying our implementation to two examples originating from current research in algebraic geometry, one of which cannot be handled by other means, we illustrate the behavior of the smoothness test within our framework and investigate how the computations scale up to 256 cores.","Janko Böhm1, Wolfram Decker1, Anne Frühbis-Krüger2,4, Franz-Josef Pfreundt3, Mirko Rahn3 & …Lukas Ristau1,",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-020-09464-x,"Computer algebra,Singular,Distributed computing,GPI-Space,Petri nets,Computational algebraic geometry,Hironaka desingularization,Smoothness test,Surfaces of general type"
1450,Geometry of Log-Concave Density Estimation,"Shape-constrained density estimation is an important topic in mathematical statistics. We focus on densities on \(\mathbb {R}^d\) that are log-concave, and we study geometric properties of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for weighted samples. Cule, Samworth, and Stewart showed that the logarithm of the optimal log-concave density is piecewise linear and supported on a regular subdivision of the samples. This defines a map from the space of weights to the set of regular subdivisions of the samples, i.e. the face poset of their secondary polytope. We prove that this map is surjective. In fact, every regular subdivision arises in the MLE for some set of weights with positive probability, but coarser subdivisions appear to be more likely to arise than finer ones. To quantify these results, we introduce a continuous version of the secondary polytope, whose dual we name the Samworth body. This article establishes a new link between geometric combinatorics and nonparametric statistics, and it suggests numerous open problems.","Elina Robeva

First, we prove that there are no proper CRS bi-warped products other than contact CR-biwarped products in any Sasakian manifold. Then, we prove that if M is a CRS bi-warped product in a cosymplectic manifold, its second fundamental form h satisfies $$\begin{aligned} \Vert h\Vert ^2\ge 2n_1\Vert \nabla (\ln f_1)\Vert ^2+2n_2(1+2\cot ^2\theta )\Vert \nabla (\ln f_2)\Vert ^2. \end{aligned}$$Several applications of this inequality are given.

1453,Equations of Pseudo-Spherical Type (After S.S. Chern and K.

It is shown how conservation laws, pseudo-potentials, and linear problems arise naturally from geometric considerations, and it is also explained how Darboux and Bäcklund transformations can be constructed starting from geometric data. Classification results for equations in this class are stated, and hierarchies of equations of pseudo-spherical type are introduced, providing a connection between differential geometry and the study of hierarchies of equations which are the integrability condition of sl(2, R)-valued linear problems. Furthermore, the existence of correspondences between any two solutions to equations of pseudo-spherical type is reviewed, and a correspondence theorem for hierarchies is also mentioned. As applications, an elementary immersion result for pseudo-spherical metrics arising from the Chern–Tenenblat construction is proven, and non-local symmetries of the Kaup–Kupershmidt, Sawada–Kotera, fifth order Korteweg–de Vries and Camassa–Holm (CH) equation with non-zero critical wave speed are considered. It is shown that the existence of a non-local symmetry of a particular type is enough to single the first three equations out from a whole family of equations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces while, in the CH case, it is shown that it admits an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of non-local symmetries which includes the Virasoro algebra.",Enrique G.

A fiber at point x of M contains a pair of scaled complex number and vector space structures, \(\bar{C}^{c}_{x}\times \bar{V}^{c}_{x},\) for each c in GL(1, C). A space time dependent scalar field, g, determines, for each x, the scaling value of the vector space structure that contains the value, \(\psi (x)\), of a vector field at x. Vertical components of connections between neighboring fibers are taken to be the gradient field, \(\mathbf {A}(x)+i\mathbf {B}(x),\) of g. Abelian gauge theory for these fields gives the result that \(\mathbf {B}\) is massless, and no mass restrictions for \(\mathbf {A}\). Addition of an electromagnetic field does not change these results. In the Mexican hat Higgs mechanism \(\mathbf {B}\) combines with a Goldstone boson to create massive vector bosons, the photon field, and the Higgs field. For geometric quantities the fiber bundle is a tangent bundle with pairs, \(\bar{R}^{r}_{x}\times \bar{T}^{r}_{x}\) for each x and nonnegative real r. \(\mathbf {B}\) is zero everywhere. The \(\mathbf {A}\) field affects path lengths and the proper times of clocks along paths. It also appears in the geodesic equation. The lack of physical evidence for the gradient g field means that either it couples very weakly to matter fields, or that it is close to zero for all x in a local region of cosmological space and time. It says nothing about the values outside the local region.",Paul Benioff,Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40509-015-0049-3,"Number scaling,Fiber bundles,Gauge theory,Geometry"

First, there is the usual supremum norm of uniform convergence on the closed unit ball. As every orthogonally additive n-homogeneous polynomial is regular with respect to the Banach lattice structure, there is also the regular norm.  These norms are equivalent, but have significantly different geometric properties. We characterise the extreme points of the unit ball for both norms, with different results for even and odd degrees. As an application, we prove a Banach–Stone theorem. We conclude with a classification of the exposed points.","Christopher Boyd1, Raymond A.

In this paper we consider a randomizing model for STSs and generalizations to branched covers of other simple translation surfaces which we call polygon-tiled surfaces. We obtain a local central limit theorem for the genus and subsequently obtain that the distribution of the genus is asymptotically normal. We also study holonomy vectors (Euclidean displacement vectors between cone points) on a random STS. We show that asymptotically almost surely the set of holonomy vectors of a random STS contains the set of primitive vectors of \({\mathbb {Z}}^2\) and with probability approaching 1/e, these sets are equal.","Sunrose Shrestha

In the proposed scheme, the number of basis functions in the usual RBFs method reduces by the POD technique. Therefore, the computational cost of the RBF-POD method decreases in comparison with usual RBFs method, while the accuracy completely maintains. In the sequel, we provide a complete error analysis in the \(L_{2}\) norm between the exact solution and the RBFs solution, as well as between the exact solution and the proposed RBF-POD model by using the properties of the native space and projection operators. Also, the obtained error estimation is used to choose the number of POD bases for constructing the RBF-POD model with the required accuracy. Numerical examples are given to confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme.",Rezvan Ghaffari1 & Farideh Ghoreishi,Acta Applicandae Mathematicae,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10440-019-00278-w,"Radial basis function (RBF),Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD),Fractional differential equations,Reduced order model"

1472,A more robust multiparameter conformal mapping method for geometry generation of any arbitrary ship section,"The central problem of strip theory is the calculation of potential flow around 2D sections. One particular method of solutions to this problem is conformal mapping of the body section to the unit circle over which a solution of potential flow is available. Here, a new multiparameter conformal mapping method is presented that can map any arbitrary section onto a unit circle with good accuracy. The procedure for finding the corresponding mapping coefficients is iterative. The suggested mapping technique is shown to be capable of appropriately mapping any chined, bulbous, and large and fine sections. Several examples of mapping symmetric and nonsymmetric sections are demonstrated. For symmetric and nonsymmetric sections, the results of the current method are compared against other mapping techniques, and the currently produced geometries display good agreement with the actual geometries.","Mohammad Salehi1, Parviz Ghadimi1 & Ali Bakhshandeh Rostami",Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-014-9711-8,"Arbitrary ship sections,Geometry generation,Multiparameter mapping, Potential flow,Strip theory"
1473,Nearly Sasakian geometry and \(SU(2)\)-structures,"We carry on a systematic study of nearly Sasakian manifolds. We prove that any nearly Sasakian manifold admits two types of integrable distributions with totally geodesic leaves which are, respectively, Sasakian and 5-dimensional nearly Sasakian manifolds. As a consequence, any nearly Sasakian manifold is a contact manifold. Focusing on the 5-dimensional case, we prove that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between nearly Sasakian structures and a special class of nearly hypo \(SU(2)\)-structures. By deforming such an \(SU(2)\)-structure, one obtains in fact a Sasaki–Einstein structure. Further we prove that both nearly Sasakian and Sasaki–Einstein 5-manifolds are endowed with supplementary nearly cosymplectic structures. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between nearly cosymplectic structures and a special class of hypo \(SU(2)\)-structures which is again strictly related to Sasaki–Einstein structures. Furthermore, we study the orientable hypersurfaces of a nearly Kähler 6-manifold, and in the last part of the paper, we define canonical connections for nearly Sasakian manifolds, which play a role similar to the Gray connection in the context of nearly Kähler geometry. In dimension 5, we determine a connection which parallelizes all the nearly Sasakian \(SU(2)\)-structure as well as the torsion tensor field. An analogous result holds also for Sasaki–Einstein structures.",Beniamino Cappelletti-Montano1 & Giulia Dileo,Annali di Matematica Pura ed Applicata (1923 -),2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10231-015-0496-9,"Nearly Sasakian,Sasaki–Einstein,

1474,"The foundational aspects of Gauss’s work on the hypergeometric, factorial and digamma functions","In his writings about hypergeometric functions Gauss succeeded in moving beyond the restricted domain of eighteenth-century functions by changing several basic notions of analysis. He rejected formal methodology and the traditional notions of functions, complex numbers, infinite numbers, integration, and the sum of a series. Indeed, he thought that analysis derived from a few, intuitively given notions by means of other well-defined concepts which were reducible to intuitive ones. Gauss considered functions to be relations between continuous variable quantities while he regarded integration and summation as appropriate operations with limits. He also regarded infinite and infinitesimal numbers as a façon de parler and used inequalities in order to prove the existence of certain limits. He took complex numbers to have the same legitimacy as real quantities. However, Gauss’s continuum was linked to a revised form of the eighteenth-century notion of continuous quantity: it was not reducible to a set of numbers but was immediately given.",Giovanni Ferraro,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-007-0004-8,"Elementary Function,Eighteenth Century,Hypergeometric Function,Factorial Function,Hypergeometric Series"
1475,Tensor Networks and Hierarchical Tensors for the Solution of High-Dimensional Partial Differential Equations,"Hierarchical tensors can be regarded as a generalisation, preserving many crucial features, of the singular value decomposition to higher-order tensors. For a given tensor product space, a recursive decomposition of the set of coordinates into a dimension tree gives a hierarchy of nested subspaces and corresponding nested bases. The dimensions of these subspaces yield a notion of multilinear rank. This rank tuple, as well as quasi-optimal low-rank approximations by rank truncation, can be obtained by a hierarchical singular value decomposition. For fixed multilinear ranks, the storage and operation complexity of these hierarchical representations scale only linearly in the order of the tensor. As in the matrix case, the set of hierarchical tensors of a given multilinear rank is not a convex set, but forms an open smooth manifold. A number of techniques for the computation of hierarchical low-rank approximations have been developed, including local optimisation techniques on Riemannian manifolds as well as truncated iteration methods, which can be applied for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations. This article gives a survey of these developments. We also discuss applications to problems in uncertainty quantification, to the solution of the electronic Schrödinger equation in the strongly correlated regime, and to the computation of metastable states in molecular dynamics.","Markus Bachmayr1, Reinhold Schneider2 & André Uschmajew",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-016-9317-9,"Hierarchical tensors,Low-rank approximation,High-dimensional partial differential equations"

1480,Historical development of Teichmüller theory,"Originally, the expression “Teichmüller theory” referred to the theory that Oswald Teichmüller developed on deformations and on moduli spaces of marked Riemann surfaces. This theory is not an isolated field in mathematics. At different stages of its development, it received strong impetuses from analysis, geometry, and algebraic topology, and it had a major impact on other fields, including low-dimensional topology, algebraic topology, hyperbolic geometry, geometric group theory, representations of discrete groups in Lie groups, symplectic geometry, topological quantum field theory, theoretical physics, and there are certainly others. Of course, the impacts on these various fields are not equally important, but in some cases (namely, low-dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, and physics) the impact was crucial. At the same time, Teichmüller theory established important connections between the fields mentioned. This, in part, is a consequence of the diversity and the richness of the structure that Teichmüller space itself carries. From a more subjective point of view, the result of pondering on these connections and applications demonstrates the unity of mathematics. The aim of this paper is to survey the origin of Teichmüller theory and the development of its early major ideas.",Lizhen Ji1 & Athanase Papadopoulos,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-012-0104-y,"Modulus Space,Riemann Surface,Complex Manifold,Quasiconformal Mapping,Quadratic Differential"

Not only our analysis allows us to reproduce his major results but in addition, it provides opportunities for considerably extending the catalog of the known/obtained knot types.

This paper provides a probabilistic proof which accomodates more general combinatorics by analysing the dynamics of invididual circle packings. One can use reversible Markov processes to model the movement of curvature and hyperbolic area among the circles of a packing as it undergoes adjustement, much as one can use them to model the movement of current in an electrical circuit.

This generalizes previous results in this direction where the energy was also assumed to be Lipschitz. We then apply such result to the Korevaar–Schoen energy functional on the space of \(L^2\) and CAT(0) valued maps: we define the Laplacian of such \(L^2\) map as the element of minimal norm in \(-\partial ^-\textsf {E} (u)\), provided it is not empty.

1490,Random Triangle Theory with Geometry and Applications,"What is the probability that a random triangle is acute? We explore this old question from a modern viewpoint, taking into account linear algebra, shape theory, numerical analysis, random matrix theory, the Hopf fibration, and much more. One of the best distributions of random triangles takes all six vertex coordinates as independent standard Gaussians. Six can be reduced to four by translation of the center to \((0,0)\) or reformulation as a \(2\times 2\) random matrix problem. In this note, we develop shape theory in its historical context for a wide audience. We hope to encourage others to look again (and differently) at triangles. We provide a new constructive proof, using the geometry of parallelians, of a central result of shape theory: triangle shapes naturally fall on a hemisphere. We give several proofs of the key random result: that triangles are uniformly distributed when the normal distribution is transferred to the hemisphere. A new proof connects to the distribution of random condition numbers. Generalizing to higher dimensions, we obtain the “square root ellipticity statistic” of random matrix theory. Another proof connects the Hopf map to the SVD of \(2\times 2\) matrices. A new theorem describes three similar triangles hidden in the hemisphere. Many triangle properties are reformulated as matrix theorems, providing insight into both. This paper argues for a shift of viewpoint to the modern approaches of random matrix theory. As one example, we propose that the smallest singular value is an effective test for uniformity. New software is developed, and applications are proposed.",Alan Edelman1 & Gilbert Strang,Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-015-9250-3,"Random triangle,Triangle space,Shape theory,Hopf fibration,Random matrix,Lewis Carroll"
1491,Geometry-driven Collapses for Converting a Čech Complex into a Triangulation of a Nicely Triangulable Shape,"Given a set of points that sample a shape, the Rips complex of the points is often used to provide an approximation of the shape easily-computed. It has been proved that the Rips complex captures the homotopy type of the shape, assuming that the vertices of the complex meet some mild sampling conditions. Unfortunately, the Rips complex is generally high-dimensional. To remedy this problem, it is tempting to simplify it through a sequence of collapses. Ideally, we would like to end up with a triangulation of the shape. Experiments suggest that, as we simplify the complex by iteratively collapsing faces, it should indeed be possible to avoid entering a dead end such as the famous Bing’s house with two rooms. This paper provides a theoretical justification for this empirical observation. We demonstrate that the Rips complex of a point cloud (for a well-chosen scale parameter) can always be turned into a simplicial complex homeomorphic to the shape by a sequence of collapses, assuming that the shape is nicely triangulable and well-sampled (two concepts we will explain in the paper). To establish our result, we rely on a recent work which gives conditions under which the Rips complex can be converted into a Čech complex by a sequence of collapses. We proceed in two phases. Starting from the Čech complex, we first produce a sequence of collapses that arrives to the Čech complex, restricted by the shape. We then apply a sequence of collapses that transforms the result into the nerve of some covering of the shape. Along the way, we establish results which are of independent interest. First, we show that the reach of a shape cannot decrease when intersected with a (possibly infinite) collection of balls, assuming the balls are small enough. Under the same hypotheses, we show that the restriction of a shape with respect to an intersection of balls is either empty or contractible. We also provide conditions under which the nerve of a family of compact sets undergoes collapses as the compact sets evolve over time.

The main goal of the present paper is to provide a short overview of some results and open problems on smooth parametrization and its applications in several apparently rather separated domains: smooth dynamics, diophantine geometry, approximation theory, and computational geometry. The structure of the results, open problems, and conjectures in each of these domains shows in many cases a remarkable similarity, which we try to stress. Sometimes this similarity can be easily explained, sometimes the reasons remain somewhat obscure, and it motivates some natural questions discussed in the paper. We present also some new results, stressing interconnection between various types and various applications of smooth parametrization.",Y.

We show that (1) the correspondence can be precisely stated in a framework of first-order logic, (2) the correspondence, which was established by Thomsen and Bachmann for Euclidean and for plane absolute geometry, holds also for Hjelmslev geometries, Cayley–Klein geometries, isotropic and equiform geometries, and (3) these geometries and the theory of their group of motions are not only mutually interpretable but also bi-interpretable. Hence a reflection-geometric axiomatization of a class of motion groups corresponds to an elementary axiomatization of the underlying geometry and provides with the calculus of reflections a powerful proof method. In the first part of the paper we introduce the fundamental logical and geometric notions and show that the Thomsen–Bachmann correspondence can be rephrased in first-order logic by ‘The theory of the group of motions is a conservative extension of the underlying geometric theory’.","Rolf Struve

1497,From Problems to Structures: the Cousin Problems and the Emergence of the Sheaf Concept,"Historical work on the emergence of sheaf theory has mainly concentrated on the topological origins of sheaf cohomology in the period from 1945 to 1950 and on subsequent developments. However, a shift of emphasis both in time-scale and disciplinary context can help gain new insight into the emergence of the sheaf concept. This paper concentrates on Henri Cartan’s work in the theory of analytic functions of several complex variables and the strikingly different roles it played at two stages of the emergence of sheaf theory: the definition of a new structure and formulation of a new research programme in 1940–1944; the unexpected integration into sheaf cohomology in 1951–1952. In order to bring this two-stage structural transition into perspective, we will concentrate more specifically on a family of problems, the so-called Cousin problems, from Poincaré (1883) to Cartan. This medium-term narrative provides insight into two more general issues in the history of contemporary mathematics. First, we will focus on the use of problems in theory-making. Second, the history of the design of structures in geometrically flavoured contexts—such as for the sheaf and fibre-bundle structures—which will help provide a more comprehensive view of the structuralist moment, a moment whose algebraic component has so far been the main focus for historical work.",Renaud Chorlay,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-009-0052-3,"Holomorphic Function,Meromorphic Function,Open Covering,Cohomology Theory,Stein Manifold"

This result can be interpreted as a solution to the Lund-Regge reduction problem for space-like Weingarten surfaces in Minkowski space. We apply this theory to linear fractional space-like Weingarten surfaces and obtain the natural non-linear partial differential equations describing them. We obtain a characterization of space-like surfaces, whose curvatures satisfy a linear relation, by means of their natural partial differential equations.

In the first part of the paper we explain how to introduce various cohomology complexes, including Lie superalgebra and Poisson cohomology complexes, and basic and reduced Lie conformal algebra and Poisson vertex algebra cohomology complexes, by making use of the corresponding universal Lie superalgebra or Lie conformal superalgebra. The most relevant are certain subcomplexes of the basic and reduced Poisson vertex algebra cohomology complexes, which we identify (non-canonically) with the generalized de Rham complex and the generalized variational complex. In the second part of the paper we compute the cohomology of the generalized de Rham complex, and, via a detailed study of the long exact sequence, we compute the cohomology of the generalized variational complex for any quasiconstant coefficient Hamiltonian operator with invertible leading coefficient.

A new notion of weak solutions, called moment solutions, is introduced for fully nonlinear second order PDEs. Unlike viscosity solutions, moment solutions are defined by a constructive method, called the vanishing moment method, and hence, they can be readily computed by existing numerical methods such as finite difference, finite element, spectral Galerkin, and discontinuous Galerkin methods. The main idea of the proposed vanishing moment method is to approximate a fully nonlinear second order PDE by a higher order, in particular, a quasilinear fourth order PDE. We show by various numerical experiments the viability of the proposed vanishing moment method. All our numerical experiments show the convergence of the vanishing moment method, and they also show that moment solutions coincide with viscosity solutions whenever the latter exist.",Xiaobing Feng1 & Michael Neilan,Journal of Scientific Computing,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-008-9221-9,"Fully nonlinear PDEs,Monge-Ampère type equations,Moment solutions,Vanishing moment method,Viscosity solutions,Finite element method,Mixed finite element method,Spectral and discontinuous Galerkin methods"

Over the last thirty years, many versions of Floer homology have been constructed. In symplectic and contact dynamics and geometry they have become a principal tool, with applications that go far beyond the Arnol’d conjectures: The proof of the Conley conjecture and of many instances of the Weinstein conjecture, rigidity results on Lagrangian submanifolds and on the group of symplectomorphisms, lower bounds for the topological entropy of Reeb flows and obstructions to symplectic embeddings are just some of the applications of Floer’s seminal ideas. Other Floer homologies are of topological nature. Among their applications are Property P for knots and the construction of compact topological manifolds of dimension greater than five that are not triangulable.This is by no means a comprehensive survey on the presently known Floer homologies and their applications. Such a survey would take several hundred pages. We just describe some of the most classical versions and applications, together with the results that we know or like best.

We study the action integral \(L[\mathbf{X}(t)]\), \(\mathbf{X}(t) \in SLE_{\kappa }\) (the fractal variation of length of a random curve (Kennedy in J Stat Phys 128(6):1263–1277, 2006)) together with the conformal group extension CGE of CG which invariant transforms \(SLE_{\kappa }\) and \(L[\mathbf{X}(t)]\).

Among others, we cite general relativity, extra-dimension, string and super-gravity theories as physical subjects and also the study of the spectrum of Laplace-Beltrami operators on p-forms in global analysis. Then, we give expressions for the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature of a base conformal warped product in terms of Ricci tensors and scalar curvatures of its base and fiber, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce specific identities verified by particular families of, either scalar or tensorial, nonlinear differential operators on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. The latter allow us to obtain new interesting expressions for the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature of a special base conformal warped product and it turns out that not only the expressions but also the analytical approach used are interesting from the physical, geometrical and analytical point of view. Finally, we analyze, investigate and characterize possible solutions for the conformal and warping factors of a special base conformal warped product, which guarantee that the corresponding product is Einstein.

The essential components are (i) (provably) rapidly convergent global reduced-basis approximations – Galerkin projection onto a space WN spanned by solutions of the governing partial differential equation at N selected points in parameter space; (ii) a posteriori error estimation – relaxations of the error-residual equation that provide inexpensive yet sharp bounds for the error in the outputs of interest; and (iii) off-line/on-line computational procedures – methods which decouple the generation and projection stages of the approximation process. The operation count for the on-line stage – in which, given a new parameter value, we calculate the output of interest and associated error bound – depends only on N, typically very small, and the (approximate) parametric complexity of the problem; the method is thus ideally suited for the repeated and rapid evaluations required in the context of parameter estimation, design, optimization, and real-time control.In our earlier work, we develop a rigorous a posteriori error bound framework for the case in which the parametrization of the partial differential equation is exact; in this paper, we address the situation in which our mathematical model is not “complete.” In particular, we permit error in the data that define our partial differential operator: this error may be introduced, for example, by imperfect specification, measurement, calculation, or parametric expansion of a coefficient function. We develop both accurate predictions for the outputs of interest and associated rigorous a posteriori error bounds; and the latter incorporate both numerical discretization and “model truncation” effects. Numerical results are presented for a particular instantiation in which the model error originates in the (approximately) prescribed velocity field associated with a three-dimensional convection-diffusion problem.

1523,A new hierarchically-structured n-dimensional covariant form of rotating equations of geophysical fluid dynamics,"We introduce n-dimensional equations of geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) valid on rotating n-dimensional manifolds. Moreover, by using straight and twisted differential forms and an auxiliary velocity field, we introduce hierarchically-structured equations of (geophysical) fluid dynamics in which the equations are split into metric-free and metric-dependent parts. For these sets of equations we provide representations in local coordinate charts and we show that they conserve potential vorticity and that Kelvin’s circulation theorem holds. As such general n-dimensional formulations do not exist in vector calculus, we provide for both covariant and vector-invariant equations a representation on a rotating coordinate frame in an Euclidean space and compare these representations. This study reveals, among others, that the prognostic variables, described by straight and twisted differential forms, are independent of both metric and orientation. This makes them perfect descriptors of the fluid’s quantities of interest, as they assign, analogously to physical measurement devices, real valued numbers to finite distances, areas, or volumes. This is not the case for prognostic variables described by (vector) proxy fields, as they depend on metric and orientation. The new structuring reveals also important geometrical features of the equations of GFD. For instance, the dimensioned differential forms display the geometric nature of the fluid’s characteristics, while the equations’ structuring illustrates how the metric-free momentum and continuity equations geometrically interact and how they are connected by the metric-dependent Hodge star and Riemannian lift. Besides this geometric insight, this structuring has also practical benefits: since equations containing only topological structure are less complicated to implement and can be integrated exactly, our results may contribute to more efficient and accurate discretizations.",Werner Bauer,GEM - International Journal on Geomathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13137-015-0074-8,"Rotating Euler’s equations,Covariant equations,Covariant split Euler’s equations of GFD,Geophysical fluid dynamics,Differential geometry, Exterior calculus"

His constructions implicitly used an interpretation of a monomial PDE system as a generating family of a multiplicative set of monomials. He introduced an algorithmic method on multiplicative sets to compute compatibility conditions, and to study the problem of the existence and the uniqueness of a solution to a linear PDE system with given initial conditions. The compatibility conditions are formulated using a refinement of the division operation on monomials defined with respect to a partition of the set of variables into multiplicative and non-multiplicative variables. Janet was a pioneer in the development of these algorithmic methods, and the completion procedure that he introduced on polynomials was the first one in a long and rich series of works on completion methods which appeared independently throughout the twentieth-century in various algebraic contexts.","Kenji Iohara

We show that the \({\mathbb{S}^1}\) -symmetry of the PDE leads to a normal form for the undifferentiated conservation laws. Zhiber and Shabat (in Sov Phys Dokl Akad 24(8):607–609, 1979) determine which potentials of nonlinearizable Poisson equations admit nontrivial Lie–Bäcklund transformations. In the case that such transformations exist, they introduce a pseudo-differential operator that can be used to generate infinitely many such transformations. We obtain similar results using the theory of characteristic cohomology: we show that for higher-order conservation laws to exist, it is necessary that the potential satisfies a linear second-order ODE. In this case, at most two new conservation laws in normal form appear at each even prolongation. By using a recursion motivated by Killing fields, we show that, for the simplest class of potentials, this upper bound is attained. The recursion circumvents the use of pseudo-differential operators. We relate higher-order conservation laws to generalized symmetries of the exterior differential system by identifying their generating functions.

This algorithmic system had been created at the end of the nineteenth century by the Italian mathematician Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro who, together with his most brilliant pupil, Tullio Levi-Civita, had applied it to several problems in geometry and mathematical physics. However, before the birth of the great Einsteinian theory, the new calculus was not been sufficiently appreciated by the contemporaries, as its complexity appeared to render it superfluous. It asserted itself only with the triumph of general relativity, since it proved to be indispensable to formulate the theory and had shown its power and elegance in its construction.",Fabio Toscano,Lettera Matematica,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40329-017-0163-7,"Albert Einstein,Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro,Tullio Levi-Civita,Absolute differential calculus,Tensor,General relativity"
1554,Infinitesimal deformation of p-adic differential equations on Berkovich curves,"We show that if a differential equation \(\mathscr {F}\) over a quasi-smooth Berkovich curve X has a certain compatibility condition with respect to an automorphism \(\sigma \) of X, then \(\mathscr {F}\) acquires a semi-linear action of \(\sigma \) (i.e. lifting that on X). The compatibility condition forces the automorphism \(\sigma \) to be close to the identity of X, so the above construction applies to a certain class of automorphisms called infinitesimal. This generalizes André and Di Vizio (Astérisqué 1(296):55–111, 2004) and Pulita (Compos. Math. 144(4):867–919, 2008).

1556,Random heterogeneous microstructure construction of composites via fractal geometry,"The microstructures of a composite determine its macroscopic properties. In this study, microstructures with particles of arbitrary shapes and sizes are constructed by using several developed fractal geometry algorithms implemented in MATLAB. A two-dimensional (2D) quadrilateral fractal geometry algorithm is developed based on the modified Sierpinski carpet algorithm. Square-, rectangle-, circle-, and ellipse-based microstructure constructions are special cases of the 2D quadrilateral fractal geometry algorithm. Moreover, a three-dimensional (3D) random hexahedron geometry algorithm is developed according to the Menger sponge algorithm. Cube- and sphere-based microstructure constructions are special cases of the 3D hexahedron fractal geometry algorithm. The polydispersities of fractal shapes and random fractal sub-units demonstrate significant enhancements compared to those obtained by the original algorithms. In addition, the 2D and 3D algorithms mentioned in this article can be combined according to the actual microstructures. The verification results also demonstrate the practicability of these algorithms. The developed algorithms open up new avenues for the constructions of microstructures, which can be embedded into commercial finite element method softwares.","Siwen Wang1 & Zhansheng Guo2,",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-019-2522-5,"microstructure,fractal geometry algorithm,arbitrary shape and size,arbitrary quadrilateral,arbitrary hexahedron"

The so-called “Subjectivity Geometry ” herein is a course for studying the relationship between the abstracted object configuration and its observed record by means of mathematical methods and described by mathematical language. There are many features differing from the common geometry when the effects of the subjectivity (such as the position of the observer, the functions of the visual system of human) are taken into account during the observing-recording process. In this paper, some basic assumptions are made; spherical observing record is suggested; the fundamental relationship between the abstracted object configuration and its corresponding observed record is studied and an example of application of the above theory is presented. We anticipate that the study of subjectivity geometry will influence, or will be associated with the study of physiology of the visual system, applied optics etc., and will be useful in surveying, pilotage and imitative biology, etc.

1569,Algorithms for Symmetric Differential Systems," Over-determined systems of partial differential equations may be studied using differential—elimination algorithms, as a great deal of information about the solution set of the system may be obtained from the output. Unfortunately, many systems are effectively intractable by these methods due to the expression swell incurred in the intermediate stages of the calculations. This can happen when, for example, the input system depends on many variables and is invariant under a large rotation group, so that there is no natural choice of term ordering in the elimination and reduction processes. This paper describes how systems written in terms of the differential invariants of a Lie group action may be processed in a manner analogous to differential—elimination algorithms. The algorithm described terminates and yields, in a sense which we make precise, a complete set of representative invariant integrability conditions which may be calculated in a ``critical pair'' completion procedure. Further, we discuss some of the profound differences between algebras of differential invariants and standard differential algebras. We use the new, regularized moving frame method of Fels and Olver [11], [12] to write a differential system in terms of the invariants of a symmetry group. The methods described have been implemented as a package in \MAPLE. The main example discussed is the analysis of the (2+1 )-d'Alembert—Hamilton system u_{xx}+u_{yy}- u_{zz}&=& f(u), u_x^2+u_y^2- u_z^2&=&1. (1) We demonstrate the classification of solutions due to Collins [7] for f\ne 0  using the new methods. ",Elizabeth L.

An example due to Brower shows that the Linearity Condition (GL) is weaker than the Intersection Property (IP). In this paper we point out some conditions which have to be added to (GL) in order to get (IP), and we describe some of the relations between these conditions and each of the four ‘intersection’ properties given above.

We start from the first-level mechanisms of visual perception, receptive profiles. The model interprets V1 as a fiber bundle over the two-dimensional retinal plane by introducing orientation, frequency, and phase as intrinsic variables. Each receptive profile on the fiber is mathematically interpreted as rotated, frequency modulated, and phase shifted Gabor function. We start from the Gabor function and show that it induces in a natural way the model geometry and the associated horizontal connectivity modeling of the neural connectivity patterns in V1. We provide an image enhancement algorithm employing the model framework. The algorithm is capable of exploiting not only orientation but also frequency and phase information existing intrinsically in a two-dimensional input image. We provide the experimental results corresponding to the enhancement algorithm.","E. Baspinar

1575,What is loop multiplication anyhow?,"In the beginning we are taught that multiplication of pointed loops is just the first followed by the second. Later we learn that the cobar construction on the chains of the base is a model for the chains on the loop space, that is, this cobar construction is chain equivalent to the chains on the loop space. The cobar construction is a certain tensor algebra and has a natural multiplication of tensors. This multiplication of tensors models the multiplication induced by the multiplication of loops. But, because of the simplicity of the definition of loop multiplication, this modeling is not obvious. We interpret loop multiplication so that this modeling becomes a clear consequence of the naturality of Eilenberg–Moore methods applied to multiple or iterated pullbacks. In contrast, we observe that, if we require that it be invariant under homological equivalence of differential coalgebras, there is no natural modeling of the comultiplication in the loop space. But, in rational homotopy theory, results of Milnor–Moore and Quillen show that there is a natural modeling of the Hopf algebra structure of the loop space.",Joseph A.

We discuss the applications of the SA formalism to control theory. Considerable attention is devoted to the geometry of the Andoyer variables and to the modeling of control torques. We develop a new approach to Stabilization of rigid-body dynamics, an approach wherein the state-space model is formulated through sets of canonical elements that partially or completely reduce the unperturbed Euler-Poinsot problem. The controllability of the system model is examined using the notion of accessibility, and is shown to be accessible. Based on the accessibility proof, a Hamiltonian controller is derived by using the Hamiltonian as a natural Lyapunov function for the closed-loop dynamics. It is shown that the Hamiltonian controller is both passive and inverse optimal with respect to a meaningful performance-index. Finally, we point out the possibility to apply methods of structure-preserving control using the canonical Andoyer variables, and we illustrate this approach on rigid bodies containing internal rotors.","A.

The focus is on the local resonance set, i.e., regions in parameter space for which periodic dynamics occurs. A classification of the corresponding geometry is obtained by applying Poincaré-Takens reduction, Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction and contact-equivalence singularity theory, equivariant under an appropriate cyclic group. It is a classical result that the local geometry of these sets in the nondegenerate case is given by an Arnol’d resonance tongue. In a mildly degenerate situation a more complicated geometry given by a singular perturbation of a Whitney umbrella is encountered. Our approach also provides a skeleton for the local resonant Hopf-Neĭmarck-Sacker dynamics in the form of planar Poincaré-Takens vector fields. To illustrate our methods a leading example is used: A periodically forced generalized Duffing-Van der Pol oscillator.","Henk W. Broer1, Sijbo J.

The main new feature of the algorithm is that the vertex velocities and the numerical fluxes through the cell interfaces are all evaluated in a coherent manner contrary to standard approaches. In this paper the method introduced by Maire et al. is extended for the equations of Lagrangian gas dynamics in cylindrical symmetry. Two different schemes are proposed, whose difference is that one uses volume weighting and the other area weighting in the discretization of the momentum equation. In the both schemes the conservation of total energy is ensured, and the nodal solver is adopted which has the same formulation as that in Cartesian coordinates. The volume weighting scheme preserves the momentum conservation and the area-weighting scheme preserves spherical symmetry. The numerical examples demonstrate our theoretical considerations and the robustness of the new method.","ZhiJun Shen1, GuangWei Yuan1, Yue JingYan1 & …XueZhe Liu",Science in China Series A: Mathematics,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-008-0121-0,"Lagrangian hydrodynamics,cylindrical coordinate,cell centered,area weighting"
1584,"The geometric complexity of special Lagrangian T
2-cones","We prove a number of results on the geometric complexity of special Lagrangian (SLG) T
2-cones in ℂ3. Every SLG T
2-cone has a fundamental integer invariant, its spectral curve genus. We prove that the spectral curve genus of an SLG T
2-cone gives a lower bound for its geometric complexity, i.e. the area, the stability index and the Legendrian index of any SLG T
2-cone are all bounded below by explicit linearly growing functions of the spectral curve genus. We prove that the cone on the Clifford torus (which has spectral curve genus zero) in S
5 is the unique SLG T
2-cone with the smallest possible Legendrian index and hence that it is the unique stable SLG T
2-cone. This leads to a classification of all rigid “index 1” SLG cone types in dimension three. For cones with spectral curve genus two we give refined lower bounds for the area, the Legendrian index and the stability index. One consequence of these bounds is that there exist S

We consider the strictly causal manifolds with unipotent holonomy groups and assign to a manifold of this type four nonnegative integers (a signature) and a parabola in the cone of positive definite matrices. Two manifolds are equivalent if and only if their signatures coincide and the corresponding parabolas are equal (up to a suitable automorphism of the cone and an affine change of variable). Also, we give necessary and sufficient conditions distinguishing the parabolas of this type among all parabolas in the cone.",V. M. Gichev1 & E. A.

1586,Hilbert Space of Probability Density Functions Based on Aitchison Geometry,"The set of probability functions is a convex subset of L
1 and it does not have a linear space structure when using ordinary sum and multiplication by real constants. Moreover, difficulties arise when dealing with distances between densities. The crucial point is that usual distances are not invariant under relevant transformations of densities. To overcome these limitations, Aitchison's ideas on compositional data analysis are used, generalizing perturbation and power transformation, as well as the Aitchison inner product, to operations on probability density functions with support on a finite interval. With these operations at hand, it is shown that the set of bounded probability density functions on finite intervals is a pre–Hilbert space. A Hilbert space of densities, whose logarithm is square–integrable, is obtained as the natural completion of the pre–Hilbert space.","J. J. Egozcue1, J. L. Díaz–Barrero1 & V.

1587,"Dynamical systems with variable dissipation: approaches, methods, and applications","This work is devoted to the development of qualitative methods in the theory of nonconservative systems that arise, e.g., in such fields of science as the dynamics of a rigid body interacting with a resisting medium, oscillation theory, etc. This material can arouse the interest of specialists in the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations, in rigid body dynamics, as well as in fluid and gas dynamics since the work uses the properties of motion of a rigid body in a medium under streamline flow-around conditions.The author obtains a full spectrum of complete integrability cases for nonconservative dynamical systems having nontrivial symmetries. Moreover, in almost all cases of integrability, each of the first integrals is expressed through a finite combination of elementary functions and is a transcendental function of its variables, simultaneously. In this case, the transcendence is meant in the complex analysis sense; i.e., after the continuation of the functions considered to the complex domain, they have essentially singular points. The latter fact is stipulated by the existence of attracting and repelling limit sets in the system considered (for example, attracting and repelling foci).The author obtains new families of phase portraits of systems with variable dissipation on lowerand higher-dimensional manifolds. He discusses the problems of their absolute or relative roughness, He discovers new integrable cases of rigid body motion, including those in the classical problem of motion of a spherical pendulum placed in an over-running medium flow.",M.

1588,Generalization of tropical geometry and amebas to the region of negative pressures: Comparison with van der waals gas,"In the region of negative pressures P, the addend γ corresponding to the number of degrees of freedom D = 2γ + 2 is less than zero. The energy equal to E = V P is also less than zero. Therefore, it is natural to introduce a negative relative temperature as the mean energy. The negative pressure on the negative spinodal tends to minus infinity as T

r
 → 0. Accordingly, the negative relative temperature will also approach minus infinity. As the chemical potential μ→−∞, μ/T → 0, the asymptotic behavior of the thermodynamic quantities gives rise to amebas of special form in tropical (idempotent) analysis. It is shown that the theoretical isotherms obtained in this paper coincide with the isotherms of van derWaals gas up to the third decimal place. For theoretical distributions, transitions to amorphic solids (glass) occurs.","V. P.

1589,The integral geometry boundary determination problem for a pencil of straight lines,"Under consideration is the problem of integrating finitely many functions over straight lines. Each function as well as the corresponding line is assumed unknown. The available information is the sum of integrals over all straight lines of a family of pencils in each of which the intersection of lines is a point of a given bounded open set in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. Each integrand depends on a greater number of variables than the sum of the integrals. Hence, the conventional statement of the problem of determining the integrands becomes underspecified. In this situation we pose and study the problem of determining the discontinuity surfaces of the integrands. The uniqueness theorem is proven under the condition that these surfaces exist. The present article is a refinement of the previous studies of the authors and differs from them in [1–6] by not only some technical improvements but also the principally new fact that the integration is performed over an unknown set.",D.

1590,On the geometry of polynomial dynamical systems,"In this paper, the author performs a global qualitative study of plane polynomial dynamical systems and suggests a new geometric approach to solving the sixteenth Hilbert problem on the maximum number and mutual location of their limit cycles in two special cases of such systems. First of all, using the geometric properties of four parameters rotating the vector field of a new canonical system constructed in the paper, the author proposes the proof of his early conjecture, which asserts that the maximum number of limit cycles of an arbitrary quadratic system is equal to 4, and their location (3: 1) is uniquely possible [4]. Then using the same geometric approach, the author solves the primary problem for the polynomial Liénard system (in this special case, it is considered as the thirteenth Smale problem), and generalizing the obtained results, the author formulates the theorem on the maximum number of limit cycles enclosing one singular point in the case of a polynomial system. Moreover, applying the Wintner-Perko termination principle for multiple limit cycles, the author develops an alternative approach to solving the sixteenth Hilbert problem, and using this approach, the author completes the global qualitative study of a general cubic Liénard system having three singular points in the finite part of the plane. In conclusion, the author discusses one more known approach to solving the sixteenth Hilbert problem.",V. A.

Such manifolds have recently attracted much attention due to the construction of generalized gravity models. Under the assumption that all geometric objects are real analytic functions, normal coordinates in a neighborhood of an arbitrary point are constructed by expanding the connection and the metric in Taylor series. It is shown that the normal coordinates are a generalization of a Cartesian coordinate system in Euclidean space to the case of manifolds with any affine geometry. Moreover, the components of any real analytic tensor field in a neighborhood of any given point are represented in the form of a power series whose coefficients are constructed from the covariant derivatives and the curvature and torsion tensors evaluated at this point. For constant curvature spaces, these series are explicitly summed, and an expression for the metric in normal coordinates is found. It is shown that normal coordinates determine a smooth surjective mapping of Euclidean space to a constant curvature manifold. The equations for extremals are explicitly integrated in normal coordinates for constant curvature spaces. A relationship between normal coordinates and the exponential mapping is analyzed.","M. O.

First, a wave train of this type can be formed by wind action at a considerable distance from the place of impact. The waves propagate along a coastline without significant loss of energy, provided that the coastline and shelf zone topography have no features comparable to the Rossby radius. However, the waves lose energy while passing over capes and submarine canyons and when the shelf width decreases. For regional modeling, remote generation of waves must be thoroughly investigated and taken into account. The other feature is that the propagating waves can use part of energy to form density anomalies on the shelf by raising intermediate waters from the adjacent offshore areas of the open ocean. Thus, coastal trapped waves can carry wind energy from wind action areas to other coastal areas to form density anomalies and other types of motion.",G. A.

1613,Recent Results in the Geometry of Kleinian Groups,A spherical point of a Kleinian group Γ is a point of ℍ3 that is stabilized by a spherical triangle subgroup of Γ. Such points appear as vertices in the singular graph of the quotient hyperbolic 3-orbifold. We announce here sharp lower bounds for the hyperbolic distances between such points in H3. These bound from below the edge lengths of the singular graph. An elliptic element of a Kleinian group is simple if the translates of its axis under the group Γ form a disjoint collection of hyperbolic lines. Here we announce that the minimal covolume Kleinian group contains no simple elliptics of order p ≥ 3.Applications of these estimates leads to sharp volume bounds for hyperbolic 3-orbifolds whose singular set contains a spherical point. We are also able to present substantial progress to the problem of identifying the minimal covolume Kleinian group.,"Frederick W. Gehring1, Timothy H. Marshall2 & Gaven J.

Both methods are described in detail and we highlight some strengths and weaknesses of each method via the numerical comparisons. The two equations used in the benchmark problems are the viscous Burgers’ equation and the porous medium equation, both in one dimension. Simulations are made for the two methods for: a) a travelling wave solution for the viscous Burgers’ equation, b) the Barenblatt selfsimilar analytical solution of the porous medium equation, and c) a waiting-time solution for the porous medium equation. Simulations are carried out for varying mesh sizes, and the numerical solutions are compared by computing errors in two ways. In the case of an analytic solution being available, the errors in the numerical solutions are computed directly from the analytic solution. In the case of no availability of an analytic solution, an approximation to the error is computed using a very fine mesh numerical solution as the reference solution.","Abigail Wacher1,",Central European Journal of Mathematics,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.2478/s11533-012-0161-0,"65M50,35R37"

1621,Geometry of Coadjoint Orbits and Multiplicity-one Branching Laws for Symmetric Pairs,"Consider the restriction of an irreducible unitary representation π of a Lie group G to its subgroup H. Kirillov’s revolutionary idea on the orbit method suggests that the multiplicity of an irreducible H-module ν occurring in the restriction π|H could be read from the coadjoint action of H on \(\mathcal {O}^{G} \cap \text {pr}^{-1}({\mathcal {O}}^{H})\), provided π and ν are ‘geometric quantizations’ of a G-coadjoint orbit \(\mathcal {O}^{G}\) and an H-coadjoint orbit \(\mathcal {O}^{H}\), respectively, where \(\text {pr} \colon \sqrt {-1}\mathfrak {g}^{\ast } \to \sqrt {-1}\mathfrak {h}^{\ast }\) is the projection dual to the inclusion \(\mathfrak {h} \subset \mathfrak {g}\) of Lie algebras. Such results were previously established by Kirillov, Corwin and Greenleaf for nilpotent Lie groups. In this article, we highlight specific elliptic orbits \(\mathcal {O}^{G}\) of a semisimple Lie group G corresponding to highest weight modules of scalar type. We prove that the Corwin–Greenleaf number \(\sharp (\mathcal {O}^{G} \cap \text {pr}^{-1}({\mathcal {O}}^{H}))/H\) is either zero or one for any H-coadjoint orbit \(\mathcal {O}^{H}\), whenever (G,H) is a symmetric pair of holomorphic type. Furthermore, we determine the coadjoint orbits \(\mathcal {O}^{H}\) with nonzero Corwin–Greenleaf number. Our results coincide with the prediction of the orbit philosophy, and can be seen as ‘classical limits’ of the multiplicity-free branching laws of holomorphic discrete series representations (Kobayashi [Progr. Math. 2007]).","Toshiyuki Kobayashi

1623,The Fundamental Group of a Noncommutative Space,"We introduce and analyse a general notion of fundamental group for noncommutative spaces, described by differential graded algebras. For this we consider connections on finitely generated projective bimodules over differential graded algebras and show that the category of flat connections on such modules forms a Tannakian category. As such this category can be realised as the category of representations of an affine group scheme G, which in the classical case is (the pro-algebraic completion of) the usual fundamental group. This motivates us to define G to be the fundamental group of the noncommutative space under consideration. The needed assumptions on the differential graded algebra are rather mild and completely natural in the context of noncommutative differential geometry. We establish the appropriate functorial properties, homotopy and Morita invariance of this fundamental group. As an example we find that the fundamental group of the noncommutative torus can be described as the algebraic hull of the topological group \((\mathbb Z+\theta \mathbb Z)^{2}\).","Walter D. van Suijlekom

On spacetime manifolds, we consider a nonholonomic splitting of dimensions and define a new class of liner connections which are ‘N-adapted’, metric compatible and uniquely defined by the metric structure. We prove that for such a linear connection, one yields couples of generalized sine-Gordon equations when the corresponding geometric curve flows result in solitonic hierarchies described in explicit form by nonholonomic wave map equations and mKdV analogs of the Schrödinger map equation. All geometric constructions can be re-defined for the Levi-Civita connection but with “noholonomic mixing” of solitonic interactions.

We establish an identification of the twisted symmetric m-differentials on X with the tangentially homogeneous polynomials relative to X of degree m. The lack of the hypothesis of X being a complete intersection is dealt with results on the properties of the vanishing locus of tangentially homogeneous polynomials and algebraic geometric properties of the tangent-secant variety of X.","Bruno De Oliveira

Consider a Riemannian manifold equipped with an infinitesimal isometry. For this setup, a unified treatment is provided, solely in the language of Riemannian geometry, of techniques in reduction, linearization, and stability of relative equilibria. In particular, for mechanical control systems, an explicit characterization is given for the manner in which reduction by an infinitesimal isometry, and linearization along a controlled trajectory “commute.” As part of the development, relationships are derived between the Jacobi equation of geodesic variation and concepts from reduction theory, such as the curvature of the mechanical connection and the effective potential. As an application of our techniques, fiber and base stability of relative equilibria are studied. The paper also serves as a tutorial of Riemannian geometric methods applicable in the intersection of mechanics and control theory.

That enables us to give a direct and relatively short proof of the key result [GS1, Theorem 1.4] without recourse to Haiman’s deep results on the n! theorem [Ha1].

1662,On the genesis of the Cartan–Kähler theory,"The theory of exterior differential systems plays a crucial role in Cartan’s whole mathematical production. As he once recognized, all the germs of his subsequent work were contained there. Indeed, it provided him with powerful technical tools that turned out to be very useful in many different fields such as the theory of partial differential equations, the theory of infinite dimensional Lie groups (Lie pseudogroups) and differential geometry. Nevertheless, scarce attention has been paid to this area of historical research thus far. Although authoritative scholars have investigated the foundation of exterior differential calculus in Cartan’s early papers, no specific analysis of Cartan’s subsequent works laying the foundations of what nowadays is known as the Cartan–Kähler theory has been yet provided. This article represents a first attempt to remedy this unsatisfactory state of affairs by focusing on Cartan’s work on Pfaffian systems at the very beginning of the past century. The analysis of Cartan’s relevant papers is preceded by a description of the historical context in which such contributions were conceived. In this respect, special emphasis will be put on some works by Engel and von Weber on Pfaffian systems, which laid the basis for the subsequent geometrical developments of Cartan’s theory of exterior differential systems.",Alberto Cogliati,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00407-011-0081-6,"Differential System,Linear Complex,Integral Variety,Characteristic Element,Integral Element"
1663,The early application of the calculus to the inverse square force problem,"The translation of Newton’s geometrical Propositions in the Principia into the language of the differential calculus in the form developed by Leibniz and his followers has been the subject of many scholarly articles and books. One of the most vexing problems in this translation concerns the transition from the discrete polygonal orbits and force impulses in Prop. 1 to the continuous orbits and forces in Prop. 6. Newton justified this transition by lemma 1 on prime and ultimate ratios which was a concrete formulation of a limit, but it took another century before this concept was established on a rigorous mathematical basis. This difficulty was mirrored in the newly developed calculus which dealt with differentials that vanish in this limit, and therefore were considered to be fictional quantities by some mathematicians. Despite these problems, early practitioners of the differential calculus like Jacob Hermann, Pierre Varignon, and Johann Bernoulli succeeded without apparent difficulties in applying the differential calculus to the solution of the fundamental problem of orbital motion under the action of inverse square central forces. By following their calculations and describing some essential details that have been ignored in the past, I clarify the reason why the lack of rigor in establishing the continuum limit was not a practical problem.",M.

Although symbolic manipulation of such indexed functions is one of the oldest research topics in computer algebra, so far there exists no normal form reduction algorithm to judge whether two indexed polynomials involving indices of different coordinate systems are equal or not. It is a challenging task in computer algebra.In this paper, for a typical framework—the partial derivatives in coordinate transformation matrix involved are of order no more than two (such as local computations of ordinary curvatures and torsion), we put forward two algorithms, one on elimination of all redundant dummy indices of indexed polynomials, the other on normalization of such indexed polynomials, by which we can judge whether two indexed polynomials are equal or not.We implement the algorithms with Maple V.10 and use them to solve tensor verification problems in differential geometry, and to derive automatically the transformation rules of locally defined indexed functions under the change of local coordinates.","Jiang Liu1,2, HongBo Li1 & YuanHao Cao",Science in China Series A: Mathematics,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-009-0005-y,"

This is an interesting family because on one side it is defined by an algebraic geometric property and on the other, it is a family where limit cycles occur. Note that each quadratic differential system can be identified with a point of \({{\mathbb {R}}}^{12}\) through its coefficients. In this paper we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a system in QS to have at least one invariant ellipse. We give the global “bifurcation” diagram of the family QS which indicates where an ellipse is present or absent and in case it is present, the diagram indicates if the ellipse is or it is not a limit cycle. The diagram is expressed in terms of affine invariant polynomials and it is done in the 12-dimensional space of parameters.

1676,Normalization of Indexed Differentials by Extending Gröbner Basis Theory,"It is a fundamental problem to determine the equivalence of indexed differential polynomials in both computer algebra and differential geometry. However, in the literature, there are no general computational theories for this problem. The main reasons are that the ideal generated by the basic syzygies cannot be finitely generated, and it involves eliminations of dummy indices and functions. This paper solves the problem by extending Gröbner basis theory. The authors first present a division of the set of elementary indexed differential monomials \(E_{\partial\kern-0.35em\raise0.22ex\hbox{/}}\) into disjoint subsets, by defining an equivalence relation on \(E_{\partial\kern-0.35em\raise0.22ex\hbox{/}}\) based on Leibniz expansions of monomials. The equivalence relation on \(E_{\partial\kern-0.35em\raise0.22ex\hbox{/}}\) also induces a division of a Gröbner basis of basic syzygies into disjoint subsets.

1677,The index of differential forms on complete intersections,"The article is devoted to the development of a homological approach to the problem of calculating the local topological index of holomorphic differential 1-forms given on complex space. In the study of complete intersections our method is based on the construction of Lebelt and Cousin resolutions, as well as on the simplest properties of the generalized and usual Koszul complexes, regular meromorphic differential forms, and the residue map. In particular, we show that the index of a differential 1-form with an isolated singularity is equal to the dimension of the local analytical algebra of a zero-dimensional germ which is determined by the ideal generated by the interior product of the form and all Hamiltonian vector fields of the complete intersection. Moreover, in the quasihomogeneous case, the index can be expressed explicitly in terms of values of classical symmetric functions. We also discuss some other methods for computing the homological index of 1-forms given on analytic spaces with singularities of various types.",A. G.

This theory can be used to unify a range of different topics, such as polar-type matrix decompositions, splitting methods for computation of the matrix exponential, composition of selfadjoint numerical integrators and dynamical systems with symmetries and reversing symmetries. The thread of this paper is the following: involutive automorphisms on groups induce a factorization at a group level, and a splitting at the algebra level. In this paper we will give an introduction to the mathematical theory behind these constructions, and review recent results. Furthermore, we present a new Yoshida-like technique, for self-adjoint numerical schemes, that allows to increase the order of preservation of symmetries by two units. The proposed techniques has the property that all the time-steps are positive.","H. Z. Munthe-Kaas1, G. R. W. Quispel2 & A.

Guided by the so-called sharp topology and the interpretation of Colombeau generalized functions as point functions on generalized point sets, we introduce the notion of membranes and extend the definition of integrals, given in Aragona et al. (Monatsh. Math. 144:13–29, 2005), to integrals defined on membranes. We use this to prove a generalized version of the Cauchy formula and to obtain the Goursat Theorem for generalized holomorphic functions. A number of results from classical differential and integral calculus, like the inverse and implicit function theorems and Green’s theorem, are transferred to the generalized setting. Further, we indicate that solution formulas for transport and wave equations with generalized initial data can be obtained as well.","Jorge Aragona1, Roseli Fernandez1, Stanley O.

n induces a natural partial ordering on the manifold \(\mathcal{H}_{n}\) of monic hyperbolic polynomials of degree n. We show that all differential operators of Laguerre–Pólya type preserve the spectral order. We also establish a global monotony property for infinite families of deformations of these operators parametrized by the space ℓ∞ of real bounded sequences. As a consequence, we deduce that the monoid \(\mathcal{A}^{\prime}\) of linear operators that preserve averages of zero sets and hyperbolicity consists only of differential operators of Laguerre–Pólya type which are both extensive and isotonic. In particular, these results imply that any hyperbolic polynomial is the global minimum of its \(\mathcal{A}^{\prime}\)-orbit and that Appell polynomials are characterized by a global minimum property with respect to the spectral order.

In classical mass-action kinetics, a mechanism implies a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which govern the time evolution of the concentrations. In this article, ODE models of chemical kinetics that have the potential for multiple positive equilibria or oscillations are studied. We begin by considering some methods of stability analysis based on the digraph of the Jacobian matrix. We then prove two theorems originally given by A. N.

\({\Bbb{R}}^{d}\) 
by identifying pairs of boundary faces isometrically. Our existence proof exploits geodesic flow away from a source point v∈S, which is the exponential map to S from the tangent space at v. We characterize the cut locus (the closure of the set of points in S with more than one shortest path to v) as a polyhedral complex in terms of Voronoi diagrams on facets. Analyzing infinitesimal expansion of the wavefront consisting of points at constant distance from v on S produces an algorithmic method for constructing Voronoi diagrams in each facet, and hence the unfolding of S. The algorithm, for which we provide pseudocode, solves the discrete geodesic problem. Its main construction generalizes the source unfolding for boundaries of three-polytopes into

It is assumed that the two players move on the Euclidean plane with fixed but different speeds and they each have a lower bound on their achievable turn radii. Both players steer at each instant by choosing their turn radii value and directions of turn. By formulating the game as a game of kind, we characterize the regions of initial conditions that lead to capture as well as the regions that lead to evasion, when both the players play optimally. The game is then formulated as a game of degree to obtain time-optimal paths for the pursuer and evader inside a capture region. Besides, all possible scenarios are considered for both players that differ in speed ratios and maneuverability constraints. Solutions are provided for those cases using appropriate simulation parameters, which aid in understanding the characteristics of the game of two cars under a wide range of constraints.","Ritwik Bera1, Venkata Ramana Makkapati2 & Mangal Kothari

We specialize to the case \(N=G\) to study current groups. Finally, we apply these results to a class of holomorphic connections on the loop group \(H^{1/2}_b(S^{1},G)\).

In finite dimensions, the results cover the case of ellipsoids of initial states. A potential application of the results is inner and outer polyhedral approximation of reachable sets, which becomes extremely simple and almost universally applicable if these sets are known to be convex.

1697,Shifted symplectic structures,"This is the first of a series of papers about quantization in the context of derived algebraic geometry. In this first part, we introduce the notion of n-shifted symplectic structures (n-symplectic structures for short), a generalization of the notion of symplectic structures on smooth varieties and schemes, meaningful in the setting of derived Artin n-stacks (see Toën and Vezzosi in Mem. Am. Math. Soc. 193, 2008 and Toën in Proc. Symp. Pure Math. 80:435–487, 2009). We prove that classifying stacks of reductive groups, as well as the derived stack of perfect complexes, carry canonical 2-symplectic structures. Our main existence theorem states that for any derived Artin stack F equipped with an n-symplectic structure, the derived mapping stack Map(X,F) is equipped with a canonical (n−d)-symplectic structure as soon a X satisfies a Calabi-Yau condition in dimension d. These two results imply the existence of many examples of derived moduli stacks equipped with n-symplectic structures, such as the derived moduli of perfect complexes on Calabi-Yau varieties, or the derived moduli stack of perfect complexes of local systems on a compact and oriented topological manifold. We explain how the known symplectic structures on smooth moduli spaces of simple objects (e.g. simple sheaves on Calabi-Yau surfaces, or simple representations of π
1 of compact Riemann surfaces) can be recovered from our results, and that they extend canonically as 0-symplectic structures outside of the smooth locus of simple objects. We also deduce new existence statements, such as the existence of a natural (−1)-symplectic structure (whose formal counterpart has been previously constructed in (Costello, arXiv:1111.4234, 2001) and (Costello and Gwilliam, 2011) on the derived mapping scheme Map(E,T

1701,On Singularities of Certain Non-linear Second-Order Ordinary Differential Equations,"The method of blowing up points of indeterminacy of certain systems of two ordinary differential equations is applied to obtain information about the singularity structure of the solutions of the corresponding non-linear differential equations. We first deal with the so-called Painlevé example, which passes the Painlevé test, but the solutions have more complicated singularities. Resolving base points in the equivalent system of equations we can explain the complicated structure of singularities of the original equation. The Smith example has a solution with non-isolated singularity, which is an accumulation point of algebraic singularities. Smith’s equation can be written as a system in two ways. We show that the sequence of blow-ups for both systems can be infinite. Another example that we consider is the Painlevé-Ince equation. When the usual Painlevé analysis is applied, it possesses both positive and negative resonances. We show that for three equivalent systems there is an infinite sequence of blow-ups and another one that terminates, which further gives a Laurent expansion of the solution around a movable pole. Moreover, for one system it is even possible to obtain the general solution after a sequence of blow-ups.","Galina Filipuk

1705,Rozansky–Witten invariants via Atiyah classes,"Recently, L. Rozansky and E. Witten associated to any hyper-Kähler manifold X a system of ‘weights’ (numbers, one for each trivalent graph) and used them to construct invariants of topological 3-manifolds. We give a simple cohomological definition of these weights in terms of the Atiyah class of X (the obstruction to the existence of a holomorphic connection). We show that the analogy between the tensor of curvature of a hyper-Kähler metric and the tensor of structure constants of a Lie algebra observed by Rozansky and Witten, holds in fact for any complex manifold, if we work at the level of cohomology and for any Kähler manifold, if we work at the level of Dolbeault cochains. As an outcome of our considerations, we give a formula for Rozansky–Witten classes using any Kähler metric on a holomorphic symplectic manifold.",M.

1706,"Differential operators, pullbacks, and families of automorphic forms on unitary groups","This paper has two main parts. First, we construct certain differential operators, which generalize operators studied by G. Shimura. Then, as an application of some of these differential operators, we construct certain p-adic families of automorphic forms. Building on the author’s earlier work, these differential operators map automorphic forms on a unitary group of signature (n, n) to (vector-valued) automorphic forms on the product \(U^\varphi \times U^{-\varphi }\) of two unitary groups, where \(U^\varphi \) denotes the unitary group associated to a Hermitian form \(\varphi \) of arbitrary signature on an n-dimensional vector space. These differential operators have both a p-adic and a \(C^{\infty }\) incarnation. In the scalar-weight, \(C^{\infty }\)-case, these operators agree with ones studied by Shimura. In the final section of the paper, we also discuss some generalizations to other groups and settings. The results from this paper apply to the author’s paper-in-preparation with J. Fintzen, E. Mantovan, and I. Varma and to her ongoing joint project with M. Harris, J. -S. Li, and C. Skinner; they also relate to her recent paper with X.

This study aims to provide a survey of the recent relevant literature and findings in primary definitions, models, numerical methods and their applications. This review first offers an overview over the existing definitions proposed from different physical and application backgrounds, and then reviews several widely used numerical schemes in simulation. Moreover, as a powerful mathematical tool, the VO-FDE models have been remarkably acknowledged as an alternative and precise approach in effectively describing real-world phenomena. Hereby, we also make a brief summary on different physical models and typical applications.

The equilibrium states of the associated unlabeled stochastic dynamics are the Ginibre random point field and Dyson’s measures, which appear in random matrix theory. To solve the ISDEs we establish an integration by parts formula for these measures. Because the long-range effect of two-dimensional Coulomb potentials is quite strong, the properties of Brownian particles interacting with two-dimensional Coulomb potentials are remarkably different from those of Brownian particles interacting with Ruelle’s class interaction potentials.

We provide a residual-based a posteriori error estimate for a space-time formulation and the corresponding efficiently computable bound for the certification of the method. We introduce a Petrov-Galerkin finite element discretization of the continuous space-time problem and use it as our reference in a posteriori error control. The Petrov-Galerkin discretization is further approximated by the Crank-Nicolson time-marching problem. It allows to use a POD-Greedy approach to construct the reduced-basis spaces of small dimensions and to apply the Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM) to guarantee the efficient offline-online computational procedure. In our approach, we compute the reduced basis solution in a time-marching framework while the RB approximation error in a space-time norm is controlled by our computable bound. Therefore, we combine a POD-Greedy approximation with a space-time Galerkin method.","Michael Hinze1 & Denis Korolev

The solution (given in terms of the Newton diagram and the respective characteristic numbers) is known for quite some time, though the proofs are rather involved. We suggest a process of reduction of the non-commutative problem to its commutative analog, the problem of factorization of pseudopolynomials, which is known since Newton invented his method of rotating ruler. It turns out that there is an “automatic translation” which allows to obtain the results for formal factorization in the Weyl algebra from well known results in local analytic geometry.

Prior to 1965, Isaacs published his theory only in internal RAND papers and research memoranda. In his first RAND paper (Ref. 1), Isaacs sketched the basic ideas of zero-sum dynamic game theory. The ideas already included rudimentary precursors of the maximum principle, dynamic programming, and backward analysis. At the end of 1954 and the beginning of 1955, Isaacs summarized his research in four research memoranda (Refs. 3--6), which ten years later formed the basis of his famous book on Differential Games (Ref. 7).

1736,Error Estimates of High-Order Numerical Methods for Solving Time Fractional Partial Differential Equations,"Error estimates of some high-order numerical methods for solving time fractional partial differential equations are studied in this paper. We first provide the detailed error estimate of a high-order numerical method proposed recently by Li et al. [21] for solving time fractional partial differential equation. We prove that this method has the convergence order O(τ3−α) for all α ∈ (0, 1) when the first and second derivatives of the solution are vanish at t = 0, where τ is the time step size and α is the fractional order in the Caputo sense. We then introduce a new time discretization method for solving time fractional partial differential equations, which has no requirements for the initial values as imposed in Li et al. [21]. We show that this new method also has the convergence order O(τ3−α) for all α ∈ (0, 1). The proofs of the error estimates are based on the energy method developed recently by Lv and Xu [26]. We also consider the space discretization by using the finite element method. Error estimates with convergence order O(τ3−α + h2) are proved in the fully discrete case, where h is the space step size. Numerical examples in both one- and two-dimensional cases are given to show that the numerical results are consistent with the theoretical results.","Zhiqiang Li1,2 & Yubin Yan",Fractional Calculus and Applied Analysis,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1515/fca-2018-0039,"Primary 65M06,Secondary 65M12, 65M15, 26A33, 35R11"

Assuming that a suitable Riemannian measure of the distance or gap between any two states (as possible predictions) has been chosen, a scalar functionr(·) of the state is defined which characterizes the insensitivity of a nominal prediction to finite functional perturbations in the differential equations. The limiting behaviour ofr(·) near the nominal prediction defines a second rank symmetric positive definite tensorM, which provides an easily computed and convenient description of the insensitivity of the nominal predictionin each direction to ‘infinitesimal’ functional perturbations in the model.

In this paper, the authors consider the case of a quadratic involution. For a polynomial differential system with a linear part in the standard form (−y, x) in ℝ2, by using the method of regular chains in a computer algebraic system, the computational procedure for finding the necessary and sufficient conditions of the system to be time-reversible with respect to a quadratic involution is given. When the system is quadratic, the necessary and sufficient conditions can be completely obtained by this procedure. For some cubic systems, the necessary and sufficient conditions for these systems to be time-reversible with respect to a quadratic involution are also obtained. These conditions can guarantee the corresponding systems to have a center. Meanwhile, a property of a center-focus system is discovered that if the system is time-reversible with respect to a quadratic involution, then its phase diagram is symmetric about a parabola.","Jing Yang1,2, Ming Yang1,2 & Zhengyi Lu",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-021-0040-5,"Center,polynomial differential systems,quadratic involution,regular chains,time-reversibility"

1755,"On Post-Lie Algebras, Lie–Butcher Series and Moving Frames","
Pre-Lie (or Vinberg) algebras arise from flat and torsion-free connections on differential manifolds. These algebras have been extensively studied in recent years, both from algebraic operadic points of view and through numerous applications in numerical analysis, control theory, stochastic differential equations and renormalization. Butcher series are formal power series founded on pre-Lie algebras, used in numerical analysis to study geometric properties of flows on Euclidean spaces. Motivated by the analysis of flows on manifolds and homogeneous spaces, we investigate algebras arising from flat connections with constant torsion, leading to the definition of post-Lie algebras, a generalization of pre-Lie algebras. Whereas pre-Lie algebras are intimately associated with Euclidean geometry, post-Lie algebras occur naturally in the differential geometry of homogeneous spaces, and are also closely related to Cartan’s method of moving frames. Lie–Butcher series combine Butcher series with Lie series and are used to analyze flows on manifolds. In this paper we show that Lie–Butcher series are founded on post-Lie algebras. The functorial relations between post-Lie algebras and their enveloping algebras, called D-algebras, are explored. Furthermore, we develop new formulas for computations in free post-Lie algebras and D-algebras, based on recursions in a magma, and we show that Lie–Butcher series are related to invariants of curves described by moving frames.",Hans Z.

1769,Geometry of the spectral semidistance in Banach algebras,"Let A be a unital Banach algebra over ℂ, and suppose that the nonzero spectral values of a and b ∈ A are discrete sets which cluster at 0 ∈ ℂ, if anywhere. We develop a plane geometric formula for the spectral semidistance of a and b which depends on the two spectra, and the orthogonality relationships between the corresponding sets of Riesz projections associated with the nonzero spectral values. Extending a result of Brits and Raubenheimer, we further show that a and b are quasinilpotent equivalent if and only if all the Riesz projections, p(α, a) and p(α, b), correspond. For certain important classes of decomposable operators (compact, Riesz, etc.), the proposed formula reduces the involvement of the underlying Banach space X in the computation of the spectral semidistance, and appears to be a useful alternative to Vasilescu’s geometric formula (which requires the knowledge of the local spectra of the operators at each 0 ≠ x ∈ X). The apparent advantage gained through the use of a global spectral parameter in the formula aside, various methods of complex analysis can then be employed to deal with the spectral projections; we give examples illustrating the usefulness of the main results.",Gareth Braatvedt1 & Rudi Brits,Czechoslovak Mathematical Journal,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10587-014-0121-x,"asymptotically intertwined,Riesz projection,spectral semidistance,quasinilpotent equivalent"

Besides that, equivalent conservation laws (divergent identities) were found for families of rays and families of wavefronts in terms of their geometric characteristics. Thus, the geometric essence (interpretation) of the conservation laws obtained for the 2D eikonal equation was found. In this paper, 3D analogs of the results obtained are presented: differential conservation laws for the 3D eikonal equation and conservation laws (divergent identities of the form div F = 0) for families of rays and families of wavefronts, the vector field F expressed through classical geometric characteristics of the ray curves: their Frenet basis (the unit tangent vector, principal normal, and binormal), the first curvature, and the second curvature, or through the classical geometric characteristics of the wavefront surfaces: their normal, principal directions, principal curvatures, Gaussian curvature, and mean curvature.

It is assumed that no prior information is available about the functional form of the unknown profile. Therefore, the procedure is classified as the function estimation in inverse calculation. The temperature data obtained from the direct problem are used to simulate the temperature measurements. The accuracy of the inverse analysis is examined using the simulated exact and inexact temperature measurements. The results show that the excellent estimation of the fouling-layer profile can be obtained for the test case considered in this study. The technique presented in this study can be used in a warning system to call for pipe maintenance when the thickness of fouling exceeds a predefined criterion.","Wen-lih Chen

A geometric characterization (Theorem 2.2) of closed LNC sets with nonempty interior in a Hilbert space is supplied. It states that any proper line segment ]x,y[ contained in bd(Q), the topological boundary of Q, lies inside a relative neighborhood in bd(Q) composed of parallel line segments. It is shown that one half of this characterization, at least, generalizes to the setting of a locally convex Hausdorff topological vector space (LCHTVS). This leads to the observation that the set ext(Q) of extreme points of any LNC set Q in an LCHTVS is closed. Finally, it is proven that, in the same setting, all LNC sets are uniformly stable and, hence, stable.",Glenn C.

1818,On the Infinitesimal Rigidity of Homogeneous Varieties,"Let X⊂P be a variety (respectively an open subset of an analytic submanifold) and let x∈X be a point where all integer valued differential invariants are locally constant. We show that if the projective second fundamental form of X at x is isomorphic to the second fundamental form of a point of a Segre P× P, n,m≥2, a Grassmaniann G(2,n+2), n≥4, or the Cayley plane OP2, then X is the corresponding homogeneous variety (resp. an open subset of the corresponding homogeneous variety). The case of the Segre P2×P2 had been conjectured by Griffiths and Harris in [GH]. If the projective second fundamental form of X at x is isomorphic to the second fundamental form of a point of a Veronese v2(P) and the Fubini cubic form of X at x is zero, then X=v2 (P) (resp. an open subset of v2(P)). All these results are valid in the real or complex analytic categories and locally in the C∞ category if one assumes the hypotheses hold in a neighborhood of any point x. As a byproduct, we show that the systems of quadrics I2(P ⊔P)⊂ S2C, I2(P1× P)⊂ S2C and I2(S5)⊂ S2C16 are stable in the sense that if A ⊂S* is an analytic family such that for t≠0,A≃A, then A0≃A.

1819,An extremal criterion for epimorphic regeneration,"Many developing systems obey the principle of continuity: a morphogenetic field, when perturbed, tends to restore the normal local pattern of structures in its organ district. We have investigated physical field theories for a morphogenetic field, seeking constraints which would make a field theory produce the principle of continuity. We assume that during embryonic (ontogenetic) development a leg develops a pattern of positional values and a length which extremize a time-independent functional—the integral, over the length of the leg, of a function of positional values and position. For a single state variable which represents positional value, if a unique extremizing solution for the ontogenetically generated pattern and the length exists, and if no position-dependent functions other than the state variable appear in the integrand, then the principle of continuity is valid: in any regenerated leg the state variable is continuous and each region is locally identical to a region of the ontogenetically generated leg. This proposition is applied to three simple examples. For an exponential gradient and a Jacobi elliptic function there is a set of parameter values and boundary values for which a functional is minimized and the ontogenetically generated leg has an optimal length. Thus a leg which meets these constraints will obey the principle of continuity. However, a functional which when extremized gives a sinusoidal pattern does not in general provide a unique extremal length. Mathematical conditions are discussed under which an ontogenetically generated limb or a regenerated limb represents an asymptotically stable steady state. For a specific model of the transient dynamics in the exponential gradient case, the steady state gradient is asymptotically stable.","Bertrand S. Clarke1, Jay E. Mittenthal2 & Phillip A.

The physical origin of these problems is explained, and then the mathematical models are developed. Three notions emerge as central to the programme: positive operator-valued (POV) measures on a Hilbert space, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and fibre bundle formulations of quantum geometries. A close connection between the first two notions is shown to exist, which provides a natural setting for introducing a fibration on the associated overcomplete family of vectors. The introduction of group covariance leads to an extended version of harmonic analysis on phase space. It also yields a theory of induced group representations, which extends the results of Mackey on imprimitivity systems for locally compact groups to the more general case of systems of covariance. Quantum geometries emerge as fibre bundles whose base spaces are manifolds of mean stochastic locations for quantum test particles (i.e., spacetime excitons) that display a phase space structure, and whose fibres and structure groups contain, respectively, the aforementioned overcomplete families of vectors and unitary group representations of phase space systems of covariance.",S.

1835,Parallel spinors on globally hyperbolic Lorentzian four-manifolds,"We investigate the differential geometry and topology of globally hyperbolic four-manifolds (M, g) admitting a parallel real spinor \(\varepsilon \). Using the theory of parabolic pairs recently introduced in [22], we first formulate the parallelicity condition of \(\varepsilon \) on M as a system of partial differential equations, the parallel spinor flow equations, for a family of polyforms on an appropriate Cauchy surface \(\Sigma \hookrightarrow M\). The existence of a parallel spinor on (M, g) induces a system of constraint partial differential equations on \(\Sigma \), which we prove to be equivalent to an exterior differential system involving a cohomological condition on the shape operator of the embedding \(\Sigma \hookrightarrow M\). Solutions of this differential system are precisely the allowed initial data for the evolution problem of a parallel spinor and define the notion of parallel Cauchy pair \(({\mathfrak {e}},\Theta )\), where \({\mathfrak {e}}\) is a coframe and \(\Theta \) is a symmetric two-tensor. We characterize all parallel Cauchy pairs on simply connected Cauchy surfaces, refining a result of Leistner and Lischewski. Furthermore, we classify all compact three-manifolds admitting parallel Cauchy pairs, proving that they are canonically equipped with a locally free action of \({\mathbb {R}}^2\) and are isomorphic to certain torus bundles over \(S^1\), whose Riemannian structure we characterize in detail. Moreover, we classify all left-invariant parallel Cauchy pairs on simply connected Lie groups, specifying when they are allowed initial data for the Ricci flat equations and when the shape operator is Codazzi. Finally, we give a novel geometric interpretation of a class of parallel spinor flows and solve it in several examples, obtaining explicit families of four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds carrying parallel spinors.","Ángel Murcia

1838,Differential Categories Revisited,"Differential categories were introduced to provide a minimal categorical doctrine for differential linear logic. Here we revisit the formalism and, in particular, examine the two different approaches to defining differentiation which were introduced. The basic approach used a deriving transformation, while a more refined approach, in the presence of a bialgebra modality, used a codereliction. The latter approach is particularly relevant to linear logic settings, where the coalgebra modality is monoidal and the Seely isomorphisms give rise to a bialgebra modality. Here, we prove that these apparently distinct notions of differentiation, in the presence of a monoidal coalgebra modality, are completely equivalent. Thus, for linear logic settings, there is only one notion of differentiation. This paper also presents a number of separating examples for coalgebra modalities including examples which are and are not monoidal, as well as examples which do and do not support differential structure. Of particular interest is the observation that—somewhat counter-intuitively—differential algebras never induce a differential category although they provide a monoidal coalgebra modality. On the other hand, Rota–Baxter algebras—which are usually associated with integration—provide an example of a differential category which has a non-monoidal coalgebra modality.","R. F. Blute1, J. R.

1840,The Geometry of Two Generator Groups: Hyperelliptic Handlebodies,"A Kleinian group naturally stabilizes certain subdomains and closed subsets of the closure of hyperbolic three space and yields a number of different quotient surfaces and manifolds. Some of these quotients have conformal structures and others hyperbolic structures. For two generator free Fuchsian groups, the quotient three manifold is a genus two solid handlebody and its boundary is a hyperelliptic Riemann surface. The convex core is also a hyperelliptic Riemann surface. We find the Weierstrass points of both of these surfaces. We then generalize the notion of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface to a ‘hyperelliptic’ three manifold. We show that the handlebody has a unique order two isometry fixing six unique geodesic line segments, which we call the Weierstrass lines of the handlebody. The Weierstrass lines are, of course, the analogue of the Weierstrass points on the boundary surface. Further, we show that the manifold is foliated by surfaces equidistant from the convex core, each fixed by the isometry of order two. The restriction of this involution to the equidistant surface fixes six generalized Weierstrass points on the surface. In addition, on each of these equidistant surfaces we find an orientation reversing involution that fixes curves through the generalized Weierstrass points.",Jane Gilman1 & Linda Keen,Geometriae Dedicata,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10711-004-6556-8,"Fuchsian groups,Kleinian groups,Schottky groups,Riemann surfaces,hyper elliptic surfaces"

1842,Simulation of incompressible multiphase flows with complex geometry using etching multiblock method,"The incompressible two-phase flows are simulated using combination of an etching multiblock method and a diffuse interface (DI) model, particularly in the complex domain that can be decomposed into multiple rectangular subdomains. The etching multiblock method allows natural communications between the connected subdomains and the efficient parallel computation. The DI model can consider two-phase flows with a large density ratio, and simulate the flows with the moving contact line (MCL) when a geometric formulation of the MCL model is included. Therefore, combination of the etching method and the DI model has potential to deal with a variety of two-phase flows in industrial applications. The performance is examined through a series of numerical experiments. The convergence of the etching method is firstly tested by simulating single-phase flows past a square cylinder, and the method for the multiphase flow simulation is validated by investing drops dripping from a pore. The numerical results are compared with either those from other researchers or experimental data. Good agreement is achieved. The method is also used to investigate the impact of a droplet on a grooved substrate and droplet generation in flow focusing devices.","Haoran Liu1, Kai Mu1 & Hang Ding",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-016-2101-8,"etching multiblock method,complex geometry,multiphase flow,moving contact line (MCL),multiblock"

A choking horn is a family of cycles on an algebraic variety with the property that the cycles cannot be boundaries of nearby chains. The presence of choking horns is an obstruction to metric conicalness and the authors use this to prove that some classical isolated hypersurface singularities are not metrically conical. They also show that there exist countably infinitely many singular varieties, which are locally homeomorphic, but not locally subanalytically bi-Lipschitz equivalent with respect to the inner metric.

However, only very few construction strategies for discrete shearlet systems are known so far.In this paper, we take a geometric approach to this problem. Utilizing the close connection with group representations, we first introduce and analyze an upper and lower weighted shearlet density based on the shearlet group. We then apply this geometric measure to provide necessary conditions on the geometry of the sets of parameters for the associated shearlet systems to form a frame for L
2(ℝ2), either when using all possible generators or a large class exhibiting some decay conditions. While introducing such a feasible class of shearlet generators, we analyze approximation properties of the associated shearlet systems, which themselves lead to interesting insights into homogeneous approximation abilities of shearlet frames. We also present examples, such as oversampled shearlet systems and co-shearlet systems, to illustrate the usefulness of our geometric approach to the construction of shearlet frames.","Pisamai Kittipoom1, Gitta Kutyniok2 & Wang-Q Lim",Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00041-010-9163-0,"Amalgam spaces,Density,Frame,Geometry,Homogeneous approximation property,Shearlet,Shearlet group"

In terms of geometry, the rho-tau embedding of a parametric statistical model defines both a Riemannian metric, called “rho-tau metric”, and an alpha-family of rho-tau connections, with the former controlled by a single function and the latter by both embedding functions \(\rho \) and \(\tau \) in general. We identify conditions under which the rho-tau metric becomes Hessian and hence the \(\pm 1\) rho-tau connections are dually flat. For any choice of rho and tau there exist models belonging to the phi-deformed exponential family for which the rho-tau metric is Hessian. In other cases the rho–tau metric may be only conformally equivalent with a Hessian metric. Finally, we show a formulation of the maximum entropy framework which yields the phi-exponential family as the solution.","Jan Naudts

Using the same logical scheme, one constructs a differential principle on the basis of the vector equation of constrained motion of a mechanical system. In this form of notation, it is proposed to conserve the zero scalar products of reactions of ideal constraints and the vector δx.

1879,Some mathematical problems in computer vision,"Several interesting mathematical problems arising in computer vision are discussed. Computer vision deals with image understanding at various levels. At the low level, it addresses issues like segmentation, edge detection, planar shape recognition and analysis. Classical results on differential invariants associated to planar curves are relevant to planar object recognition under partial occlusion, and recent results concerning the evolution of closed planar shapes under curvature controlled diffusion have found applications in shape decomposition and analysis. At higher levels, computer vision problems deal with attempts to invert imaging projections and shading processes toward depth recovery, spatial shape recognition and motion analysis. In this context, the recovery of depth from shaded images of objects with smooth, diffuse surfaces require the solution of nonlinear partial differential equations. Here results on differential equations, as well as interesting results from low-dimensional topology and differential geometry are the necessary tools of the trade. We are still far from being able to equip our computers with brains capable to analyze and understand the images that can easily be acquired with camera-eyes; however the research effort in this area often calls for both classical and recent mathematical results.",A.

In practical applications, however, the underlying pseudo-Riemannian metric may often be degenerate, and such an excellent geometric structure is rarely defined on the entire space. To fix this trouble, in the present paper, we propose a novel generalization of the dually flat structure for a certain class of singular models from the viewpoint of Lagrange and Legendre singularity theory—we introduce a quasi-Hessian manifold endowed with a possibly degenerate metric and a particular symmetric cubic tensor, which exceeds the concept of statistical manifolds and is adapted to the theory of (weak) contrast functions. In particular, we establish Amari–Nagaoka’s extended Pythagorean theorem and projection theorem in this general setup, and consequently, most of applications of these theorems are suitably justified even for such singular cases. This work is motivated by various interests with different backgrounds from Frobenius structure in mathematical physics to Deep Learning in data science.","Naomichi Nakajima1 & Toru Ohmoto

This kind of brachistochrones presents characteristics different from the travel time brachistochrones, that were studied in [8, 9, 10]. In this article we formulate the variational problem in a general context; moreover, in the case of a stationary metric, we prove two variational principles and we determine the second order differential equation satisfied by the arrival time brachistochrone. Using these variational principles and techniques from Critical Point Theory we establish some results concerning the existence and the multiplicity of travel time brachistochrones with a given energy between an event and an observer.","Fabio Giannoni1,2 & Paolo Piccione1,",The Journal of Geometric Analysis,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02922047,"58E05,83Cxx"

The developed method makes it possible in a single, uniform way to find the solution to the gas-dynamic problem in the plane, cylindrical, and spherical cases for an initially uniform motionless gas. Equations were derived describing the evolution of the small perturbations of the shell in the case where the acceleration is time-dependent. The shell is assumed to be thin and structureless, and its mass is supposed to exceed significantly the mass of the gas surrounding the shell. The cases of the planar, cylindrical, and spherical geometries of the system are considered. The stability of the shell’s motion producing isentropic compression of the gas is considered with respect to the evolution of small perturbations of plane-wave and angularharmonic types. It is shown that under the isentropic compression of a gas, the increase in the shell’s perturbations of the plane-wave type is limited both in the planar and cylindrical geometries. The limiting growth in the amplitude of such perturbations is calculated. The increase in the perturbations of the angular-harmonic type is demonstrated to be unlimited both in cylindrical and in spherical geometries.

Different but equivalent characterizations of the smooth hyperbolic cosine function lead to different discretizations which are no longer equivalent. However, it turns out that there are still some interrelations. We are led to some explicit and recursive definitions. It is also natural that we study discretizations of the tractrix whose evolute is the hyperbolic cosine, and its relation to discrete surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature.

From the group theoretical standpoint, general relativistic mechanics is a more closed system than Newtonian mechanics. Quantized objects of these classical groups are closely related to the group of Fourier integral operators [12]. These can also be managed as regular Fréchet-Lie groups. However, there are many Fréchet-Lie algebras which are not the Lie algebras of regular Fréchet-Lie groups [13]. Thus, the enlargeability of the Poisson algebra is discussed in detail in this paper. Enlargeability is relevant to the global hypoellipticity [14, 15] of second-order differential operators.","Osamu Kobayashi1, Akira Yoshioka2, Yoshiaki Maeda3 & …Hideki Omori",Acta Applicandae Mathematica,1985,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01438267,58B25

Here we show that the generating principles of developable surfaces were also at the core of their study by Monge. In a historical context, from the beginning of the study of developable surfaces, to the contributions Monge made to the field, it can be seen that the nature of developable surfaces is closely related to the spatial intuition and treatment of space as defined by Monge through his descriptive geometry, which played a major role in developing an international language of geometrical communication for architecture and engineering. The use of developable surfaces in the architecture of Frank Gehry is mentioned, in particular in relation to his fascination with ‘movement’ and its role in architectural design.",Snežana Lawrence,Nexus Network Journal,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00004-011-0087-z,"developable surfaces,Gaspard Monge,descriptive geometry,ruled surfaces,Frank Gehry,Leonhard Euler"
1916,Rough sound waves in 3D compressible Euler flow with vorticity,"We prove a series of intimately related results tied to the regularity and geometry of solutions to the 3D compressible Euler equations. The results concern “general” solutions, which can have nontrivial vorticity and entropy. Our geo-analytic framework exploits and reveals additional virtues of a recent new formulation of the equations, which decomposed the flow into a geometric “(sound) wave-part” coupled to a “transport-div-curl-part” (transport-part for short), with both parts exhibiting remarkable properties. Our main result is that the time of existence can be controlled in terms of the \(H^{2^+}(\mathbb {R}^3)\)-norm of the wave-part of the initial data and various Sobolev and Hölder norms of the transport-part of the initial data, the latter comprising the initial vorticity and entropy. The wave-part regularity assumptions are optimal in the scale of Sobolev spaces: Lindblad (Math Res Lett 5(5):605–622, 1998) showed that shock singularities can instantly form if one only assumes a bound for the \(H^2(\mathbb {R}^3)\)-norm of the wave-part of the initial data. Our proof relies on the assumption that the transport-part of the initial data is more regular than the wave-part, and we show that the additional regularity is propagated by the flow, even though the transport-part of the flow is deeply coupled to the rougher wave-part. To implement our approach, we derive several results of independent interest: (i) sharp estimates for the acoustic geometry, which in particular capture how the vorticity and entropy affect the Ricci curvature of the acoustical metric and therefore, via Raychaudhuri’s equation, influence the evolution of the geometry of acoustic null hypersurfaces, i.e., sound cones; (ii) Strichartz estimates for quasilinear sound waves coupled to vorticity and entropy; and (iii) Schauder estimates for the transport-div-curl-part. Compared to previous works on low regularity, the main new features of the paper are that the quasilinear PDE systems under study exhibit multiple speeds of propagation and that elliptic estimates for various components of the fluid are needed, both to avoid loss of regularity and to gain space-time integrability.","Marcelo M.

Vinogradov in the late Seventies as a fundamental tool for the study of the algebro-geometric properties of jet spaces and differential equations. A spectral sequence arises from the contact filtration of the modules of forms on jet spaces of a fibring (or on a differential equation). In order to avoid serious technical difficulties, the order of the jet space is not fixed, i.e., computations are performed on spaces containing forms on jet spaces of any order. In this paper we show that there exists a formulation of Vinogradov's C-spectral sequence in the case of finite-order jet spaces of a fibred manifold. We compute all cohomology groups of the finite-order C-spectral sequence. We obtain a finite-order variational sequence which is shown to be naturally isomorphic with Krupka's finite-order variational sequence.","Raffaele Vitolo1,",Acta Applicandae Mathematica,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1015252824302,"fibred manifold,jet space,variational bicomplex,variational sequence,spectral sequence"

The minimal Lagrangian surface is equivariant for an SU(2, 1) representation of the fundamental group.

We show that all the representations in this neighbourhood are complex-hyperbolic quasi-Fuchsian by constructing for each a fundamental domain using an SU(2, 1) frame for the minimal Lagrangian immersion: the Maurer–Cartan equation for this frame is the Ţiţeica-type equation.

1924,On a special type of generalized Berwald manifolds: semi-symmetric linear connections preserving the Finslerian length of tangent vectors,"A generalized Berwald manifold is a Finsler manifold admitting a linear connection on the base manifold such that parallel transports preserve the Finslerian length of tangent vectors (compatibility condition). If the linear connection preserving the Finslerian length of tangent vectors has zero torsion then we have a classical Berwald manifold. Another important type of generalized Berwald manifolds admits semi-symmetric compatible linear connections. This means that the torsion tensor is decomposable in a special way. Among others the so-called Wagner manifolds belong to this special class of spaces. In the sense of Hashiguchi and Ychijyo’s classical results, Wagner manifolds play an important role in the conformal Finsler geometry as conformally Berwald Finsler manifolds. One of the main problems is the intrinsic characterization of compatible linear connections on a Finsler manifold. We are also interested in the inverse problem of compatible linear connections on Finsler manifolds. Let a metric linear connection \(\nabla \) on a Riemannian manifold be given. After formulating a necessary and sufficient condition for \(\nabla \) to be metrizable by a non-Riemannian metric function we present a geometric construction of the (non-Riemannian) indicatrix hypersurfaces in terms of generalized conics—in case of a Riemannian manifold the indicatrices are conics (quadratic hypersurfaces) in the classical sense. New perspectives of the theory of generalized Berwald manifolds have been supported by the solution of Matsumoto’s problem of conformally equivalent Berwald manifolds in 2005: the scale function between two non-Riemannian (classical) Berwald manifolds must be constant. The proof is based on metrics and differential forms given by averaging. They also play the central role in the intrinsic characterization of semi-symmetric compatible linear connections in general. Using average processes is a new and important trend in Finsler geometry. The so-called associated Riemannian metric is introduced by choosing the Riemann–Finsler metric to be averaged. Another important type of associated objects is the so-called associated Randers metric. The one-form perturbation of the associated Riemannian metric is given by the integration of the contracted-normalized Riemann–Finsler metric on the indicatrix hypersurface point by point. Some applications are also presented in case of Funk metrics. Since the associated objects inherit the compatibility properties, the generalized Berwald manifold theory for spaces of special metrics is of special interest. In what follows we present some recent results of the theory of generalized Berwald manifolds. Especially we focus on the case of semi-symmetric compatible linear connections. We also discuss the case of Randers metrics. Asanov’s Finsleroid-Finsler metrics will be characterized as the solutions of a conformal rigidity problem and we prove that a Finsleroid-Finsler manifold is a Landsberg manifold (Unicorn) if and only if it is a generalized Berwald manifold with a semi-symmetric compatible linear connection.","Csaba Vincze

1934,The Dynamics of Complex Box Mappings,"In holomorphic dynamics, complex box mappings arise as first return maps to well-chosen domains. They are a generalization of polynomial-like mapping, where the domain of the return map can have infinitely many components. They turned out to be extremely useful in tackling diverse problems. The purpose of this paper is:

To illustrate some pathologies that can occur when a complex box mapping is not induced by a globally defined map and when its domain has infinitely many components, and to give conditions to avoid these issues.


To show that once one has a box mapping for a rational map, these conditions can be assumed to hold in a very natural setting. Thus, we call such complex box mappings dynamically natural. Having such box mappings is the first step in tackling many problems in one-dimensional dynamics.


Many results in holomorphic dynamics rely on an interplay between combinatorial and analytic techniques. In this setting, some of these tools are:

the Enhanced Nest (a nest of puzzle pieces around critical points) from Kozlovski, Shen, van Strien (Ann Math 165:749–841, 2007), referred to below as KSS;


the Covering Lemma (which controls the moduli of pullbacks of annuli) from Kahn and Lyubich (Ann Math 169(2):561–593, 2009);


the QC-Criterion and the Spreading Principle from KSS.

 The purpose of this paper is to make these tools more accessible so that they can be used as a ‘black box’, so one does not have to redo the proofs in new settings.


To give an intuitive, but also rather detailed, outline of the proof from KSS and Kozlovski and van Strien (Proc Lond Math Soc (3) 99:275–296, 2009) of the following results for non-renormalizable dynamically natural complex box mappings:

puzzle pieces shrink to points,


(under some assumptions) topologically conjugate non-renormalizable polynomials and box mappings are quasiconformally conjugate.




We prove the fundamental ergodic properties for dynamically natural box mappings. This leads to some necessary conditions for when such a box mapping supports a measurable invariant line field on its filled Julia set. These mappings are the analogues of Lattès maps in this setting.


We prove a version of Mañé’s Theorem for complex box mappings concerning expansion along orbits of points that avoid a neighborhood of the set of critical points.

1937,Discrete Hodge operators," Many linear boundary value problems arising in computational physics can be formulated in the calculus of differential forms. Discrete differential forms provide a natural and canonical approach to their discretization. However, much freedom remains concerning the choice of discrete Hodge operators, that is, discrete analogues of constitutive laws. A generic discrete Hodge operator is introduced and it turns out that most finite element and finite volume schemes emerge as its specializations. We reap the possibility of a unified convergence analysis in the framework of discrete exterior calculus.",R.

1938,Laplacian Operators and Q-curvature on Conformally Einstein Manifolds,"A new definition of canonical conformal differential operators P

k
 (k = 1,2,...), with leading term a kth power of the Laplacian, is given for conformally Einstein manifolds of any signature. These act between density bundles and, more generally, between weighted tractor bundles of any rank. By construction these factor into a power of a fundamental Laplacian associated to Einstein metrics. There are natural conformal Laplacian operators on density bundles due to Graham–Jenne–Mason–Sparling (GJMS). It is shown that on conformally Einstein manifolds these agree with the P

k
 operators and hence on Einstein manifolds the GJMS operators factor into a product of second-order Laplacian type operators. In even dimension n the GJMS operators are defined only for 1 ≤  k ≤  n/2 and so, on conformally Einstein manifolds, the P

k
 give an extension of this family of operators to operators of all even orders. For n even and k > n/2 the operators P

k
 are each given by a natural formula in terms of an Einstein metric but they are not natural conformally invariant operators in the usual sense. They are shown to be nevertheless canonical objects on conformally Einstein structures. There are generalisations of these results to operators between weighted tractor bundles. It is shown that on Einstein manifolds the Branson Q-curvature is constant and an explicit formula for the constant is given in terms of the scalar curvature. As part of development, conformally invariant tractor equations equivalent to the conformal Killing equation are presented.",A. R.

The main idea is to impose the characteristic properties of the nets not only on elementary quadrilaterals but also on arbitrary parameter rectangles. For discrete planar quadrilateral nets, circular nets, \(Q^*\)-nets and conical nets we obtain a characterization of the corresponding discrete multi-nets. In the limit these discrete nets lead to some classical classes of smooth surfaces. Furthermore, we propose to use the characterized discrete nets as discrete extensions for the nets to obtain structure preserving subdivision schemes.","Alexander I.

In smooth normed planes, cycloids can be similarly defined, and they are characterized by their radius of curvature functions being solutions to eigenvalue problems of certain Sturm–Liouville equations. In this paper, we show that, for the eigenvalue \(\lambda = 1\), this equation is a previously studied Hill equation which is closely related to the geometry given by the norm. We also investigate which geometric properties can be derived from this equation. Moreover, we prove that if the considered norm is defined by a Radon curve, then the solutions to the Hill equation are given by trigonometric functions. Further, we give conditions under which a given Hill equation induces a planar Minkowski geometry, and we prove that in this case the geometry is Euclidean if an eigenvalue other than \(\lambda =1\) induces a reparametrization of the original unit circle.","Vitor Balestro

To prove the existence we use a generalization of the Birkhoff decomposition which is obtained by replacing the loop variable and loop groups in the original setting by a super derivation operator and groups of infinite order super micro- (i.e. pseudo-) differential operators. To show the uniqueness we generalize the fact that every flat connection admits horizontal sections to the case of an infinite dimensional super algebra bundle defined over an infinite dimensional super space. The usual KP system with non-commutative coefficients is also studied. The KP system is obtained from the super KP system by reduction modulo odd variables. On the other hand, the first modified KP equation can be obtained from the super KP system by elimination of odd variables. Thus the super KP system is a natural unification of the KP system and the modified KP systems.",Motohico Mulase,Inventiones mathematicae,1988,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01393991,"Horizontal Section,Derivation Operator,Loop Variable,Unique Solvability,Loop Group"

1950,Geometric Space–Frequency Analysis on Manifolds,"This paper gives a survey of methods for the construction of space–frequency concentrated frames on Riemannian manifolds with bounded curvature, and the applications of these frames to the analysis of function spaces. In this general context, the notion of frequency is defined using the spectrum of a distinguished differential operator on the manifold, typically the Laplace–Beltrami operator. Our exposition starts with the case of the real line, which serves as motivation and blueprint for the material in the subsequent sections. After the discussion of the real line, our presentation starts out in the most abstract setting proving rather general sampling-type results for appropriately defined Paley–Wiener vectors in Hilbert spaces. These results allow a handy construction of Paley–Wiener frames in \(L_2(\mathbf {M})\), for a Riemann manifold of bounded geometry, essentially by taking a partition of unity in frequency domain. The discretization of the associated integral kernels then gives rise to frames consisting of smooth functions in \(L_2(\mathbf {M})\), with fast decay in space and frequency. These frames are used to introduce new norms in corresponding Besov spaces on \(\mathbf {M}\). For compact Riemannian manifolds the theory extends to \(L_p\) and associated Besov spaces. Moreover, for compact homogeneous manifolds, one obtains the so-called product property for eigenfunctions of certain operators and proves cubature formulae with positive coefficients which allow to construct Parseval frames that characterize Besov spaces in terms of coefficient decay. The general theory is exemplified with the help of various concrete and relevant examples which include the unit sphere and the Poincaré half plane.","Hans G. Feichtinger1, Hartmut Führ2 & Isaac Z.

1955,"Elimination, fundamental principle and duality for analytic linear systems of partial differential-difference equations with constant coefficients","In this paper we investigate the solvability of inhomogeneous linear systems of partial differential-difference equations with constant coefficients and also the corresponding duality problem in how far the solutions of the corresponding homogeneous systems determine the equations. For ordinary delay-differential (DD) equations these behavioral problems were investigated in a seminal paper by Glüsing-Lürssen (SIAM J Control Optim 35:480–499, 1997) and in later papers by Habets, Glüsing-Lürssen, Vettori and Zampieri. In these papers the delay-differential operators are considered as distributions with compact support which act on smooth functions or on arbitrary distributions via convolution. The entire analytic Laplace transforms of the distributions with compact support play an important part in the quoted papers. In our approach the partial differential-difference operators belong to various topological operator rings \(A\) of holomorphic functions on subsets of \(\mathbb C ^n\) and are thus studied in the frequency domain, the arguments of these (operator) functions being interpreted as generalized frequencies. We show that the topological duals \(A^{\prime }\) of these operator rings with the canonical action of \(A\) on \(A^{\prime }\) have strong elimination and duality properties for \(_A A^{\prime }\)-behaviors and admit concrete representations as spaces of analytic functions of systems theoretic interest. In particular, we study systems with generalized frequencies in the vicinity of suitable compact sets. An application to elimination for systems of periodic signals is given. We also solve an open problem of the quoted authors for DD-equations with incommensurate delays and analytic signals.

1956,Numerical analysis of differential operators on raw point clouds,"3D acquisition devices acquire object surfaces with growing accuracy by obtaining 3D point samples of the surface. This sampling depends on the geometry of the device and of the scanned object and is therefore very irregular. Many numerical schemes have been proposed for applying PDEs to regularly meshed 3D data. Nevertheless, for high precision applications it remains necessary to compute differential operators on raw point clouds prior to any meshing. Indeed differential operators such as the mean curvature or the principal curvatures provide crucial information for the orientation and meshing process itself. This paper reviews a half dozen local schemes which have been proposed to compute discrete curvature-like shape indicators on raw point clouds. All of them will be analyzed mathematically in a unified framework by computing their asymptotic form when the size of the neighborhood tends to zero. They are given in terms of the principal curvatures or of higher order intrinsic differential operators which, in return, characterize the discrete operators. All considered local schemes are of two kinds: either they perform a polynomial local regression, or they compute directly local moments. But the polynomial regression of order 1 is demonstrated to play a special role, because its iterations yield a scale space. This analysis is completed with numerical experiments comparing the accuracies of these schemes. We demonstrate that this accuracy is enhanced for all operators by applying previously the scale space.",Julie Digne1 & Jean-Michel Morel,Numerische Mathematik,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-013-0584-y,"68U05,65D18"

This is done in three parts. In the first one we consider this problem in the most general form, proving the existence of solutions when \(\Omega \) is a bounded \(C^{2,\alpha }\) domain, under suitable conditions on f, with no restrictions on M besides completeness. In the second part we study the asymptotic Dirichlet problem when M is the hyperbolic space \({\mathbb {H}}^n\) and \(\Omega \) is the whole space. This part uses in an essential way the geometric structure of \({\mathbb {H}}^n\) to construct special barriers which resemble the Scherk type solutions of the minimal surface PDE.

Let \(\overrightarrow{\Delta }_k \) be the Hodge–de Rham Laplacian on differential k-forms with \(k \ge 1\). By the Bochner decomposition formula, \(\overrightarrow{\Delta }_k = \nabla ^* \nabla + R_k\), where \(\nabla \) denotes the Levi-Civita connection and \(R_k\) is a symmetric section of \(\mathrm{End}(\Lambda ^kT^*M)\). Under the assumption that the negative part \(R_k^-\) is in an enlarged Kato class, we prove that for all \(p \in [1, \infty ]\), \(\Vert e^{-t\overrightarrow{\Delta }_k}\Vert _{p-p} \le C ( t \log t)^{\frac{D}{4}(1- \frac{2}{p})}\) (for large t), where D is a homogeneous “dimension” appearing in the volume doubling property. This estimate can be improved if \(R_k^-\) is strongly sub-critical. In general, \((e^{-t\overrightarrow{\Delta }_k})_{t>0}\) is not uniformly bounded on \(L^p\) for any \(p \not = 2\). We also prove the gradient estimate \(\Vert \nabla e^{-t\Delta }\Vert _{p-p} \le C t^{-\frac{1}{p}}\), where \(\Delta \) is the Laplace–Beltrami operator (acting on functions).

The four space curves that generate such a double translation structure are parametrized by abelian integrals, so they are usually not algebraic.

1960,H.S.M. Coxeter’s Theory of Accessibility: From Mario Pieri to Marvin Greenberg,"In the 1960s, H. S. M. Coxeter adopted a set of incidence axioms similar to one O. Veblen and J. W. Young proposed in 1910, to study projective spaces for which a field of elements of a commutative number system is an algebraic model. Coxeter introduced a theory called “accessibility,” which is applicable to the study of conics defined in 1847 by G. K. C. von Staudt, and the partitioning of projective planes in terms of them. In a conversation of 1989, Coxeter revealed that he used ideas from an 1898 paper of M. Pieri to define the relation of accessible points in a continuity-independent projective plane. In 1979, M.J. Greenberg reinterpreted that relation in such a plane using incidence and order axioms from another of Coxeter’s works. We compare the axiomatic bases on which Coxeter, Greenberg, and Pieri construct projective planes with and without continuity, using synthetic methods to introduce analytic ones. We show how several of their publications intersect in significant ways. Other paths emerge from these investigations, such as one that examines the origins of a statement postulated by Pieri, often credited to Pasch, which Coxeter attributed to Veblen.","Elena Anne Corie Marchisotto

1962,Coupled systems of nonlinear wave equations and finite-dimensional lie algebras I,"We study coupled systems of nonlinear wave equations from the point of view of their formal Darboux integrability. By making use of Vessiot's geometric theory of differential equations, it is possible to associate to each system of nonlinear wave equations a module of vector fields on the second-order jet bundle — the Vessiot distribution. By imposing certain conditions of the structure of the Vessiot distributions, we identify the so-called separable Vessiot distributions. By expressing the separable Vessiot distributions in a basis of singular vector fields, we show that there are, at most, 27 equivalence classes of such distributions. Of these, 14 classes are associated with Darboux integrable nonlinear systems. We take one of these Darboux integrable classes and show that it is in correspondence with the class of six-dimensional simply transitive Lie algebras. Finally, this later result is used to reduce the problem of constructing exact general solutions of the nonlinear wave equations understudy to the integration of Lie systems. These systems were first discovered by Sophus Lie as the most general class of ordinary differential equations which admit nonlinear superposition principles.","P. J.

1964,Modeling and simulation for three-dimensional signal propagation in passive dendrites,"This paper presents a three-dimensional model for neuronal signal processing in passive dendritic branches. The approach is based on Maxwell’s equations, in particular, on the equation of continuity for the electric flux. The quantities of interest are the electric potentials in the intra- and extracellular domain as well as the membrane voltage. The model is given by an integral Laplace equation with a source term that models the current through the membrane. We give results based on the numerical solution of the three-dimensional model, and we compare the model with the well known one-dimensional cable equation. One of the features of the new model is that it directly accounts for the possibility to include detailed measured geometry of dendritic branches into a three-dimensional numerical simulation. As a result, we are able to show for the first time that there is a significant impact of the extracellular domain into the solution of neuronal signal propagation in passive dendrites.","Christine Voßen1, Jens P.

1970,Deformations of coisotropic submanifolds and strong homotopy Lie algebroids,"In this paper, we study deformations of coisotropic submanifolds in a symplectic manifold. First we derive the equation that governs C∞ deformations of coisotropic submanifolds and define the corresponding C∞-moduli space of coisotropic submanifolds modulo the Hamiltonian isotopies. This is a non-commutative and non-linear generalization of the well-known description of the local deformation space of Lagrangian submanifolds as the set of graphs of closed one forms in the Darboux-Weinstein chart of a given Lagrangian submanifold. We then introduce the notion of strong homotopy Lie algebroid (or L∞-algebroid) and associate a canonical isomorphism class of strong homotopy Lie algebroids to each pre-symplectic manifold (Y,ω) and identify the formal deformation space of coisotropic embeddings into a symplectic manifold in terms of this strong homotopy Lie algebroid. The formal moduli space then is provided by the gauge equivalence classes of solutions of a version of the Maurer-Cartan equation (or the master equation) of the strong homotopy Lie algebroid, and plays the role of the classical part of the moduli space of quantum deformation space of coisotropic A-branes. We provide a criterion for the unobstructedness of the deformation problem and analyze a family of examples that illustrates that this deformation problem is obstructed in general and heavily depends on the geometry and dynamics of the null foliation.

1973,Subordinated Gaussian random fields in elliptic partial differential equations,"To model subsurface flow in uncertain heterogeneous or fractured media an elliptic equation with a discontinuous stochastic diffusion coefficient—also called random field—may be used. In case of a one-dimensional parameter space, Lévy processes allow for jumps and display great flexibility in the distributions used. However, in various situations (e.g. microstructure modeling), a one-dimensional parameter space is not sufficient. Classical extensions of Lévy processes on two parameter dimensions suffer from the fact that they do not allow for spatial discontinuities [see for example Barth and Stein (Stoch Part Differ Equ Anal Comput 6(2):286–334, 2018)]. In this paper a new subordination approach is employed [see also Barth and Merkle (Subordinated gaussian random fields. ArXiv e-prints, arXiv:2012.06353 [math.PR], 2020)] to generate Lévy-type discontinuous random fields on a two-dimensional spatial parameter domain. Existence and uniqueness of a (pathwise) solution to a general elliptic partial differential equation is proved and an approximation theory for the diffusion coefficient and the corresponding solution provided. Further, numerical examples using a Monte Carlo approach on a Finite Element discretization validate our theoretical results.

We have solved the integer and noninteger order energy balance equation in order to analyse the temperature distribution in convective straight fins. We have compared our results with homotopy perturbation method (HPM), variational iteration method (VIM), and homotopy perturbation Sumudu transform method (HPSTM). The results show that the ANN–BHCS algorithm gives better results than other analytical techniques.

We have calculated the values of MAD, TIC, and ENSE for case 1 of the problem, and histograms of these metrics show the efficiency of our algorithm.","Ashfaq Ahmad1, Muhammad Sulaiman

1977,On the Use of ANOVA Expansions in Reduced Basis Methods for Parametric Partial Differential Equations,"We propose two different improvements of reduced basis (RB) methods to enable the efficient and accurate evaluation of an output functional based on the numerical solution of parametrized partial differential equations with a possibly high-dimensional parameter space. The element that combines these two techniques is that they both utilize analysis of variance (ANOVA) expansions to enable the improvements. The first method is a three-step RB–ANOVA–RB method, which aims to use a combination of RB methods and ANOVA expansions to effectively compress the parameter space with minimal impact on the accuracy of the output of interest under the assumption that only a selection of parameters are very important for the problem. This is achieved by first building a low-accuracy reduced model for the full high-dimensional parametric problem. This is used to recover an approximate ANOVA expansion for the output functional at marginal cost, allowing the estimation of the sensitivity of the output functional to parameter variation and enabling a subsequent compression of the parameter space. A new accurate reduced model can then be constructed for the compressed parametric problem at a substantially reduced computational cost as for the full problem. In the second approach we explore the ANOVA expansion to drive an hp RB method. This is initiated considering a RB as accurate as can be afforded during the online stage. If the offline greedy procedure for a given parameter domain converges with equal or less than the maximum basis functions, the offline algorithm stops. Otherwise, an approximate ANOVA expansion is performed for the output functional. The parameter domain is decomposed into several subdomains where the most important parameters according to the ANOVA expansion are split. The offline greedy algorithms are performed in these parameter subdomains. The algorithm is applied recursively until the offline greedy algorithm converges across all parameter subdomains. We demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and generality of these two approaches through a number of test cases.","Jan S.

1987,Curvature analysis of frequency modulated manifolds in dimensionality reduction,"Recent advances in the analysis of high-dimensional signal data have triggered an increasing interest in geometry-based methods for nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NDR). In many applications, high-dimensional datasets typically contain redundant information, and NDR methods are important for an efficient analysis of their properties. During the last few years, concepts from differential geometry were used to create a new range of NDR methods. In the construction of such geometry-based strategies, a natural question is to understand their interaction with classical and modern signal processing tools (convolution transforms, Fourier analysis, wavelet functions). In particular, an important task is the analysis of the incurred geometrical deformation when applying signal transforms to the elements of a dataset. In this paper, we propose the concepts of modulation maps and modulation manifolds for the construction of particular datasets relevant in signal processing and NDR. We consider numerical methods for analyzing geometrical properties of the modulation manifolds, with a particular focus on their scalar and mean curvature. In our numerical examples, we apply the resulting geometry-based analysis to simple test cases, where we present geometrical and topological effects of relevance in manifold learning.",Mijail Guillemard1 & Armin Iske,Calcolo,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10092-010-0031-8,"Nonlinear dimensionality reduction,Manifold learning,Signal processing,Fourier and wavelet analysis,Numerical differential geometry"

1993,Desuspension of splitting elliptic symbols I,"This paper provides an algorithm for the conversion of the index of an elliptic first-order differential operator A on the torus Y×S1 into the index of a canonically associated elliptic pseudo-differential operator Q and Y . It is supposed that Y is a closed smooth manifold and that A “splits” into ∂/∂t + Bt , where {Bt} is a family of self-adjoint elliptic operators on Y satisfying the periodicity condition B1 = g B0 g−1 for some unitary automorphism g . Then it will be shown that the operator Q ( the “desuspension” of A ) can be written down explicity in the form Q = P+ −gP− where P+ are projections onto the space of Cauchy data. In the second part , applications are given for the calculation of the index of the general linear conjugation problem (“cutting and pasting” of elliptic operators) , and the intimate interrelations between the related procedures of algebraic topology, spectral theory and functional analysis are explained .

Similarly to conditions obtained by Bailey on generalized complex structures, we find condition on a pair consisting of a weakly regular Jacobi structure and a transverse complex structure to come from a generalized contact structure. In this way, we are able to construct interesting examples of generalized contact bundles. As applications: (1) we prove that every five-dimensional nilmanifold is equipped with an invariant generalized contact structure; (2) we show that unlike the generalized complex case, all contact bundles over a complex manifold possess a compatible generalized contact structure. Finally, we provide a counterexample presenting a locally conformal symplectic bundle over a generalized contact manifold of complex type that does not possess a compatible generalized contact structure.","Jonas Schnitzer

These are discrete minimal surfaces in their own right. In our study of relative kinematics of infinitesimally flexible meshes, we encounter characterizations of flexibility and isothermicity which are of incidence-geometric nature and are related to the classical Desargues configuration.

Edge detection is first presented from the point of view of the affine invariant scale-space obtained by curvature based motion of the image level-sets. In this case, affine invariant maps are derived as a weighted difference of images at different scales. We then introduce the affine gradient as an affine invariant differential function of lowest possible order with qualitative behavior similar to the Euclidean gradient magnitude. These edge detectors are the basis for the extension of the affine invariant scale-space to a complete affine flow for image denoising and simplification, and to define affine invariant active contours for object detection and edge integration. The active contours are obtained as a gradient flow in a conformally Euclidean space defined by the image on which the object is to be detected. That is, we show that objects can be segmented in an affine invariant manner by computing a path of minimal weighted affine distance, the weight being given by functions of the affine edge detectors. The gradient path is computed via an algorithm which allows to simultaneously detect any number of objects independently of the initial curve topology. Based on the same theory of affine invariant gradient flows we show that the affine geometric heat flow is minimizing, in an affine invariant form, the area enclosed by the curve.","Peter J.

2030,Conical Singular Points and Vector Fields,"AbstractWe consider several examples of mechanical systems the configuration spaces of which have the form of smooth manifolds with a unique singular point: two intersecting (or tangent) curves on a two-dimensional torus, four curves on a four-dimensional torus with a common point, and a two-dimensional cone (cusp) in \({{\mathbb{R}}^{6}}\). The main problem presented in this paper is the calculation of the (co)tangent space above the singular point by means of various theoretical approaches. Outside singular points, the motion of the mechanisms in question is described in the context of classical mechanics. However, in the neighborhood of a singular point, terms like “tangent vector” and “cotangent vector” must have conceptually new definitions. In this paper, the approach of the theory of “differential spaces” is used. In the case of a conical singular point, to calculate (co)tangent space, we use two various differential structures: the algebra of functions locally constant near the cone vertex and the algebra of restrictions of smooth functions from enveloping space to a cone. In the first case, tangent and cotangent spaces at the cone vertex are zero. In the second case, the algebra of functions on the cotangent bundle consists of functions locally constant on the cotangent layer above the singular point.",S. N.

The dynamics is that of two identical cars, with constant speeds and bounded turn rates. The pursuer's surveillance zone is circular. The game of kind and the game of degree are solved for ratios of the surveillance radius to the minimal turn radius equal to or greater than π+2. A barrier is constructed, and regions of strategies are separated through the use of dispersal and universal surfaces. A synthesis of a composite game of two identical cars is outlined, covering the space outside the surveillance zone as well as that inside it.",I.

2033,Concurrent Implementation of the Optimal Incremental Approximation Method for the Adaptive and Meshless Solution of Differential Equations,"The optimal incremental function approximation method is implemented for the adaptive and meshless solution of differential equations. The basis functions and associated coefficients of a series expansion representing the solution are selected optimally at each step of the algorithm according to appropriate error minimization criteria. Thus, the solution is built incrementally. In this manner, the computational technique is adaptive in nature, although a grid is neither built nor adapted in the traditional sense using a posteriori error estimates. Since the basis functions are associated with the nodes only, the method can be viewed as a meshless method. Variational principles are utilized for the definition of the objective function to be extremized in the associated optimization problems. Complicated data structures, expensive remeshing algorithms, and systems solvers are avoided. Computational efficiency is increased by using low-order local basis functions and the parallel direct search (PDS) optimization algorithm. Numerical results are reported for both a linear and a nonlinear problem associated with fluid dynamics. Challenges and opportunities regarding the use of this method are discussed.","Michael Kokkolaras1, Andrew J.

2034, UG – A flexible software toolbox for solving partial differential equations," Over the past two decades, some very efficient techniques for the numerical solution of partial differential equations have been developed. We are especially interested in adaptive local grid refinement on unstructured meshes, multigrid solvers and parallelization techniques.
Up to now, these innovative techniques have been implemented mostly in university research codes and only very few commercial codes use them. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the multigrid solution and adaptive refinement for many engineering applications are still a topic of active research and cannot be considered to be mature enough for routine application. Secondly, the implementation of all these techniques in a code with sufficient generality requires a lot of time and know-how in different fields.
UG (abbreviation for Unstructured Grids) has been designed to overcome these problems. It provides very general tools for the generation and manipulation of unstructured meshes in two and three space dimensions as well as a flexible data layout. Therefore, it can serve on the one hand as a tool for exploring new algorithms and, on the other hand, a whole range of algorithms already implemented can be applied to complex problems.
In this paper, we show the software design structure of UG and explore some of the subsystems in more detail. Finally, we try to illustrate the capabilities of the approach with several non–trivial examples.

2037,Supersymmetry and Hodge theory on Sasakian and Vaisman manifolds,"Sasakian manifolds are odd-dimensional counterpart to Kähler manifolds. They can be defined as contact manifolds equipped with an invariant Kähler structure on their symplectic cone. The quotient of this cone by the homothety action is a complex manifold called Vaisman. We study harmonic forms and Hodge decomposition on Vaisman and Sasakian manifolds. We construct a Lie superalgebra associated to a Sasakian manifold in the same way as the Kähler supersymmetry algebra is associated to a Kähler manifold. We use this construction to produce a self-contained, coordinate-free proof of the results by Tachibana, Kashiwada and Sato on the decomposition of harmonic forms and cohomology of Sasakian and Vaisman manifolds. In the last section, we compute the supersymmetry algebra of Sasakian manifolds explicitly.

Based on the assumption of multiple time scale separation, a zeroth-order closed-form solution is obtained, enabling one to use realistic aerodynamic and propulsion data. Control strategies are approximated by explicit feedback expressions of the state variables and the aircraft performance parameters. The zeroth-order feedback approximation is compared to the optimal openloop solution of the game. This comparison confirms the validity of the FSPT approximation for sufficiently large initial distances of separation.",J. Shinar1 & N.

The some topics are studied also for the Riemannian curvature tensor of (M, g) and finally for a general tensor field of (1, k)-type.

2041,The Light Ray Transform in Stationary and Static Lorentzian Geometries,"Given a Lorentzian manifold, the light ray transform of a function is its integrals along null geodesics. This paper is concerned with the injectivity of the light ray transform on functions and tensors, up to the natural gauge for the problem. First, we study the injectivity of the light ray transform of a scalar function on a globally hyperbolic stationary Lorentzian manifold and prove injectivity holds if either a convex foliation condition is satisfied on a Cauchy surface on the manifold or the manifold is real analytic and null geodesics do not have cut points.  Next, we consider the light ray transform on tensor fields of arbitrary rank in the more restrictive class of static Lorentzian manifolds and show that if the geodesic ray transform on tensors defined on the spatial part of the manifold is injective up to the natural gauge, then the light ray transform on tensors is also injective up to its natural gauge. Finally, we provide applications of our results to some inverse problems about recovery of coefficients for hyperbolic partial differential equations from boundary data.","Ali Feizmohammadi1, Joonas Ilmavirta2 & Lauri Oksanen

2042,Rank one solvable p-adic differential equations and finite Abelian characters via Lubin–Tate groups,"We introduce a new class of exponentials of Artin–Hasse type, called π-exponentials. These exponentials depend on the choice of a generator π of the Tate module of a Lubin–Tate group \(\mathfrak{G}\) over \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). They arise naturally as solutions of solvable differential modules over the Robba ring. If \(\mathfrak{G}\) is isomorphic to \(\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_m\) over \(\mathbb{Z}_p\), we develop methods to test their over-convergence, and get in this way a stronger version of the Frobenius structure theorem for differential equations. We define a natural transformation of the Artin–Schreier complex into the Kummer complex. This provides an explicit generator of the Kummer unramified extension of \(\epsilon^\dagger_{K_{\infty}}\), whose residue field is a given Artin–Schreier extension of \(k(\!(t)\!)\), where k is the residue field of K. We then compute explicitly the group, under tensor product, of isomorphism classes of rank one solvable differential equations. Moreover, we get a canonical way to compute the rank one φ-module over \(\epsilon^\dagger_{K_\infty}\) attached to a rank one representation of \(\mathrm{Gal}(k(\!(t)\!)^{\mathrm{sep}}/k(\!(t)\!))\), defined by an Artin–Schreier character.",Andrea Pulita,Mathematische Annalen,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00208-006-0040-8,"Isomorphism Class,Differential Module,Algebraic Extension,Tate Group,Witt Vector"

We investigate \(\Phi _S\)-harmonic maps or stress-energy stationary maps between Riemannian manifolds. Liouville type theorems for \(\Phi _S\)-harmonic maps from complete Riemannian manifolds are established under some conditions on the Hessian of the distance function and the asymptotic behavior of the map at infinity. By an extrinsic average variational method in the calculus of variations (Han and Wei in \(\Phi \)-harmonic maps and \(\Phi \)-superstrongly unstable manifolds, 2019), we prove that any stable \(\Phi _S\)-harmonic map from or to a compact \(\Phi \)-SSU manifold (to or from any compact manifold) must be constant (cf. Theorems 6.1 and 7.1). We further prove that the homotopic class of any map from any compact manifold into a compact \(\Phi \)-SSU manifold contains elements of arbitrarily small \(\Phi _S\)-energy, and the homotopic class of any map from a compact \(\Phi \)-SSU manifold into any manifold contains elements of arbitrarily small \(\Phi _S\)-energy (cf. Theorems 8.1 and 9.1). As immediate consequences, we give a simple and direct proof of Theorems 6.1 and 7.1. These Theorems 6.1, 7.1, 8.1 and 9.1 give rise to the concept of \(\Phi _S\)-strongly unstable \((\Phi _S\)-SU) manifolds, extending the notions of strongly unstable \(({\text {SU}})\), p-strongly unstable (p-SU), \(\Phi \)-strongly unstable \((\Phi \)-SU) manifolds (cf.

2053,Convergence of the forward-backward algorithm: beyond the worst-case with the help of geometry,"We provide a comprehensive study of the convergence of the forward-backward algorithm under suitable geometric conditions, such as conditioning or Łojasiewicz properties. These geometrical notions are usually local by nature, and may fail to describe the fine geometry of objective functions relevant in inverse problems and signal processing, that have a nice behaviour on manifolds, or sets open with respect to a weak topology. Motivated by this observation, we revisit those geometric notions over arbitrary sets. In turn, this allows us to present several new results as well as collect in a unified view a variety of results scattered in the literature. Our contributions include the analysis of infinite dimensional convex minimization problems, showing the first Łojasiewicz inequality for a quadratic function associated to a compact operator, and the derivation of new linear rates for problems arising from inverse problems with low-complexity priors. Our approach allows to establish unexpected connections between geometry and a priori conditions in inverse problems, such as source conditions, or restricted isometry properties.

2055,Information geometry connecting Wasserstein distance and Kullback–Leibler divergence via the entropy-relaxed transportation problem,"Two geometrical structures have been extensively studied for a manifold of probability distributions. One is based on the Fisher information metric, which is invariant under reversible transformations of random variables, while the other is based on the Wasserstein distance of optimal transportation, which reflects the structure of the distance between underlying random variables. Here, we propose a new information-geometrical theory that provides a unified framework connecting the Wasserstein distance and Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence. We primarily considered a discrete case consisting of n elements and studied the geometry of the probability simplex \(S_{n-1}\), which is the set of all probability distributions over n elements. The Wasserstein distance was introduced in \(S_{n-1}\) by the optimal transportation of commodities from distribution \({\varvec{p}}\) to distribution \({\varvec{q}}\), where \({\varvec{p}}\), \({\varvec{q}} \in S_{n-1}\). We relaxed the optimal transportation by using entropy, which was introduced by Cuturi. The optimal solution was called the entropy-relaxed stochastic transportation plan. The entropy-relaxed optimal cost \(C({\varvec{p}}, {\varvec{q}})\) was computationally much less demanding than the original Wasserstein distance but does not define a distance because it is not minimized at \({\varvec{p}}={\varvec{q}}\). To define a proper divergence while retaining the computational advantage, we first introduced a divergence function in the manifold \(S_{n-1} \times S_{n-1}\) composed of all optimal transportation plans. We fully explored the information geometry of the manifold of the optimal transportation plans and subsequently constructed a new one-parameter family of divergences in \(S_{n-1}\) that are related to both the Wasserstein distance and the KL-divergence.","Shun-ichi Amari

We show that knowledge of the length of each geodesic, and where pairwise intersections occur along the corresponding geodesics allows for recovery of the geometry of (M, g) (assuming (M, g) admits a Riemannian collar of a uniform radius). We call this knowledge the ‘stitching data’. We then pose a boundary measurement problem called the ‘delayed collision data problem’ and apply our result about the stitching data to recover the geometry from the collision data (with some reasonable geometric restrictions on the manifold).","Reed Meyerson

In this context the square of the maximum amplification is the largest amplification of the kinetic energy of the disturbances whose knowledge is important in stability investigations and laminar-turbulent transition analysis. First, we reduce such a differential-algebraic system to an ordinary differential one. Then, the maximum amplification is computed as the matrix exponential norm for which a special low-rank approximation is used. To obtain an additional decrease in the computational cost, we use two initial differential-algebraic systems corresponding to coarse and fine grid approximations. The first one is used to compute a rough value of the maximum amplification, and the second one is used to refine the computation. We illustrate the efficiency of this approach with two sample flows of grooved-channel and boundary-layer types.","A. V. Boiko1, Yu. M. Nechepurenko2 & M.

We study finite covers between such surfaces and show that lifts of nonseparating curves to the nonseparating curve graph of the cover span quasiconvex subgraphs which are infinite diameter and not coarsely equal to the nonseparating curve graph of the cover. In the finite type case, we also reprove a theorem of Hamenstädt identifying the Gromov boundary with the space of ending laminations on full genus subsurfaces. We introduce several tools based around the analysis of bicorn curves and laminations which may be of independent interest for studying the geometry of nonseparating curve graphs of infinite type surfaces and their boundaries.

However, the case of real dimension 4 presented technical difficulties that led us to require fall-off conditions in this special dimension that are stronger than the Chruściel fall-off conditions that sufficed in higher dimensions. Nevertheless, the present article shows that techniques of four-dimensional symplectic geometry can be used to obtain all the major results of Hein-LeBrun

Assuming that the coefficients of the differential equation be smooth, we construct and analyze a higher order accurate finite difference method that converges uniformly with respect to the singular perturbation parameter.

A priori explicit bounds on the solution of the problem are established. These bounds on the solution and its derivatives are obtained using a suitable decomposition of the solution into regular and layer components. It is shown that the proposed method is \(L_{2}^{h}\)-stable. The analysis done permits its extension to the case of adaptive meshes which may be used to improve the solution.

The differential quadrature element method (DQEM) is then applied to discretize the nonlinear mathematical model in the spatial domain, An effective method is presented to deal with discontinuity conditions of multivariables in the application of DQEM. A set of DQEM discretization equations are obtained, which are a set of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations with singularity in the time domain. This paper also presents a method to solve nonlinear differential-algebra equations. As application, static and dynamical analyses of large deformation of frames and combined frame structures, subjected to concentrated and distributed forces, are presented. The obtained results are compared with those in the literatures. Numerical results show that the proposed method is general, and effective in dealing with discontinuity conditions of multi-variables and solving differential-algebraic equations. It requires only a small number of nodes and has low computation complexity with high precision and a good convergence property.","Yu-jia Hu

2083,On Weyl’s type theorems and genericity of projective rigidity in sub-Riemannian geometry,"Weyl (Zur Infinitisimalgeometrie: Einordnung der projektiven und der konformen Auffasung, Nachrichten von der K. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, Mathematisch-Physikalische Klasse, Göttinger Akademie der Wissenschaften, Göttingen, 1921) demonstrated that for a connected manifold of dimension greater than 1, if two Riemannian metrics are conformal and have the same geodesics up to a reparametrization, then one metric is a constant scaling of the other one. In the present paper we investigate the analogous property for sub-Riemannian metrics. In particular, we prove that the analogous statement, called the Weyl rigidity, holds either in real analytic category for all sub-Riemannian metrics on distributions with a specific property of their complex abnormal extremals, called minimal order, or in smooth category for all distributions such that all complex abnormal extremals of their nilpotent approximations are of minimal order. This also shows, in real analytic category, the genericity of distributions for which all sub-Riemannian metrics are Weyl rigid and genericity of Weyl rigid sub-Riemannian metrics on a given bracket generating distributions. Finally, this allows us to get analogous genericity results for projective rigidity of sub-Riemannian metrics, i.e., when the only sub-Riemannian metric having the same sub-Riemannian geodesics, up to a reparametrization, with a given one, is a constant scaling of this given one. This is the improvement of our results on the genericity of weaker rigidity properties proved in recent paper (Jean et al. in Geom Dedic 203(1):279–319, 2019).

In the classical examples the latter is the contribution of differential forms. This decomposition suggests a natural scheme to analyse new sheaves by determining these pieces and the gluing data.

2092,Geometry of Measures in Real Dimensions via Hölder Parameterizations,"We investigate the influence that s-dimensional lower and upper Hausdorff densities have on the geometry of a Radon measure in \(\mathbb {R}^n\) when s is a real number between 0 and n. This topic in geometric measure theory has been extensively studied when s is an integer. In this paper, we focus on the non-integer case, building upon a series of papers on s-sets by Martín and Mattila from 1988 to 2000. When \(0<s<1\), we prove that measures with almost everywhere positive lower density and finite upper density are carried by countably many bi-Lipschitz curves. When \(1\le s<n\), we identify conditions on the lower density that ensure the measure is either carried by or singular to (1 / s)-Hölder curves. The latter results extend part of the recent work of Badger and Schul, which examined the case \(s=1\) (Lipschitz curves) in depth. Of further interest, we introduce Hölder and bi-Lipschitz parameterization theorems for Euclidean sets with “small” Assouad dimension.",Matthew Badger1 & Vyron Vellis,The Journal of Geometric Analysis,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12220-018-0034-2,"Hölder parameterization,Assouad dimension,Uniformly disconnected sets,Geometry of measures,Hausdorff densities,Generalized rectifiability"

But it is only limited to the flow problems in regular regions. At the same time, here is no upwind mechanism to deal with the convective property of the fluid flow in traditional DQ method. A local differential quadrature method owning upwind mechanism (ULDQM) was given to solve the coupled problem of incompressible viscous flow and heat transfer in an irregular region. For the problem of flow past a contraction channel whose boundary does not parallel to coordinate direction, the satisfactory numerical solutions were obtained by using ULDQM with a few grid points. The numerical results show that the ULDQM possesses advantages including well convergence, less computational workload and storage as compared with the low-order finite difference method.","A. S. J.

In this paper we consider metric measure spaces and construct a parallel transformation of measures under the uniformization and hyperbolization procedures. We show that if a locally compact roughly starlike Gromov hyperbolic space is equipped with a measure that is uniformly locally doubling and supports a uniformly local p-Poincaré inequality, then the transformed measure is globally doubling and supports a global p-Poincaré inequality on the corresponding uniformized space. In the opposite direction, we show that such global properties on bounded locally compact uniform spaces yield similar uniformly local properties for the transformed measures on the corresponding hyperbolized spaces. We use the above results on uniformization of measures to characterize when a Gromov hyperbolic space, equipped with a uniformly locally doubling measure supporting a uniformly local p-Poincaré inequality, carries nonconstant globally defined p-harmonic functions with finite p-energy. We also study some geometric properties of Gromov hyperbolic and uniform spaces. While the Cartesian product of two Gromov hyperbolic spaces need not be Gromov hyperbolic, we construct an indirect product of such spaces that does result in a Gromov hyperbolic space. This is done by first showing that the Cartesian product of two bounded uniform domains is a uniform domain.","Anders Björn

One advantage of our approach is that every coefficient in the differential equations can be relatively easily determined.

We consider finite, real or complex frames and rotation or unitarily invariant potentials, and mostly specialize to Parseval frames, meaning the frame potential to be optimized is a function on the manifold of Gram matrices belonging to finite Parseval frames. Next to the known classes of equal-norm and equiangular Parseval frames, we introduce equidistributed Parseval frames, which are more general than the equiangular type but have more structure than equal-norm ones. We also provide examples where this class coincides with that of Grassmannian frames, the minimizers for the maximal magnitude among inner products between frame vectors. These different types of frames are characterized in relation to the optimization of frame potentials. Based on results by Łojasiewicz, we show that the gradient descent for a real analytic frame potential on the manifold of Gram matrices belonging to Parseval frames always converges to a critical point. We then derive geometric structures associated with the critical points of different choices of frame potentials. The optimal frames for families of such potentials are thus shown to be equal-norm, or additionally equipartitioned, or even equidistributed.",Bernhard G.

The solution of the SG system of equations is usually a very challenging task. A relatively new approach to the solution of the SG matrix equations is the reduced basis (RB) solver, which looks for a low-rank representation of the solution. The construction of the RB is usually done iteratively and consists of multiple solutions of systems of equations. We examine multiple approaches and their modifications to the construction of the RB, namely the reduced rational Krylov subspace method and Monte Carlo sampling approach. We also aim at speeding up the process using the deflated conjugate gradients (DCG).

For pKE metrics with non-zero scalar curvature this twistor distribution has exactly two integral leaves and is ‘maximally non-integrable’ on their complement, a so-called (2,3,5)-distribution. Our main result establishes a simple correspondence between the anti-self-dual Weyl tensor of a pKE metric with non-zero scalar curvature and the Cartan quartic of the associated twistor distribution. This will be followed by a discussion of this correspondence for general split-signature metrics which is shown to be much more involved. We use Cartan’s method of equivalence to produce a large number of explicit examples of pKE metrics with non-zero scalar curvature whose anti-self-dual Weyl tensor have special real Petrov type. In the case of real Petrov type D,  we obtain a complete local classification. Combined with the main result, this produces twistor distributions whose Cartan quartic has the same algebraic type as the Petrov type of the constructed pKE metrics. In a similar manner, one can obtain twistor distributions with Cartan quartic of arbitrary algebraic type. As a byproduct of our pKE examples we naturally obtain para-Sasaki-Einstein metrics in five dimensions. Furthermore, we study various Cartan geometries naturally associated to certain classes of pKE 4-dimensional metrics. We observe that in some geometrically distinguished cases the corresponding Cartan connections satisfy the Yang-Mills equations. We then provide explicit examples of such Yang-Mills Cartan connections.","Gil Bor1, Omid Makhmali

A geometry G in ℋ is extremal if no proper extension of G of the same rank is in ℋ.

A hereditary class is numerically regular if for every extremal geometry G in ℋ, |G|=h (rank(G)).

2129,Operator algebras in India in the past decade,"Operator algebras come in many flavours. For the purpose of this article, however, the term is only used for one of two kinds of self-adjoint algebras of operators on Hilbert space, viz., C*- algebras (which are norm-closed) or von Neumann algebras (which are closed in the topology of pointwise strong convergence or equivalently, in the weak-* topology it inherits as a result of being a Banach dual space). To be fair, there are a number of people in India (eg., Gadadhar Misra, Tirthankar Bhattacharyya, Jaydeb Sarkar, Santanu Dey, etc.,) who work on non-selfadjoint algebras, mostly from the point of view of connections with complex function theory; but in the interest of restricting the size of this paper, I confine myself here to selfadjoint algebras. I apologise for ways in which my own personal taste and limitations colour this depiction of operator algebras. Another instance of this arbitrary personal taste is a decision to concentrate on the work of younger people. Thus, the work of the more senior people who have worked in operator algebras is only seen via their collaborations with younger people: e.g., KRP via Srinivasan and Rajarama Bhat, Kalyan Sinha via Debashish, Partha, Arup, Raja, etc,. and me via Vijay, Srinivasan and Panchugopal.Not long ago, interest in operator algebras in India was restricted to the three centres of the Indian Statistical Institute. Now, I am happy to note that it has spread to IMSc, some IITs, IISERs, NISER, JNU,.... My role in this article has been merely that of compiling inputs from many active Indian operator algebraists that came to my mind. I wrote soliciting a response from a certain number of them, then put together the responses received. (I apologise to those people who were omitted in this process). My colleague, Partha, with the help of his collaborator Arup, agreed to take care of the C*-related inputs, while I take care of the von Neumann-related ones with the help of my collaborator Vijay.What follows are some areas of ongoing research done in von Neumann algebras in India and some names of people doing such work: (a) subfactors and planar algebras, (Vijay Kodiyalam of IMSc, Chennai); (b) quantum dynamical systems and complete positivity (Rajarama Bhat of ISI, Bengaluru); (c) E0 semigroups (R.

’s are linear forms in x, y, and z and λ is a real number. The coefficients of these linear forms, viewed as 3D vectors, are called multipole vectors of P. In this paper, we consider similar multipole representations of polynomial and analytic functions on other quadratic surfaces Q(x, y, z) =  c, real and complex. Over the complex numbers, the above representation is not unique, although the ambiguity is essentially finite. We investigate the combinatorics that depicts this ambiguity. We link these results with some classical theorems of harmonic analysis, theorems that describe decompositions of functions into sums of spherical harmonics. We extend these classical theorems (which rely on our understanding of the Laplace operator \(\Delta_{S^2}\)) to more general differential operators Δ

2140,"Monte carlo approximation of form factors with error bounded a priori
","The exchange of radiant energy (e.g., visible light, infrared radiation) in simple macroscopic physical models is sometimes approximated by the solution of a system of linear equations (energy transport equations). A variable in such a system represents the total energy emitted by a discrete surface element. The coefficients of these equations depend on the form factors between pairs of surface elements. A form factor is the fraction of energy leaving a surface element which directly reaches another surface element. Form factors depend only on the geometry of the physical model. Determining good approximations of form factors is the most time-consuming step in these methods, when the geometry of the model is complex due to occlusions.In this paper, we introduce a new characterization of form factors based on concepts from integral geometry. Using this characterization, we develop a new and asymptotically efficient Monte Carlo method for the simultaneous approximation of all form factors in an occluded polyhedral environment. The approximation error is bounded without recourse to special hypothesis. This algorithm is, for typical scenes, one order of magnitude faster than methods based on the hemisphere paradigm or on Monte Carlo ray-shooting.Let A be any set of convex nonintersecting polygons in R3 with a total of n edges and vertices. Let ε be the error parameter and let δ be the confidence parameter. We compute an approximation of each nonzero form factor such that with probability at least 1 - δ the absolute approximation error is less than ε. The expected running time of the algorithm is O((ε-2 log δ-1 )(n log2
n + K log n)), where K is the expected number of regular intersections  for a random projection of A. The number of regular intersections can range from 0 to quadratic in n, but for typical applications it is much smaller than quadratic. The expectation is with respect to the random choices of the algorithm and the result holds for any input.",M.

2141,The Minkowski norm and Hessian isometry induced by an isoparametric foliation on the unit sphere,"Let Mt be an isoparametric foliation on the unit sphere (Sn−1(1), gst) with d principal curvatures. Using the spherical coordinates induced by Mt, we construct a Minkowski norm with the representation \(F = r\sqrt {2f(t)} \), which generalizes the notions of (α, β)-norm and (α1, α2)-norm. Using the technique of the spherical local frame, we give an exact and explicit answer to the question when \(F = r\sqrt {2f(t)} \) really defines a Minkowski norm. Using the similar technique, we study the Hessian isometry Φ between two Minkowski norms induced by Mt, which preserves the orientation and fixes the spherical ξ-coordinates. There are two ways to describe this Φ, either by a system of ODEs, or by its restriction to any normal plane for Mt, which is then reduced to a Hessian isometry between Minkowski norms on ℝ2 satisfying certain symmetry and (d)-properties. When d > 2, we prove that this Φ can be obtained by gluing positive scalar multiplications and compositions of the Legendre transformation and positive scalar multiplications, so it must satisfy the (d)-property for any orthogonal decomposition ℝn = V′ + V″, i.e., for any nonzero x = x′ + x″ and \(\Phi (x) = \bar x = \bar x\prime + \bar x\prime \prime \) with \(x\prime ,\bar x\prime \in {\bf{V}}\prime \) and x″, \(x\prime \prime ,\bar x\prime \prime \in {\bf{V}}\prime \prime \), we have \(g_x^{{F_1}}(x\prime \prime ,x) = g_{\bar x}^{{F_2}}(\bar x\prime \prime ,\bar x)\). As byproducts, we prove the following results. On the indicatrix (SF, g), where F is a Minkowski norm induced by Mt and g is the Hessian metric, the foliation Nt = SF ∩ ℝ>0M0 is isoparametric.

We develop a general framework for construction and analysis of higher-order finite volume methods. Specifically, we establish the boundedness and uniform ellipticity of the bilinear forms for the methods, and show that they lead to an optimal error estimate of the methods. We prove that the uniform local-ellipticity of the family of the bilinear forms ensures its uniform ellipticity. We then establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniform local-ellipticity in terms of geometric requirements on the meshes of the domain of the differential equation, and provide a general way to investigate the mesh geometric requirements for arbitrary higher-order schemes. Several useful examples of higher-order finite volume methods are presented to illustrate the mesh geometric requirements.","Zhongying Chen1, Junfeng Wu1 & Yuesheng Xu1,",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-011-9201-8,"Finite volume methods,High order schemes,Dual grids,Optimal order of convergence,Mesh geometry requirements"

If the mutation rate to a selectively beneficial allele is sufficiently high, Pennings and Hermisson (Mol Biol Evol 23(5):1076–1084, 2006a) have shown, that it becomes likely, that a selective sweep is caused by several individuals. Such an event is called a soft sweep and the complementary event of a single origin of the beneficial allele, the classical case, a hard sweep. We give analytical expressions for the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between two neutral loci linked to the selected locus, depending on the recurrent mutation to the beneficial allele, measured by D and \({\widehat{\sigma_D^2}}\), a quantity introduced by Ohta and Kimura (Genetics 63(1):229–238, 1969), and conclude that the LD-pattern of a soft sweep differs substantially from that of a hard sweep due to haplotype structure.

Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) problems exist on Riemannian manifolds, and with the differential geometry framework which we have previously developed, we can now apply RO techniques to MDO. Here, we provide background theory and a literature review for RO and give the necessary formulae to implement the Steepest Descent Method (SDM), Newton’s Method (NM), and the Conjugate Gradient Method (CGM), in Riemannian form, on MDO problems. We then compare the performance of the Riemannian and Euclidean SDM, NM, and CGM algorithms on several test problems (including a satellite design problem from the MDO literature); we use a calculated step size, line search, and geodesic search in our comparisons. With the framework’s induced metric, the RO algorithms are generally not as effective as their Euclidean counterparts, and line search is consistently better than geodesic search. In our post-experimental analysis, we also show how the optimization trajectories for the Riemannian SDM and CGM relate to design coupling and thereby provide some explanation for the observed optimization behaviour. This work is only a first step in applying RO to MDO, however, and the use of quasi-Newton methods and different metrics should be explored in future research.",Craig Bakker1 & Geoffrey T.

This problem is directly related to Hadamard’s problem of describing differential operators satisfying the Huygens’ principle. On the basis of the Fourier method of separation of variables and the method of gauge-equivalent operators, an effective method for finding exactly solvable deformations depending on one variable is constructed.

While most existing fast schemes for this task rely on so called “iterative” solvers, the method described here solves the linear system directly (to within an arbitrary predefined accuracy). The method is described for the particular case of an operator defined on a square uniform grid, but can be generalized other geometries. For a grid containing N points, a single solve requires O(Nlog 2
N) arithmetic operations and 
\(O(\sqrt{N}\log N)\) 
storage. Storing the information required to perform additional solves rapidly requires O(Nlog N) storage. The scheme is particularly efficient in situations involving domains that are loaded on the boundary only and where the solution is sought only on the boundary. In this environment, subsequent solves (after the first) can be performed in 
\(O(\sqrt{N}\log N)\)

In other words, nonlinear coordinate systems, in the sense of differential geometry, are studied by taking into consideration the structure of smooth optimization problems and variable metric methods.Both the unconstrained and constrained cases are discussed. The present approach is based on the fact that the nonlinear coordinate transformation of an optimization problem can be replaced by a suitable Riemannian metric belonging to the Euclidean metric class. In the case of equality and inequality constraints, these questions are related closely to the right inverses of full-rank matrices; therefore, their characterization is a starting point of the present analysis. The main results concern a new subclass of nonlinear transformations in connection with the common supply of coordinates to two Riemannian manifolds, one immersed in the other one. This situation corresponds to the differentiable manifold structure of nonlinear optimization problems and improves the insight into the theoretical background of variable metric algorithms.

We endow the surface with a useful Riemannian metric which is closely related to normal curvature, and from this we re-calculate the Minkowski Gaussian and mean curvatures. These curvatures are also re-obtained in terms of ambient affine distance functions, and as a consequence we characterize minimal surfaces as the solutions of a certain differential equation. We also investigate in which cases it is possible that the affine normal and the Birkhoff normal vector fields of an immersion coincide, proving that this only happens when the geometry is Euclidean.","Vitor Balestro1, Horst Martini2 & Ralph Teixeira",Geometriae Dedicata,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10711-018-0380-z,"Affine normal field,Birkhoff–Gauss map,Birkhoff orthogonality,Blaschke immersion,Distance function,Dupin indicatrix,(weighted)  Dupin metric,Minimal surface,Minkowski Gaussian curvature,Minkowski mean curvature,Normed spaces,Riemannian metric"
2190,Measure of noncompactness and semilinear nonlocal functional differential equations in Banach spaces,This paper is concerned with the measure of noncompactness in the spaces of continuous functions and semilinear functional differential equations with nonlocal conditions in Banach spaces. The relationship between the Hausdorff measure of noncompactness of intersections and the modulus of equicontinuity is studied for some subsets related to the semigroup of linear operators in Banach spaces.

2204,Multigrid analysis of spatially resolved hepatitis C virus protein simulations,"Viruses are a major challenge to human health and prosperity. This holds true for various viruses which are either threatening Europe (like Dengue and Yellow fever) or which are currently causing big health problems like the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV causes chronic liver diseases like cirrhosis and cancer and is the main reason for liver transplantations. Exploring biophysical properties of virus-encoded components and viral life cycle is an exciting new area of current virological research. In this context, spatial resolution is an aspect that has not yet been received much attention despite strong biological evidence suggesting that intracellular spatial dependence is a crucial factor in the viral replication process. We are developing first spatio-temporal resolved models which mimic the behavior of the important components of virus replication within single liver cells. HCV replication is strongly associated to the intracellular Endoplasmatic Reticulum (ER) network. Here, we present the computational basis for the estimation of the diffusion constant of a central component of HCV genome (viral RNA) replication, namely the NS5a protein, on the surface of realistic reconstructed ER geometries. The basic surface partial differential equation (sPDE) evaluations are performed with UG4 using fast massively parallel multigrid solvers. The numerics of the simulations are studied in detail. Integrated concentrations within special subdomains correspond to experimental FRAP time series. In particular, we analyze the refinement stability in time and space for these integrated concentrations based on diffusion sPDEs upon large unstructured surface grids using heuristic values for the NS5a diffusion constant. This builds up a solid basis for future research not included in this presentation. e.g. the presented refinement stability analysis of the single sPDEs allows for parameter estimations for the NS5a diffusion constant. Our advanced Finite Volume/multigrid techniques also could be applied for studying life cycles of other viruses.","Markus M.

Consequently, standard fast direct solvers lose their efficiency since the linear system changes at each time step. This manuscript presents a new computational approach that avoids this issue by pre-constructing a fast direct solver for the wall ahead of time, computing a low-rank factorization to capture the changes due to the refinement, and solving the problem on the refined discretization via a Woodbury formula. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency of the solver in accelerating particulate Stokes simulations.","Yabin Zhang

2213,Algebraic leaves of algebraic foliations over number fields," — We prove an algebraicity criterion for leaves of algebraic foliations defined over number fields. Namely, consider a number field K embedded in C, a smooth algebraic variety X over K, equipped with a K-rational point P, and F an algebraic subbundle of the its tangent bundle TX, defined over K. Assume moreover that the vector bundle F is involutive, i.e., closed unter Lie bracket. Then it defines an holomorphic foliation of the analytic mainfold X(C), and one may consider its leaf ℱ through P. We prove that ℱ is algebraic if the following local conditions are satisfied:
i) For almost every prime ideal p of the ring of integers 𝒪K of the number field K, the p-curvature of the reduction modulo p of the involutive bundle F vanishes at P (where p denotes the characteristic of the residue field 𝒪K
/
p
).
ii) The analytic manifold ℱ satisfies the Liouville property; this arises, in particular, if ℱ is the image by some holomorphic map of the complement in a complex algebraic variety of a closed analytic subset.This algebraicity criterion unifies and extends various results of D. V. and G. V. Chudnovsky, André, and Graftieaux, and also admits new consequences. For instance, applied to an algebraic group G over K, it shows that a K-Lie subalgebra h of Lie G is algebraic if and only if for almost every non-zero prime ideal p of 𝒪K
, of residue characteristic p, the reduction modulo p of h is a restricted Lie subalgebra of the reduction modulo p of Lie G (i.e., is stable under p-th powers). This solves a conjecture of Ekedahl and Shepherd-Barron.The algebraicity criterion above follows from a more basic algebraicity criterion concerning smooth formal germs in algebraic varieties over number fields. The proof of the latter relies on “transcendence techniques”, recast in a modern geometric version involving elementary concepts of Arakelov geometry, and on some analytic estimates, related to the First Main Theorem of higher-dimensional Nevanlinna theory.",Jean-Benoît Bost,Publications Mathématiques de l'Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10240-001-8191-3,"Algebraic Variety,Number Field,Holomorphic Foliation,Reduction Modulo,Algebraicity Criterion"

Such techniques yield a version for Kähler affine metrics of Yau’s Schwarz lemma for volume forms. By a theorem of Cheng and Yau, there is a canonical Kähler affine Einstein metric on a proper convex domain, and the Schwarz lemma gives a direct proof of its uniqueness up to homothety. The potential for this metric is a function canonically associated to the cone, characterized by the property that its level sets are hyperbolic affine spheres foliating the cone. It is shown that for an \(n\)-dimensional cone, a rescaling of the canonical potential is an \(n\)-normal barrier function in the sense of interior point methods for conic programming. It is explained also how to construct from the canonical potential Monge-Ampère metrics of both Riemannian and Lorentzian signatures, and a mean curvature zero conical Lagrangian submanifold of the flat para-Kähler space.",Daniel J.

2215,Manifold Learning with Arbitrary Norms,"Manifold learning methods play a prominent role in nonlinear dimensionality reduction and other tasks involving high-dimensional data sets with low intrinsic dimensionality. Many of these methods are graph-based: they associate a vertex with each data point and a weighted edge with each pair. Existing theory shows that the Laplacian matrix of the graph converges to the Laplace–Beltrami operator of the data manifold, under the assumption that the pairwise affinities are based on the Euclidean norm. In this paper, we determine the limiting differential operator for graph Laplacians constructed using any norm. Our proof involves an interplay between the second fundamental form of the manifold and the convex geometry of the given norm’s unit ball. To demonstrate the potential benefits of non-Euclidean norms in manifold learning, we consider the task of mapping the motion of large molecules with continuous variability. In a numerical simulation we show that a modified Laplacian eigenmaps algorithm, based on the Earthmover’s distance, outperforms the classic Euclidean Laplacian eigenmaps, both in terms of computational cost and the sample size needed to recover the intrinsic geometry.","Joe Kileel

The case of the Finsler-Jacobi structure appears if the initial metric is chosen such that the energy of the given vector field is constant (Sec. 1). At the end of Sec. 1 are formulated open problems regarding some extensions of geometric dynamics.Adequate structures on the tangent bundle describe the geometric dynamics in the Hamilton language (Sec. 2).Section 3 proves the existence of a Finsler-Jacobi structure induced by an almost contact metric structure.The theory is applied to electromagnetic dynamical systems (the starting point of our theory), offering new principles of unification of the gravitation and the electromagnetism. Also, here, one enounces open problems regarding the geometric dynamics induced by the electric intensity and magnetizing force (Sec. 4).From the geometrical point of view, we create a wider class of Riemann-Jacobi, Riemann-Jacobi-Lagrange, or Finsler-Jacobi manifolds ensuring that all trajectories of a given vector field are geodesics. Having T1M2n+1 in mind, the problem of creating a wider class of Riemannian manifolds, in which there exists a vector field ξ such that (1) all trajectories of the vector field ξ are geodesics; (2) the flow defined by ξ is incompressible; (3) the condition which corresponds to the property that ξ is the associate vector field of the contact structure is satisfied;was studied intensively by S. Sasaki. The results were not satisfactory, but Sasaki discovered (φ, ξ, ξ η)-structures [10].",Constantin Udrişte,Southeast Asian Bulletin of Mathematics,2000,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10012-000-0313-1,"Lorentz-Udrişte world-force law,Lagrangian,Hamiltonian,electromagnetic dynamical system"

Using the Nirenberg Frobenius Theorem [12], it follows that these are reducible Riemannian manifolds, whose metric is locally a sum of a Kähler and of a Riemann metric, and we are calling thempartially Kähler manifolds.After a general presentation of these manifolds (including a general presentation of the complex integrable plane fields) we are discussing harmonic forms, Betti numbers, and Dolbeault cohomology.

2225,Towards Geometric Integration of Rough Differential Forms,"We provide a draft of a theory of geometric integration of “rough differential forms” which are generalizations of classical (smooth) differential forms to similar objects with very low regularity, for instance, involving Hölder continuous functions that may be nowhere differentiable. Borrowing ideas from the theory of rough paths, we show that such a geometric integration can be constructed substituting appropriately differentials with more general asymptotic expansions. This can be seen as the basis of geometric integration similar to that used in geometric measure theory, but without any underlying differentiable structure, thus allowing Lipschitz functions and rectifiable sets to be substituted by far less regular objects (e.g. Hölder functions and their images which may be purely unrectifiable). Our construction includes both the one-dimensional Young integral and multidimensional integrals introduced recently by Züst, and provides also an alternative (and more geometric) view on the standard construction of rough paths. To simplify the exposition, we limit ourselves to integration of rough k-forms with \(k\le 2\).","Eugene Stepanov1,2 & Dario Trevisan

It combines a least-squares kernel collocation method with a surface-type intrinsic approach. Therefore, we can use each pair for discrete point sets, RBF kernels (globally and restrictedly), trial spaces, and some essential assumptions, for the search of least-squares solutions in bulks and on surfaces respectively. We first give error estimates for domain-type Robin-boundary problems. Based on this and existing results for surface PDEs, we discuss the theoretical requirements for the employed Sobolev kernels. Then, we select the orders of smoothness for the kernels in bulks and on surfaces. Lastly, several numerical experiments are demonstrated to test the robustness of the coupled method for accuracy and convergence rates under different settings.",Meng Chen1 & Leevan Ling,Journal of Scientific Computing,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-019-01020-2,"Meshless collocation methods,Coupled bulk–surface PDEs,Smoothness orders of global and restricted kernels,Error estimate"

2235,The Extinction Problem for Three-dimensional Inward Solidification,"The one-phase Stefan problem for the inward solidification of a three-dimensional body of liquid that is initially at its fusion temperature is considered. In particular, the shape and speed of the solid-melt interface is described at times just before complete freezing takes place, as is the temperature field in the vicinity of the extinction point. This is accomplished for general Stefan numbers by employing the Baiocchi transform. Other previous results for this problem are confirmed, for example the asymptotic analysis reveals the interface ultimately approaches an ellipsoid in shape, and furthermore, the accuracy of these results is improved. The results are arbitrary up to constants of integration that depend physically on both the Stefan number and the shape of the fixed boundary of the liquid region. In general it is not possible to determine this dependence analytically; however, the limiting case of large Stefan number provides an exception. For this limit a rather complete asymptotic picture is presented, and a recipe for the time it takes for complete freezing to occur is derived. The results presented here for fully three-dimensional domains complement and extend those given by McCue et al.[Proc. R. Soc. London A 459 (2003) 977], which are for two dimensions only, and for which a significantly different time dependence occurs.","Scott W. Mccue2, John R. King1 & David S.

The latter is a manifold with boundary, with the boundary being viewed as points “at infinity.” In analogy with the classical case, a Lagrangian distribution is associated with a submanifold \(\Lambda \) of the compactified cotangent bundle of X. The submanifold \(\Lambda \) is Lagrangian with respect to a symplectic structure induced by the scattering geometry of X. Our analysis relies on the parameterization properties of \(\Lambda \) by means of local phase functions, and the study of the maps which preserve the scattering structure. We study the principal symbol map associating Lagrangian distributions with sections of a line bundle over \(\Lambda \). In particular, we establish the principal symbol short exact sequence.","Sandro Coriasco

Our main results generalize classical results due to Groisser and Taubes in the particular case of the flat 3-dimensional Euclidean space \({\mathbb {R}}^3\). Indeed, we prove the integrality of the monopole number, or charge, of finite energy configurations, and derive the classical energy formula establishing monopoles as absolute minima. Moreover, we prove that the covariant derivative of the Higgs field of a critical point of the energy decays quadratically along the end and that its transverse component with respect to the Higgs field, as well as the corresponding component of the curvature of the underlying connection, actually decay exponentially. Additionally, under the assumption of positive Gaussian curvature on the asymptotic link, we prove that the curvature of any critical point connection decays quadratically. Furthermore, we deduce that any irreducible critical point converges uniformly along the conical end to a limiting configuration at infinity consisting of a reducible Yang–Mills connection and a parallel Higgs field.","Daniel Fadel

2238,Parabolic conformally symplectic structures II: parabolic contactification,"Parabolic almost conformally symplectic structures were introduced in the first part of this series of articles as a class of geometric structures which have an underlying almost conformally symplectic structure. If this underlying structure is conformally symplectic, then one obtains a PCS-structure. In the current article, we relate PCS-structures to parabolic contact structures. Starting from a parabolic contact structure with a transversal infinitesimal automorphism, we first construct a natural PCS-structure on any local leaf space of the corresponding foliation. Then we develop a parabolic version of contactification to show that any PCS-structure can be locally realized (uniquely up to isomorphism) in this way. In the second part of the paper, these results are extended to an analogous correspondence between contact projective structures and so-called conformally Fedosov structures. The developments in this article provide the technical background for a construction of sequences and complexes of differential operators which are naturally associated to PCS-structures by pushing down BGG sequences on parabolic contact structures. This is the topic of the third part of this series of articles.","Andreas Čap

Poincaré's epistemology is also one of the main references for logical empiricism, and the relationship between Poincaré and Enriques allows us to study the matrices of modern epistemology. Even the new concept of space-time proposed by Picasso is closely connected to Poincaré’s epistemology. The epistemological and philosophical problems investigated by Poincaré mainly concern deterministic chaos, the concept of space in geometry, the foundations of mathematics and physics and the definition of a general philosophy of science, and also touches on aspects related to morality and materialism. One might say that the philosophy of Poincaré is taken to the limit of modernity, to the threshold of twentieth-century epistemology. Poincaré was a careful interpreter of his time, always open to everything new in all sectors of the physics and mathematics, and able to discuss frankly the languages and theories of his fellow philosophers.",Gaspare Polizzi,Lettera Matematica,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40329-013-0009-x,"Epistemology,Philosophy of science,Conventionalism,Non-Euclidean geometry,Deterministic chaos,Materialism"

2255,Modeling water flow through arterial tissue,"A simple model of, water flow through deformable porous media has been developed with emphasis on application to arterial walls. The model incorporates a strain-dependent permeability function into Darcy's Law which is coupled, to the force balance for the bulk material. A simple analytical expression relating water flux (volume flux) to pressure differential is developed which shows how strain-dependent permeability can lead to a reduction in hydraulic conductivity with increasing differential pressure as observed in experiments with arteries. The variation of permeability with position in the wall, which may influence the convective diffusion of macromolecules, is determined for both cylindrical and planar segments and a marked influence of geometry is noted.",M.

2256,Koszul duality in algebraic topology,"The most prevalent examples of Koszul duality of operads are the self-duality of the associative operad and the duality between the Lie and commutative operads. At the level of algebras and coalgebras, the former duality was first noticed as such by Moore, as announced in his ICM talk at Nice (Moore in Actes du Congrès International des Mathématiciens, Tome 1. Gauthier-Villars, Paris, pp. 335–339, 1971). This particular duality has typically been called Moore duality, and some prefer to call the general phenomenon Koszul–Moore duality. The second duality at the level of algebras was realized in the seminal work of Quillen on rational homotopy theory (Quillen in Ann Math 90(2):205–295, 1969). Our aim in these notes based on our talk at the Luminy workshop on Operads in 2009 is to try to provide some historical, topological context for these two classical algebraic dualities. We first review the original cobar and bar constructions used to study loop spaces and classifying spaces, emphasizing the less-familiar geometry of the cobar construction. Then, after some elementary topology, we state duality between bar and cobar complexes in that setting. Before explaining Quillen’s work, we also share some other ideas—calculations of Cartan–Serre and Milnor–Moore and philosophy of Eckmann–Hilton—which may have influenced him. After stating Quillen’s duality, we share some recent work which relates these constructions to geometry through Hopf invariants and in particular linking phenomena.",Dev P.

2268,Periodic Solutions and Invariant Manifolds for an Even-Order Differential Equation with Power Nonlinearity,"The PDE Δm
u = u|u|p–1, with \({m\in\mathbb{N}}\) and \({p\in(1,\infty)}\), serves as a paradigm for a large class of higher-order elliptic equations with power-like nonlinearities. In studying radially symmetric solutions of this PDE and their asymptotic behavior, it is of critical importance to understand the dynamics of the associated ODE, u
(2m) = u|u|p–1, which is the subject of the present paper. Most solutions of the ODE blow up in finite time, diverging to either ∞ or −∞. In the phase space \({\mathbb{R}^{2m}}\), the orbits of these two types of solutions are separated by a (2m−1)-dimensional manifold \({\fancyscript{M}}\), which is unordered and homeomorphic to each of the coordinate hyperplanes under orthogonal projection. Solutions with orbits on \({\fancyscript{M}}\) do not blow up or, else, are unbounded from above and from below (oscillatory blow-up). In the second-order case, \({\fancyscript{M}}\) coincides with the stable manifold of the trivial equilibrium. In the fourth-order case, which is our main focus, \({\fancyscript{M}}\) contains a two-dimensional manifold \({\fancyscript{M}_0}\) of periodic orbits. There exists a unique periodic solution \({\bar u}\) with \({\bar u(0)=1}\) and \({\bar u'(0)=0}\), which shares most of the symmetry properties of the common cosine; all nontrivial periodic solutions are obtained from \({\bar u}\) via scaling and phase-shifting. Every solution with orbit on \({\fancyscript{M}\setminus\fancyscript{M}_0}\) converges to either the trivial equilibrium or one of the nontrivial periodic orbits; oscillatory blow-up does not occur. In higher-order cases, the structure of the manifold \({\fancyscript{M}}\) remains largely open.",Monica Lazzo1 & Paul G.

2271,On the lack of equivalence between differential and integral forms of the Caputo-type fractional problems,"In this pages, we discuss the problem of equivalence between fractional differential and integral problems. Although the said problem was studied for ordinary derivatives, it makes some troubles in the case of fractional derivatives. This paper dealing with the question revealing the equivalence between the boundary value problems for Caputo-type fractional differential equations and the corresponding integral form. One of our main part is to determine the scope of equivalence of such problems. However, with the help of appropriate examples, we will show that even for the Hölderian functions, but being off the space of absolutely continuous functions, the equivalence between the Caputo-type fractional differential problems and the corresponding integral forms can be lost. As a pursuit of this, we will show here that, the main results obtained by many researchers contained a common mathematical error in the proof of the equivalence of the boundary value problems for Caputo-type fractional differential equations and the corresponding integral forms. In this connection, we are going to slightly modify the definition of the Caputo-type fractional differential operator into a more suitable one. We will show that the modified definition is more convenient in studying the boundary value problems for Caputo-type fractional differential equations. As an application, after recalling some properties of the said (new) operator, we summarize our discussion by presenting an equivalence result for differential and integral problems for Caputo-type fractional derivatives and for the weak topology. In order to cover the full scope of this paper, we investigate the equivalence problem in case of multivalued fractional problems.","Mieczysław Cichoń

2289,How to adaptively resolve evolutionary singularities in differential equations with symmetry,"Many time-dependent partial differential equations have solutions which evolve to have features with small length scales. Examples are blow-up singularities and interfaces. To compute such features accurately it is essential to use some form of adaptive method which resolves fine length and time scales without being prohibitively expensive to implement. In this paper we will describe an r-adaptive method (based on moving mesh partial differential equations) which moves mesh points into regions where the solution is developing singular behaviour. The method exploits natural symmetries which are often present in partial differential equations describing physical phenomena. These symmetries give an insight into the scalings (of solution, space and time) associated with a developing singularity, and guide the adaptive procedure. In this paper the theory behind these methods will be developed and then applied to a number of physical problems which have (blow-up type) singularities linked to symmetries of the underlying PDEs. The paper is meant to be a practical guide towards solving such problems adaptively and contains an example of a Matlab code for resolving the singular behaviour of the semi-linear heat equation.",C.

2290,Differential-operator representations of Weyl group and singular vectors in Verma modules,"Given a suitable ordering of the positive root system associated with a semisimple Lie algebra, there exists a natural correspondence between Verma modules and related polynomial algebras. With this, the Lie algebra action on a Verma module can be interpreted as a differential operator action on polynomials, and thus on the corresponding truncated formal power series. We prove that the space of truncated formal power series gives a differential-operator representation of the Weyl group W. We also introduce a system of partial differential equations to investigate singular vectors in the Verma module. It is shown that the solution space of the system in the space of truncated formal power series is the span of {w(1) | w ∈ W}. Those w(1) that are polynomials correspond to singular vectors in the Verma module. This elementary approach by partial differential equations also gives a new proof of the well-known BGG-Verma theorem.",Wei Xiao,Science China Mathematics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-016-9101-y,"Verma module,singular vector,differential equation,differential operator,Weyl group"

To accomplish this aim, the micropolar theory is combined with the nonlocal elasticity. To consider the nonlocality, both integral (original) and differential formulations of Eringen's nonlocal theory are considered. The beams are considered to be Timoshenko-type, and the governing equations are derived in the variational form through Hamilton's principle. The relations are written in an appropriate matrix-vector representation that can be readily utilized in numerical approaches. A finite element (FE) approach is also proposed for the solution procedure. Parametric studies are conducted to show the simultaneous nonlocal and micropolar effects on the bending response of small-scale beams under different boundary conditions.","M. Faraji-Oskouie1, A.

The solution of the problem, being contaminated by a small perturbation parameter, exhibits layer behavior. There exist narrow regions, in the neighborhood of outflow boundary, where the solution has steep gradient. The presence of parasitic parameters, perturbation parameter and time delay, is often the source for the increased order and stiffness of these systems. The stiffness, attributed to the simultaneous occurrence of slow and fast phenomena and on their dependence on the past history of the physical systems. A numerical method based on standard finite difference operator is presented. The first step involves a discretization of time variable using backward Euler method. This results into a set of stationary singularly perturbed semi-discrete problems which are further discretized in space using standard finite difference operators.

This is related to results on the dihedral angles of ideal or hyperideal hyperbolic polyhedra. The results presented here extend those in Schlenker (Math. Res. Lett.
12(1), 82–112, [2005]), however, the proof is completely different (and more intricate) since Schlenker (Math. Res. Lett.
12(1), 82–112, [2005]) used a shortcut which is not available here.

We also give optimal conditions for the regularity of the manifoldsgraph Φ andgraph ψ, and optimal conditions for the regularity of the leaves of two foliations of the phase space associated to the uncoupling.

2327,Numerical Blow-Up of Nonlinear Parabolic Integro-Differential Equations on Unbounded Domain,"The efficient numerical methods of the nonlinear parabolic integro-differential PDEs on unbounded spatial domains whose solutions blow up in finite time are considered. Based on the unified approach proposed in Zhang et al. (Phys Rev E 78:026709, 2008), Zhang et al. (Phys Rev E 79:046711, 2009), the nonlinear absorbing boundary conditions for one-dimensional and two-dimensional nonlinear parabolic integro-differential PDEs are derived. Thus the original problem on the unbounded spatial domain is reduced to an initial-boundary-value (IBV) problem on a bounded computational domain. Secondly, a simple but efficient adaptive time-stepping scheme for the reduced IBV problem is achieved by using the fixed point method to make the finite difference approximation stable at each time level. At each time level, we also prove that the lower bound and upper bound of the blow-up time can be bounded by the numerical blow-up times of the forward and backward Euler schemes. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated by a broad range of numerical examples, including a problem with a circle line blow-up.","Hermann Brunner1,2, Tao Tang3 & Jiwei Zhang",Journal of Scientific Computing,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-016-0179-8,"Nonlinear parabolic integro-differential PDEs,Unbounded spatial domains,Unified approach,Finite time blow-up,Nonlinear absorbing boundary conditions,Adaptive time-stepping"
2328,Construction of minimal cocycles arising from specific differential equations,"Blending methods of Topological Dynamics and Control Theory, we develop a new technique to construct compact-Lie-group-valued minimal cocycles arising as fundamental matrix solutions of linear differential equations with recurrent coefficients subject to a given constraint. The precise requirement on the coefficients is that they belong to a specified closed convex subsetS of the Lie algebraL of the Lie group. Our result is proved for a very thin class of cocycles, since the dimension ofS is allowed to be much smaller than that ofL, and the only assumption onS is thatL
0(S) =L, whereL
0(S) is the ideal ofL(S) generated by the difference setS − S, andL(S) is the Lie subalgebra ofL generated byS.

2329,Deterministic and stochastic differential inclusions with multiple surfaces of discontinuity,"We consider a class of deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems with discontinuous drift f and solutions that are constrained to live in a given closed domain G in \({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\) according to a constraint vector field D(·) specified on the boundary \(\partial G\) of the domain. Specifically, we consider equations of the form \(\phi = \theta + \eta + u , \quad \dot{\theta}(t) \in F(\phi(t)), \quad \mbox{a.e. } t\) for u in an appropriate class of functions, where η is the “constraining term” in the Skorokhod problem specified by (G, D) and F is the set-valued upper semicontinuous envelope of f. The case \(G ={\mathbb{R}}^{n}\) (when there is no constraining mechanism) and u is absolutely continuous corresponds to the well known setting of differential inclusions (DI). We provide a general sufficient condition for uniqueness of solutions and Lipschitz continuity of the solution map, in the form of existence of a Lyapunov set. Here we assume (i) G is convex and admits the representation \(G=\cup_i\overline{C_i}\) , where \(\{C_i,i\in {\mathbb{I}}\}\) is a finite collection of disjoint, open, convex, polyhedral cones in \({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\) , each having its vertex at the origin; (ii) f =  b +  f
c is a vector field defined on G such that b assumes a constant value on each of the given cones and f
c is Lipschitz continuous on G; and (iii) D is an upper semicontinuous, cone-valued vector field that is constant on each face of ∂G. We also provide existence results under much weaker conditions (where no Lyapunov set condition is imposed). For stochastic differential equations (SDE) (possibly, reflected) that have drift coefficient f and a Lipschitz continuous (possibly degenerate) diffusion coefficient, we establish strong existence and pathwise uniqueness under appropriate conditions. Our approach yields new existence and uniqueness results for both DI and SDE even in the case \(G = {\mathbb{R}}^{n}.\) The work has applications in the study of scaling limits of stochastic networks.","Rami Atar1, Amarjit Budhiraja2 & Kavita Ramanan",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-007-0104-z,"Discontinous drift,Ordinary differential equations,Differential inclusions,Stochastic differential equations,Stochastic differential inclusions,Reflected diffusions,Skorokhod map,Skorokhod problem"
2330,Microlocal analysis of asymptotically hyperbolic and Kerr-de Sitter spaces (with an appendix by Semyon Dyatlov),"In this paper we develop a general, systematic, microlocal framework for the Fredholm analysis of non-elliptic problems, including high energy (or semiclassical) estimates, which is stable under perturbations. This framework, described in Sect. 2, resides on a compact manifold without boundary, hence in the standard setting of microlocal analysis.Many natural applications arise in the setting of non-Riemannian b-metrics in the context of Melrose’s b-structures. These include asymptotically de Sitter-type metrics on a blow-up of the natural compactification, Kerr-de Sitter-type metrics, as well as asymptotically Minkowski metrics.The simplest application is a new approach to analysis on Riemannian or Lorentzian (or indeed, possibly of other signature) conformally compact spaces (such as asymptotically hyperbolic or de Sitter spaces), including a new construction of the meromorphic extension of the resolvent of the Laplacian in the Riemannian case, as well as high energy estimates for the spectral parameter in strips of the complex plane. These results are also available in a follow-up paper which is more expository in nature (Vasy in Uhlmann, G. (ed.) Inverse Problems and Applications.

N-soliton solutions, Bäcklund transformation and conservation laws for the integro-differential nonlinear Schröbinger equation from the isotropic inhomogeneous Heisenberg spin magnetic chain","Under investigation in this paper is an integro-differential nonlinear Schröbinger (IDNLS) equation, which is equivalent to the spin evolution equation of a classical in-homogeneous Heisenberg magnetic chain in the continuum limit. Based on the Hirota method, the bilinear form and N-soliton solution for the IDNLS equation are derived with the help of symbolic computation. Moreover, N-soliton solution for the IDNLS equation is expressed in terms of the double Wronskian and testified through the direct substitution into the bilinear form. Besides, the bilinear Bäcklund transformation and infinitely many conservation laws are also obtained for the IDNLS equation. Propagation characteristics and interaction behaviors of the solitons are discussed by analysis of such physical quantities as the soliton amplitude, width, velocity and initial phase. Interactions of the solitons are proved to be elastic through the asymptotic analysis. Effect of inhomogeneity on the interaction of the solitons is studied graphically.","Pan Wang1, Bo Tian1, Wen-Jun Liu1 & …Kun Sun",Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0965542514040125,"integro-differential nonlinear Schröbinger equation,inhomogeneous Heisenberg magnetic chain,soliton solutions,double Wronskian,Hirota method,Bäcklund transformation,infinitely many conservation laws,symbolic computation"

It is assumed that player E (the evader) has complete observation of the position and velocity of player P, whereas player P (the pursuer) can measure the distanced (P, E) between P and E but receives noise-corrupted measurements of the bearing β of E from P. Three cases are dealt with: (a) using the noise-corrupted measurements of β, player P applies the proportional navigation guidance law; (b) P has complete observation ofd (P, E) and β (this case is treated for the sake of completeness); (c) using the noise-corrupted measurements of β, P applies an erroneous line-of sight guidance law. For each of the cases, sufficient conditions on optimal strategies are derived. In each of the cases, these conditions require the solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation on a in ℝ2.

a heterogeneous medium on the propagation of an elastic stress field through it. The generalized
derivative serves as the mathematical concept displaying the microstructure of a heterogeneous
system. Using the generalized derivative we modify the operator in the initial model of linear
elasticity. The Green’s function (built on the operator) displays the microstructural features of the
system. We use the method of conditional moments to obtain the effective coefficients of elasticity
which are included in the averaged equations and describing the elastic properties of
a heterogeneous medium. This approach leads to the integrals containing the modified averaged
Green’s function and the correlation function of the structure geometry. Using these terms, we
integrally take into account the microstructure of the system in the final effective elasticity
coefficients.

2350,On the Suicidal Pedestrian Differential Game,"We consider the following differential game of pursuit and evasion involving two participating players: an evader, which has limited maneuverability, and an agile pursuer. The agents move on the Euclidean plane with different but constant speeds. Whereas the pursuer can change the orientation of its velocity vector arbitrarily fast, that is, he is a “pedestrian” á la Isaacs, the evader cannot make turns having a radius smaller than a specified minimum turning radius. This problem can be seen as a reversed Homicidal Chauffeur game, hence the name “Suicidal Pedestrian Differential Game.” The aim of this paper is to derive the optimal strategies of the two players and characterize the initial conditions that lead to capture if the pursuer acts optimally, and areas that guarantee evasion regardless of the pursuer’s strategy. Both proximity-capture and point-capture are considered. After applying the optimal strategy for the evader, it is shown that the case of point-capture reduces to a special version of Zermelo’s Navigation Problem (ZNP) for the pursuer. Therefore, the well-known ZNP solution can be used to validate the results obtained through the differential game framework, as well as to characterize the time-optimal trajectories. The results are directly applicable to collision avoidance in maritime and Air Traffic Control applications.","Ioannis Exarchos1, Panagiotis Tsiotras1 & Meir Pachter",Dynamic Games and Applications,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13235-014-0130-2,"Pursuit–evasion,Game of two cars,Zermelo’s navigation problem"

2354,Needle Variations and Almost Lower Semicontinuous Differential Inclusions,"It is shown that the construction of needle variations can be carried out for almost lower semicontinuous differential inclusions rather than for the case of ordinary single-valued continuously differentiable vector fields usually considered in the literature. The construction leads to needle variations whose flows are in general set-valued but still have good differentiability properties. The variations are constructed by using single-valued selections that are not necessarily continuous with respect to the state variable, but have instead a much weaker 'integral continuity' property, somewhat more general that the 'directional continuity' considered in previous work by A. Cambini and S. Querci, A. Pucci, and A. Bressan. The existence of many such selections is proved by slightly adapting an argument due to Bressan, extending it from the lower semicontinuous to the almost lower semicontinuous case, and strengthening it to yield not only directional continuity at all points but also full continuity at a specified point.",Héctor J.

One of the evaluation methods under risk and uncertainty conditions is using geometric Brownian motion random differential equation and simulation by Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods as applied in this study. In Monte Carlo method, pseudo-random sequences are used to generate pseudo-random numbers, but in quasi-Monte Carlo method, quasi-random sequences are used with better uniformity and more rapid convergence compared with pseudo-random sequences. The predictions of total stock index and value at risk by this method are better and more exact than Monte Carlo method.

2360,Robust Policies for a Multiple-Pursuer Single-Evader Differential Game,"Analysis of the pursuit–evasion differential game consisting of multiple pursuers and single evader with simple motion is difficult due to the well-known curse of dimensionality. Policies have been proposed for this scenario, and we show that these policies are global Stackelberg equilibrium strategies. However, we also show that they are not saddle-point equilibria in the feedback sense. The argument is twofold: cases where the saddle-point condition is violated and cases where the strategy profiles are not time consistent (subgame perfect). The issue of capturability is explored, and sufficient conditions for guaranteed capture are provided. A new pursuit policy is proposed which guarantees capture while also providing an upper bound for capture time. The evader policy corresponding to the global Stackelberg equilibrium is shown to provide a lower bound for capture time. Thus, these policies are robust from the pursuer and evader perspectives, respectively, should they implement them. Several other interesting pursuit and evasion policies are explored and compared with the robust policies in a series of experiments.","Alexander Von Moll

The boundary conditions following Thom’s formula, Jenison’s formula of second and third order and computational boundary method are applied to solve the coupled equations. The geometry for the problem is a lid-driven cavity in which the coupled differential equations are solved. The order of accuracy of the boundary conditions affects largely the value of vorticity values at the centre of the primary vortex. At lower Reynolds number these values don’t have any impact; however at large Reynolds numbers those values are affected by large amount. Sometimes the computed values overshot the theoretical value of vorticity i.e. − 1.88596 with increase of Reynolds number. For this computation the grid meshes 129 × 129 and 257 × 257 are used.

Abstract. Using the dynamic programming principle in optimal stopping theory, we derive a semilinear Black and Scholes type partial differential equation set in a fixed domain for the value of an American (call/put) option. The nonlinearity in the semilinear Black and Scholes equation depends discontinuously on the American option value, so that standard theory for partial differential equation does not apply. In fact, it is not clear what one should mean by a solution to the semilinear Black and Scholes equation. Guided by the dynamic programming principle, we suggest an appropriate definition of a viscosity solution. Our main results imply that there exists exactly one such viscosity solution of the semilinear Black and Scholes equation, namely the American option value. In other words, we provide herein a new formulation of the American option valuation problem. Our formulation constitutes a starting point for designing and analyzing “easy to implement” numerical algorithms for computing the value of an American option. The numerical aspects of the semilinear Black and Scholes equation are addressed in [7].","Fred E. Benth1, Kenneth H.

2392,A Differential Equation Model of Collagen Accumulation in a Healing Wound,"Wound healing is a complex biological process which involves many cell types and biochemical signals and which progresses through multiple, overlapping phases. In this manuscript, we develop a model of collagen accumulation as a marker of wound healing. The mathematical model is a system of ordinary differential equations which tracks fibroblasts, collagen, inflammation and pathogens. The model was validated by comparison to the normal time course of wound healing where appropriate activity for the inflammatory, proliferative and remodeling phases was recorded. Further validation was made by comparison to collagen accumulation experiments by Madden and Peacock (Ann. Surg. 174(3):511–520, 1971). The model was then used to investigate the impact of local oxygen levels on wound healing. Finally, we present a comparison of two wound healing therapies, antibiotics and increased fibroblast proliferation. This model is a step in developing a comprehensive model of wound healing which can be used to develop and test new therapeutic treatments.","Rebecca A. Segal1,2, Robert F. Diegelmann2,3,4, Kevin R.

The authors first prove a sufficient condition for the existence of a bound on the degree of the possible polynomial solutions to an AODE. An AODE satisfying this condition is called noncritical. Then the authors prove that some common classes of low-order AODEs are noncritical. For rational solutions, the authors determine a class of AODEs, which are called maximally comparable, such that the possible poles of any rational solutions are recognizable from their coefficients. This generalizes the well-known fact that any pole of rational solutions to a linear ODE is contained in the set of zeros of its leading coefficient. Finally, the authors develop an algorithm to compute all rational solutions of certain maximally comparable AODEs, which is applicable to 78.54% of the AODEs in Kamke’s collection of standard differential equations.","Thieu N.

An investigation of the differential aspects of the linear isobole relation may cast some light in this regard. By conceptual extension of the present single effect level (i.e. effect-point) relation of the linear isobole to an effect-neighbourhood relation in which the linear isobole holds over a small continuous range of effect levels, the mathematical differential of the linear isobole can be developed and investigated. This differential aspect provides some useful insights into the implication and interpretation of the linear isobole relation when used as a general criterion in agent interaction studies. it can also serve as the mathematical basis for the formulation of analytic schemes in which the linear isobole relation is applicable over a continuous range of effect levels.",Gabriel K.

If f(t) isa.a. from R into X, a uniformly convex space, then\(F(t) = \int\limits_{t_0 }^t {f(s)ds} \) isa.a. if and only if it is bounded on (− ∞, ∞).


2)

3)
X is any B-space. G(t) a one parameter strongly continuous group such that\(\mathop {\sup }\limits_{ - \infty< t< \infty } \) ∥G(t)∥ < ∞. If S={f(t): t rational} isa.a. under G(t) and f(t) isa.a. then G(t)f(t): R→X isa.a.

Incomplete nested dissection and domain decomposition are used to distribute the domain among the processors and to organize the matrix into sections in which pivoting is applied to stabilize the factorization of indefinite equation sets. The algorithm is highly parallel and memory efficient; the efficient use of sparsity in the matrix allows the solution of larger problems as the number of processors is increased, and minimizes computations as well as the number and volume of communications among the processors. The number of messages and the total volume of messages passed during factorization, which are used as measures of algorithm efficiency, are reduced significantly compared to other algorithms. Factorization times are low and speedups high for implementation on an Intel iPSC/860 hypercube computer.

2416,Some fundamental qualifications of optimal strategies and transition surfaces in differential games,"At each point of a regular region of a differential game, there are two tangent cones which are complementary to each other. The two vectograms defined by the pair of pure optimal strategies must be contained separately in the two tangent cones. The velocity vector resulting from the selection of the optimal strategies consequently must represent a semipermeable direction. These conditions, which reveal a fundamental separating property of the optimal velocity vector, are weaker than that of Isaac's main equation. Moreover they hold even on singular surfaces in the regular regions. The conditions also reveal a necessary condition for a differential game to have a regular region. Each isovalued surface in the regular region is essentially a semipermeable surface. A transition surface arises only when the resulting directed isovalued surface of the previous optimal strategies cannot have a smooth semipermeable extension at the singular surface. This observation yields a necessary condition for a transition surface to occur. The localization of transition surfaces is then possible. Finally, a jump and smooth condition of the isovalued surfaces is given.",P. L.

2424,Free vibration analysis of functionally graded beams with non-uniform cross-section using the differential transform method,"Free vibrations of non-uniform cross-section and axially functionally graded Euler–Bernoulli beams with various boundary conditions were studied using the differential transform method. The method was applied to a variety of beam configurations that are either axially non-homogeneous or geometrically non-uniform along the beam length or both. The governing equation of an Euler–Bernoulli beam with variable coefficients was reduced to a set of simpler algebraic recurrent equations by means of the differential transformations. Then, transverse natural frequencies were determined by requiring the non-trivial solution of the eigenvalue problem stated for a transformed function of the transverse displacement with appropriately transformed its high derivatives and boundary conditions. To show the generality and effectiveness of this approach, natural frequencies of various beams with variable profiles of cross-section and functionally graded non-homogeneity were calculated and compared with analytical and numerical results available in the literature. The benefit of the differential transform method to solve eigenvalue problems for beams with arbitrary axial geometrical non-uniformities and axial material gradient profiles is clearly demonstrated.","Davit Ghazaryan1,3, Vyacheslav N.

2441,Generators and Defining Relations for the Ring of Differential Operators on a Smooth Affine Algebraic Variety,"For the ring of differential operators on a smooth affine algebraic variety X over a field of characteristic zero a finite set of algebra generators and a finite set of defining relations are found explicitly. As a consequence, a finite set of generators and a finite set of defining relations are given for the module \({\rm Der}_K({\cal O} (X))\) of derivations on the algebra \({\cal O} (X)\) of regular functions on the variety X. For the variety X which is not necessarily smooth, a set of natural derivations \({\rm der}_K({\cal O} (X))\) of the algebra \({\cal O} (X)\) and a ring \(\mathfrak{D} ({\cal O} (X))\) of natural differential operators on \({\cal O} (X)\) are introduced. The algebra \(\mathfrak{D} ({\cal O} (X))\) is a Noetherian algebra of Gelfand–Kirillov dimension 2dim (X). When X is smooth then \({\rm der}_K({\cal O} (X))={\rm Der}_K({\cal O} (X))\) and \(\mathfrak{D} ({\cal O} (X))={\cal D} ({\cal O} (X))\). A criterion of smoothness of X is given when X is irreducible (X is smooth iff \(\mathfrak{D} ({\cal O} (X))\) is a simple algebra iff \({\cal O} (X)\) is a simple \(\mathfrak{D} ({\cal O} (X))\)-module). The same results are true for regular algebras of essentially finite type. For a singular irreducible affine algebraic variety X, in general, the algebra of differential operators \({\cal D} ({\cal O} (X))\) needs not be finitely generated nor (left or right) Noetherian, it is proved that each term \({\cal D} ({\cal O} (X))_i\) of the order filtration \({\cal D} ({\cal O} (X))=\cup_{i\geq 0}{\cal D} ({\cal O} (X))_i\) is a finitely generated left \({\cal O} (X)\)-module.",V.

2443,Differential Games with Asymmetric and Correlated Information,"Differential games with asymmetric information were introduced by Cardaliaguet (SIAM J Control Optim 46:816–838, 2007). As in repeated games with lack of information on both sides (Aumann and Maschler in Repeated games with incomplete information, with the collaboration of R. Stearns, 1995), each player receives a private signal (his type) before the game starts and has a prior belief about his opponent’s type. Then, a differential game is played in which the dynamic and the payoff functions depend on both types: each player is thus partially informed about the differential game that is played. The existence of the value function and some characterizations have been obtained under the assumption that the signals are drawn independently. In this paper, we drop this assumption and extend these results to the general case of correlated types. As an application, we provide a new characterization of the asymptotic value of repeated games with incomplete information on both sides, as the unique dual solution of a Hamilton–Jacobi equation.",Miquel Oliu-Barton,Dynamic Games and Applications,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13235-014-0131-1,"Differential games,Fenchel duality,Incomplete information,Comparison principle,Value function,Viscosity solutions"

The ring of meromorphic functions in system variables is constructed under the assumption that the system is submersive, and equipped with three operators (delta- and nabla-derivatives, and the forward shift operator) whose properties are studied. The formalism developed unifies the existing theories for continuous- and discrete-time nonlinear systems, and accommodates also the case of non-uniformly sampled systems. Compared with the homogeneous case the main difficulties are noncommutativity of delta (nabla) derivative and shift operators and the fact that the additional time variable t appears in the definition of the differential ring. The latter yields that the new variables of the inversive closure, depending on t, have to be chosen to be smooth at each dense point t of the time scale.","Zbigniew Bartosiewicz1, Ülle Kotta2, Ewa Pawłuszewicz3 & …Małgorzata Wyrwas","Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems",2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00498-011-0058-7,"Time scale,Nonlinear system,Differential ring,Inversive closure"

2453,A Geometric Theory of Nonlinear Morphoelastic Shells,"Many thin three-dimensional elastic bodies can be reduced to elastic shells: two-dimensional elastic bodies whose reference shape is not necessarily flat. More generally, morphoelastic shells are elastic shells that can remodel and grow in time. These idealized objects are suitable models for many physical, engineering, and biological systems. Here, we formulate a general geometric theory of nonlinear morphoelastic shells that describes both the evolution of the body shape, viewed as an orientable surface, as well as its intrinsic material properties such as its reference curvatures. In this geometric theory, bulk growth is modeled using an evolving referential configuration for the shell, the so-called material manifold. Geometric quantities attached to the surface, such as the first and second fundamental forms, are obtained from the metric of the three-dimensional body and its evolution. The governing dynamical equations for the body are obtained from variational consideration by assuming that both fundamental forms on the material manifold are dynamical variables in a Lagrangian field theory. In the case where growth can be modeled by a Rayleigh potential, we also obtain the governing equations for growth in the form of kinetic equations coupling the evolution of the first and the second fundamental forms with the state of stress of the shell. We apply these ideas to obtain stress-free growth fields of a planar sheet, the time evolution of a morphoelastic circular cylindrical shell subject to time-dependent internal pressure, and the residual stress of a morphoelastic planar circular shell.","Souhayl Sadik1, Arzhang Angoshtari2, Alain Goriely3 & …Arash Yavari1,",Journal of Nonlinear Science,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00332-016-9294-9,"Bulk growth,Morphoelasticity,Shell,Nonlinear elasticity,Geometric mechanics,Residual stress"

Second, we demonstrate how these methods can be used to obtain insight into complex biological regulatory systems in which interactions occur with time delays: for this, we consider a system of two equations for the plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in a diabetic patient subject to a system of external assistance. The model has two delays: the technological delay of the external system, and the physiological delay of the patient's liver. We compute stability of the steady state solution as a function of two parameters, compare with analytical results and compute several branches of periodic solutions and their stability. These numerical results allow to infer two categories of diabetic patients for which the external system has different efficiency.","K. Engelborghs1, V. Lemaire2, J. Bélair3 & …D.

In the numerical analysis, unknown displacement discontinuities are approximated with the products of the fundamental density functions and power series. The fundamental functions are chosen to express a two-dimensional interface crack rigorously.

2470,"Eigenvalues and delay differential equations: periodic coefficients, impulses and rigorous numerics","We develop validated numerical methods for the computation of Floquet multipliers of equilibria and periodic solutions of delay differential equations, as well as impulsive delay differential equations. Using our methods, one can rigorously count the number of Floquet multipliers outside a closed disc centered at zero or the number of multipliers contained in a compact set bounded away from zero. We consider systems with a single delay where the period is at most equal to the delay, and the latter two are commensurate. We first represent the monodromy operator (period map) as an operator acting on a product of sequence spaces that represent the Chebyshev coefficients of the state-space vectors. Truncation of the number of modes yields the numerical method, and by carefully bounding the truncation error in addition to some other technical operator norms, this leads to the method being suitable to computer-assisted proofs of Floquet multiplier location. We demonstrate the computer-assisted proofs on two example problems. We also test our discretization scheme in floating point arithmetic on a gamut of randomly-generated high-dimensional examples with both periodic and constant coefficients to inspect the precision of the spectral radius estimation of the monodromy operator (i.e. stability/instability check for periodic systems) for increasing numbers of Chebyshev modes.","Kevin E.

We develop a dynamic mathematical model, based on differential assimilation, that controls the C: N and C: P ratios in a herbivore within given tolerance ranges; the actual mathematical mechanism is to define the absorption coefficients to be dependent on these elemental ratios. The model inputs variable, time-dependent food and grazing rates and calculates the net dynamic consumer production (growth) of C, N, and P. It shows that total growth is equally sensitive to variations in both food quality and in assimilation rates, and it shows quantitatively how C-, N-, or P-limited growth could occur at different periods during the development period. The analysis generalizes earlier work limited to just two elements.","J.

2495,Solving Quadratically Constrained Least Squares Problems Using a Differential-Geometric Approach,"A quadratically constrained linear least squares problem is usually solved using a Lagrange multiplier for the constraint and then solving iteratively a nonlinear secular equation for the optimal Lagrange multiplier. It is well-known that, due to the closeness to a pole for the secular equation, standard methods for solving the secular equation can be slow, and sometimes it is not easy to select a good starting value for the iteration. The problem can be reformulated as that of minimizing the residual of the least squares problem on the unit sphere. Using a differential-geometric approach we formulate Newton's method on the sphere, and thereby avoid the difficulties associated with the Lagrange multiplier formulation. This Newton method on the sphere can be implemented efficiently, and since it is easy to find a good starting value for the iteration, and the convergence is often quite fast, it has a clear advantage over the Lagrange multiplier method. A numerical example is given.",Lars Eldèn,BIT Numerical Mathematics,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1021998908811,"Ill-conditioned,Lagrange multiplier,least squares,Newton's method,quadratic constraint,Stiefel manifold"
2496,Continuous and Smooth Envelopes of Topological Algebras. Part 2,"Since the first optical instruments were invented, the idea that the visible image of an object under observation depends on tools of observation became commonly assumed in physics. A way of formalizing this idea in mathematics is the construction that assigns to an arbitrary object A in a category K its envelope \( {\mathrm{Env}}_{\varPhi}^{\varOmega}\kern0.5em A \) in a given class of morphisms (a class of representations) Ω with respect to a given class of morphisms (a class of observation tools) Φ. It turns out that if we take a sufficiently wide category of topological algebras as K, then each choice of the classes Ω and Φ defines a “projection of functional analysis into geometry,” and the standard “geometric disciplines,” like complex geometry, differential geometry, and topology, become special cases of this construction. This gives a formal scheme of “categorical construction of geometries” with many interesting applications, in particular, “geometric generalizations of the Pontryagin duality” (to the classes of noncommutative groups). In this paper we describe this scheme in topology and in differential geometry.",S. S.

Together with different nutrient uptake rates inside and outside the tumor, this introduces variability in spatial diffusion gradients. Linear stability analysis suggests that the uptake rate in the tumor microenvironment, together with chemotaxis, may induce unstable growth, especially when the nutrient gradients are large. We investigate the fully nonlinear dynamics using a spectrally accurate boundary integral method. Our nonlinear simulations reveal that vascular heterogeneity plays an important role in the development of morphological instabilities that range from fingering and chain-like morphologies to compact, plate-like shapes in two dimensions.","Min-Jhe Lu1, Chun Liu1, John Lowengrub2 & …Shuwang Li

2509,On homogenization of stokes flow in slowly varying media with applications to fluid–structure interaction,"In this paper we establish corrector estimates for Stokes flow in slowly varying perforated media via two scale asymptotic analysis. Current methods and techniques are often not able to deal with changing geometries prevalent in applied problems. For example, in a deformable porous medium environment, the geometry does not remain periodic under mechanical deformation and if slow variation in the geometry occurs. For such problems, one cannot use classical homogenization results directly and new homogenization results and estimates are needed. Our work uses asymptotic techniques of Marusic-Paloka and Mikelic (Bollettino U.M.I 7:661–671, 1996) where the authors constructed a downscaled velocity which converges to the fine-scale velocity at a rate of ε
1/6 where ε is the characteristic length scale. We assume a slowly varying porous medium and study homogenization and corrector estimates for the Stokes equations. Slowly varying media arise, e.g., in fluid–structure interaction (FSI) problems (Popov et al. in Iterative upscaling of flows in deformable porous media, 2008), carbonation of porous concrete (Peter in C. R. Mecanique 335:357–362, 2007a; C. R. Mecanique 335:679–684, 2007b), and various other multiphysics processes. To homogenize Stokes flows in such media we restate the cell problems of Marusic-Paloka and Mikelic (Bollettino U.M.I 7:661–671, 1996) in a moving RVE framework. Further, to recover the same convergence properties it is necessary to solve an additional cell problem and add one more corrector term to the downscaled velocity. We further extend the framework of Marusic-Paloka and Mikelic (Bollettino U.M.I 7:661–671, 1996) to three spatial dimensions in both periodic and variable pore-space cases. Next, we also propose an efficient algorithm for computing the correctors by solving a limited number of cell problems at selected spatial locations. We present two computational examples: one for a constructed medium of elliptical perforations, and another for a fractured medium with FSI driven deformation. We obtain numerical estimates that confirm the theory in these two examples.","Donald L.

We show that the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of an elliptic, q-convex Lie algebroid admits a Hodge decomposition in degree q. This generalizes the well-known Hodge decompositions for the exterior derivative on real manifolds and the delbar-operator on q-convex complex manifolds. We establish the results in a more general setting, where the differential does not necessarily square to zero and moreover varies in a family, including an analysis of the behaviour on the deformation parameter. As application we give a proof of a classical holomorphic tubular neighbourhood theorem (which implies the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem) based on the Moser trick, and we provide a finite-dimensionality result for certain holomorphic Poisson cohomology groups.","J.

Based on the exterior differential calculus, we define the exterior difference system on the hypercubic lattice.

A criterion for the continuity of the IDS at a prescribed energy is given along with examples of operators with both continuous and discontinuous IDS.Subsequently, alloy-type perturbations of the periodic operator are considered. The randomness may enter both via the potential and the metric. A Wegner estimate is proven which implies the continuity of the corresponding IDS. This gives an example of a discontinuous “periodic” IDS which is regularized by a random perturbation.","Daniel Lenz1, Norbert Peyerimhoff2, Olaf Post3 & …Ivan Veselić",Japanese Journal of Mathematics,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11537-008-0729-4,"integrated density of states,periodic and random operators,Schrödinger operators on manifolds,continuity properties"

2531,Geometric and algebraic structures associated with the channel quantization problem,"We consider the use of surfaces as topological spaces in order to provide an answer to the quantization problem of a discrete memoryless channel (DMC). The aim is to identify the geometric and algebraic properties of the surface associated with the embedding of such a DMC. The procedure is based on the following steps: knowing the complete bipartite graph associated with a given DMC: (1) to determine the minimum and the maximum genus of the corresponding surfaces in which the given graph is embedded; (2) knowing the genus, to specify the roots as the elements of a Farey sequence of a planar algebraic curve; (3) to determine the solutions of a second-order Fuchsian differential equation as the generators of the corresponding Fuchsian group. We consider the cases of the hypergeometric and Heun equations, with three and four regular singular points, respectively. By means of this procedure, the fundamental region associated with the Fuchsian group is identified and this is the region where the planar algebraic curve is uniformized. A generalization of the quantization problem related to an m-ary input n-ary output symmetric channel viewed as a complete bipartite graph \(K_{m,n}\), by use of the embedding of this channel in compact surfaces is straightforward.",Anderson Jose de Oliveira1 & Reginaldo Palazzo Jr.,Computational and Applied Mathematics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-017-0446-9,"Differential equations,Riemann surfaces,Fuchsian groups,Uniformization,Quantization"
2532,Quaternion methods and models of regular celestial mechanics and astrodynamics,"This paper is a review, which focuses on our work, while including an analysis of many works of other researchers in the field of quaternionic regularization. The regular quaternion models of celestial mechanics and astrodynamics in the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel (KS) variables and Euler (Rodrigues-Hamilton) parameters are analyzed. These models are derived by the quaternion methods of mechanics and are based on the differential equations of the perturbed spatial two-body problem and the perturbed spatial central motion of a point particle. This paper also covers some applications of these models. Stiefel and Scheifele are known to have doubted that quaternions and quaternion matrices can be used efficiently to regularize the equations of celestial mechanics. However, the author of this paper and other researchers refuted this point of view and showed that the quaternion approach actually leads to efficient solutions for regularizing the equations of celestial mechanics and astrodynamics.This paper presents convenient geometric and kinematic interpretations of the KS transformation and the KS bilinear relation proposed by the present author. More general (compared with the KS equations) quaternion regular equations of the perturbed spatial two-body problem in the KS variables are presented. These equations are derived with the assumption that the KS bilinear relation was not satisfied. The main stages of the quaternion theory of regularizing the vector differential equation of the perturbed central motion of a point particle are presented, together with regular equations in the KS variables and Euler parameters, derived by the aforementioned theory. We also present the derivation of regular quaternion equations of the perturbed spatial two-body problem in the Levi-Civita variables and the Euler parameters, developed by the ideal rectangular Hansen coordinates and the orientation quaternion of the ideal coordinate frame.This paper also gives new results using quaternionic methods in the perturbed spatial restricted three-body problem.",Y.

2537,Homogeneous spaces with inner metric and with integrable invariant distributions,"This paper is a survey of results (partly obtained by the authors) on homogeneous spaces of Lie groups \(G\) with a compact stabilizer subgroup \(H\), on which every \(G\)-invariant distribution is integrable. It is proved that the condition of integrability is necessary and sufficient for every invariant inner metric to be (holonomic) Finsler on such a space. As a corollary of the obtained results, we assert that the class of homogeneous spaces with invariant non-holonomic Riemannian metrics (in other terms, sub-Riemannian or Carnot–Carathéodory metrics), which were actively studied last 3 decades after Gromov’s work, is rather broad. On the other hand, the class of homogeneous spaces with integrable invariant distributions includes Cartan’s symmetric spaces as well as isotropy irreducible, in particular, strictly isotropy irreducible, homogeneous spaces, which have been classified in simply connected case in the papers by Wang and Ziller (respectively, by Manturov, Wolf and Krämer). Special attention is paid to the case, when the Lie groups \(G\) and \(H\) are connected. Then the integrability condition of the invariant distributions is equivalent to a purely algebraic condition, that for the Lie algebra \(h\) of the subgroup \(H\), any \(ad(h)\)-invariant vector subspace in the Lie algebra \(g\) of the Lie group \(G\) is a Lie subalgebra; such Lie subalgebra \(h\subset g\) is called a strong subalgebra. The first author proved that a simply connected and compact space \(G/H\) with this condition is isomorphic to a direct product of strictly isotropy irreducible homogeneous spaces. In line with this, the second author recently found several non-compact simply connected homogeneous spaces with this condition, which are not isomorphic to such direct products. These results are naturally related to the structure questions of a class of general homogeneous locally compact spaces with an inner metric. This class is exactly the closure in the Gromov–Hausdorff sense of the class of homogeneous manifolds with an inner metric. Any such manifold is isometric to some homogeneous manifold \(G/H\) with \(G\)-invariant (may be, non-holonomic) Finsler metric. The authors give fairly detailed survey of the existing methods of the search of geodesics, i.e., locally shortest arcs, on such manifolds (particularly, with invariant non-holonomic Riemannian metrics), non-holonomic metric geometry and its relations with the geometric group theory, \(CR\)-manifolds, thermodynamics, etc. Some unsolved problems are suggested.",V.

In this paper, we generalize the covariant derivative of Broojerdian et al. (Iran J Math Sci Inform 6(1):79–96, 2011) and construct covariant derivatives along MVFs which are not induced by affine connections on TM. We call this more general class of covariant derivatives higher affine connections. In addition, we also propose a framework which gives rise to non-induced higher connections; this framework is obtained by equipping the full exterior bundle \({\wedge^\bullet TM}\) with an associative bilinear form \({\eta}\). Since the latter can be shown to be equivalent to a set of differential forms of various degrees, this framework also provides a link between higher connections and multisymplectic geometry.",David N.

We define via a duality relation a vector Z (which depends on b) of square integrable stochastic processes which is shown to coincide with the unique strong solution of the previously mentioned equation. We show that the process Z is well defined independently of the boundedness of b and that it makes sense under the more general Novikov condition, which is known to guarantee only the existence of a weak solution. We then prove that under this mild assumption the process Z solves in the strong sense a related stochastic differential inequality. This fact together with an additional assumption will provide a comparison result similar to well known theorems obtained in the presence of strong solutions. Our framework is also suitable to treat path-dependent stochastic differential equations and an application to the famous Tsirelson equation is presented.",Alberto Lanconelli,Potential Analysis,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11118-014-9413-x,"Stochastic differential equations,Girsanov theorem,Novikov condition,Convex envelope,Comparison theorems"

In terms of the projective manifold \({\mathbb {P}}_{\mathbb {C}}\left( \mathfrak {Lie}(\mathcal{N})^*\right) \cong {\mathbb {P}}_3({\mathbb {C}})\), which is associated with the (2 + 1)-dimensional dual vector space \(\mathfrak {Lie}(\mathcal{N})^*\) of the real Heisenberg nilpotent Lie algebra \(\mathfrak {Lie}(\mathcal{N})\), the smooth line bundle technique of dynamic metaplectic spinor quantization leads to the twisted action of the metaplectic Lie group \(\mathrm{Mp}(2,{\mathbb {R}}) = \widetilde{\mathrm{Sp}}(2,{\mathbb {R}})\). The transitive proper hyperbolic-parabolically ruled gradient action of the projective Lorentz–Möbius Lie group \(\mathrm{PSO}(1,3,{\mathbb {R}})\) on \({\mathbb {P}}_{\mathbb {C}}\left( \mathfrak {Lie}(\mathcal{N})^*\right) \) torque-records dihedrally its spectral incidence projective curve, the plane cubic \(E({\mathbb {C}}) \hookrightarrow {\mathbb {P}}_2({\mathbb {C}}) \cong \mathrm{Sym}^2\left( {\mathbb {P}}_1({\mathbb {C}})\right) \), on the two-dimensional pages of the open-book foliation inside the very round sphere \({\mathbb {S}}_3 \cong \mathrm{Spin}(3,{\mathbb {R}}) \cong \mathrm{SU}(2,{\mathbb {C}}) \hookrightarrow {\mathbb {P}}_{\mathbb {C}}\left( \mathfrak {Lie}(\mathcal{N})^*\right) \) with angular momentum axis of the driving central universal Casimir metaplectic spinor. The projective correspondence for the spectral dual pair \(\left( \mathrm{Mp}(2,{\mathbb {R}}),\mathrm{PSO}(1,3,{\mathbb {R}})\right) \) provides an efficient mathematical approach to the high resolution imaging modalities of magnetic spin resonance tomography, optical or ocular coherence tomography of neuro-ophthalmology, spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, and the quantum field phenomena of the Hanbury Brown–Twiss experiment for photons and electrons. Due to the Eisenstein meromorphic calculus, the omni-directional interferometric detection of gravitational wavepackets of two polarizations is tomographically performed by the Abel–Jacobi inversion of the relativistic parabolic porism deviation of Kepplerian bifocal periodicity with its metaplectic spinor driven pair \((\sigma ,{\bar{\sigma }})\) of projective tangent involutions in the space \({\mathbb {P}}_{\mathbb {C}}\left( \mathfrak {Lie}(\mathcal{N})^*\right) \). The astrophysical emission of gravitational radiation is closely related to the concept of simply connected horned sphere which is homeomorphic to the compact base manifold of the Hopf principal circle bundle \({\mathbb {S}}_1 \hookrightarrow {\mathbb {S}}_3 {\mathop {\longrightarrow }\limits ^{\eta }} {\mathbb {S}}_2\). Riemann surface theory provides tomographic insight into the relativistic phenomenon of post-Kepplerian metaplectically driven spinor warping.",Walter J.

            ","In this paper, we study the computation of the sign of the determinant of a large matrix as a byproduct of the preconditioned GMRES method when applied to solve the linear systems arising in the discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs). Numerical experiments are presented where the technique is applied to detect and locate pitchfork and transcritical bifurcation points on a one parameter dependent system. With an appropriate selection of the initial guess in the GMRES method, the technique is shown to detect and accurately locate bifurcation points. We present an analysis that helps to explain the good performance observed in practice.

2560, Minimal surfaces: a geometric three dimensional segmentation approach," A novel geometric approach for three dimensional object segmentation is presented. The scheme is based on geometric deformable surfaces moving towards the objects to be detected. We show that this model is related to the computation of surfaces of minimal area (local minimal surfaces). The space where these surfaces are computed is induced from the three dimensional image in which the objects are to be detected. The general approach also shows the relation between classical deformable surfaces obtained via energy minimization and geometric ones derived from curvature flows in the surface evolution framework. The scheme is stable, robust, and automatically handles changes in the surface topology during the deformation. Results related to existence, uniqueness, stability, and correctness of the solution to this geometric deformable model are presented as well. Based on an efficient numerical algorithm for surface evolution, we present a number of examples of object detection in real and synthetic images.

2561,Discretization of asymptotic line parametrizations using hyperboloid surface patches,"Two-dimensional affine A-nets in \(3\)-space are quadrilateral meshes that discretize surfaces parametrized along asymptotic lines. The defining property of A-nets is planarity of vertex stars, hence elementary quadrilaterals of a generic A-net are skew. The present article deals with the extension of A-nets to differentiable surfaces, by gluing hyperboloid surface patches into the skew quadrilaterals. The obtained surfaces, named “hyperbolic nets”, are a novel, piecewise smooth discretization of surfaces parametrized along asymptotic lines. A simply connected affine A-net can be extended to a hyperbolic net if all quadrilateral strips are “equi-twisted”. The geometric condition of equi-twist implies the combinatorial property, that all inner vertices of the A-net have to be of even degree. If an A-net can be extended to a hyperbolic net, then there exists a 1-parameter family of such extensions. It is briefly explained how the generation of hyperbolic nets can be implemented on a computer. We use a projective model of Plücker line geometry in order to describe A-nets and hyperboloids.",Emanuel Huhnen-Venedey1 & Thilo Rörig,Geometriae Dedicata,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10711-013-9830-9,"Discrete differential geometry,Discrete asymptotic line parametrization,A-nets,Hyperboloids,Projective geometry,Plücker line geometry"

The fraction ring acts naturally on a new module of generalized functions. The latter includes an isomorphic copy of the differential algebra underlying the given ring of boundary problems. Our methodology employs noncommutative localization in the theory of integro-differential algebras and operators. The resulting structure allows to build a symbolic calculus in the style of Heaviside and Mikusiński, but with the added benefit of incorporating boundary conditions where the traditional calculi allow only initial conditions. Admissible boundary conditions include multiple evaluation points and nonlocal conditions. The operator ring is noncommutative, containing all integrators initialized at any evaluation point.",M.

2566,Graded algebras and their differential graded extensions,"In the survey, we deal with the following situation. Let A be a graded algebra or a differential graded algebra. Adjoining a set x of free (in any sense) indeterminates, we make a new differential graded algebra A〈x〉 by setting the differential values d: x → A on x. In the general case, such a construction is called the Shafarevich complex. Beginning with classical examples like the bar-complex, Koszul complex, and Tate resolution, we discuss noncommutative (and sometimes even nonassociative) versions of these notions. The comparison with the Koszul complex leads to noncommutative regular sequences and complete intersections; Tate’s process of killing cycles gives noncommutative DG resolutions and minimal models. The applications include the Golod-Shafarevich theorem, growth measures for graded algebras, characterizations of algebras of low homological dimension, and a homological description of Gröbner bases. The same constructions for categories of algebras with identities (like Lie or Jordan algebras) allow one to give a homological description of extensions and deformations of PI-algebras.",D.

We make use of the viewpoint introduced by Mackey and developed by Whitney in which currents are treated as chains instead of cochains. This approach gives our space and its topology an intrinsic geometric definition. Moreover, our sequence of norms gives fine control over convergence and compactness, providing viable alternatives to the weak and flat topologies on currents. Boundary is a continuous operator, as are operators that dualize to Hodge star, Lie derivative, pullback and interior product. Partitions of unity exist in this setting, and we are also able to define a Cartesian wedge product. We conclude with an application of this framework, generalizing the Reynolds’ Transport Theorem to nonsmooth domains.",J.

Developing the results of Kontsevich (Commun Math Phys 147:1–23, 1992) we evaluate the leading term of the symmetric polynomial counting the number of such “lattice” Jenkins–Strebel differentials having all zeroes on a single singular layer. This allows us to express the number of general “lattice” Jenkins–Strebel differentials as an appropriate weighted sum over decorated trees. The problem of counting Jenkins–Strebel differentials is equivalent to the problem of counting pillowcase covers, which serve as integer points in appropriate local coordinates on strata of moduli spaces of meromorphic quadratic differentials. This allows us to relate our counting problem to calculations of volumes of these strata . A very explicit expression for the volume of any stratum of meromorphic quadratic differentials recently obtained by the authors (Athreya et al. 2012) leads to an interesting combinatorial identity for our sums over trees.","Jayadev S.

2576,Theory of congruences and systems of conservation laws,"The authors of this work propose a new approach to systems of conservation laws which makes it possible to give new formulations for many concepts and constructions that appear here using the geometrical language of the theory of congruence. The following problems seems to us to be most interesting for further study.

1.
To give a description of systems ofn conservation laws of the Temple class, or, equivalently, ofn-parameter families of straight lines inA
n+1 all of whose developable surfaces are either plane or conic. The purely geometric classification of systems of two conservation laws of the Temple class is given in Sec. 5 and the results of Secs. 6 and 7 give us hope that an effective solution of this problem will be obtained in the more complicated casen≥3.


2.
To study the systems of conservation laws corresponding to certain projectively invariant classes ofn-parameter families of straight lines inA
n+1. Forn=2, this is nothing but the translation of theTheory of Congruences [11] into the language of systems of convervation laws.


3.
To continue the study of finite families of systems of hydrodynamic type that are closed with respect to the whole collection of Laplace transformations. Of special interest is the explicit construction of a nonlocal Hamiltonian formalism and the refinement of the generalized method of a hodograph.

2577,Equivariant normal forms for parameterized delay differential equations with applications to bifurcation theory,"In this paper, we develop an efficient approach to compute the equivariant normal form of delay differential equations with parameters in the presence of symmetry. We present and justify a process that involves center manifold reduction and normalization preserving the symmetry, and that yields normal forms explicitly in terms of the coefficients of the original system. We observe that the form of the reduced vector field relies only on the information of the linearized system at the critical point and on the inherent symmetry, and the normal forms give critical information about not only the existence but also the stability and direction of bifurcated spatiotemporal patterns. We illustrate our general results by some applications to fold bifurcation, equivariant Hopf bifurcation and Hopf-Hopf interaction, with a detailed case study of additive neurons with delayed feedback.","Shang Jiang Guo1, Yu Ming Chen2 & Jian Hong Wu","Acta Mathematica Sinica, English Series",2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10114-011-9718-2,"Equivariant delay differential equation,normal form,equilibrium,stability,bifurcation"

2581,Multiple separatrix crossing in multi-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian flows,"We study separatrix crossing in near-integrablek-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian flows, 2 <k < ∞, whose unperturbed phase portraits contain separatrices inn degrees of freedom, 1 <n <k. Each of the unperturbed separatrices can be recast as a codimension-one separatrix in the 2k-dimensional phase space, and the collection of these separatrices takes on a variety of geometrical possibilities in the reduced representation of a Poincaré section on the energy surface. In general 0 ≤l ≤n of the separatrices will be available to the Poincaré section, and each separatrix may be completely isolated from all other separatrices or intersect transversely with one or more of the other available separatrices. For completely isolated separatrices, transitions across broken separatrices are described for each separatrix by the single-separatrix crossing theory of Wiggins, as modified by Beigie. For intersecting separatrices, a possible violation of a normal hyperbolicity condition complicates the analysis by preventing the use of a persistence and smoothness theory for compact normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds and their local stable and unstable manifolds. For certain classes of multi-degree-of-freedom flows, however, a local persistence and smoothness result is straightforward, and we study the global implications of such a local result. In particular, we find codimension-one partial barriers and turnstile boundaries associated with each partially destroyed separatrix. From the collection of partial barriers and turnstiles follows a rich phase space partitioning and transport formalism to describe the dynamics amongst the various degrees of freedom. A generalization of Wiggins' higher-dimensional Melnikov theory to codimension-one surfaces in the multi-separatrix case allows one to uncover invariant manifold geometry. In the context of this perturbative analysis and detailed numerical computations, we study invariant manifold geometry, phase space partitioning, and phase space transport, with particular attention payed to the role of a vanishing frequency in the limit approaching the intersection of the partially destroyed separatrices. The class of flows under consideration includes flows of basic physical relevance, such as those describing scattering phenomena. The analysis is illustrated in the context of a detailed study of a 3-degree-of-freedom scattering problem.",D.

2582,"Interpolation and Sampling: E.T. Whittaker, K. Ogura and Their Followers","The classical sampling theorem has often been attributed to E.T. Whittaker, but this attribution is not strictly valid. One must carefully distinguish, for example, between the concepts of sampling and of interpolation, and we find that Whittaker worked in interpolation theory, not sampling theory. Again, it has been said that K. Ogura was the first to give a properly rigorous proof of the sampling theorem. We find that he only indicated where the method of proof could be found; we identify what is, in all probability, the proof he had in mind. Ogura states his sampling theorem as a “converse of Whittaker’s theorem”, but identifies an error in Whittaker’s work.In order to study these matters in detail we find it necessary to make a complete review of the famous 1915 paper of E.T. Whittaker, and two not so well known papers of Ogura dating from 1920. Since the life and work of Ogura is practically unknown outside Japan, and there he is usually regarded only as an educationalist, we present a detailed overview together with a list of some 70 papers of his which we had to compile. K. Ogura is presented in the setting of mathematics in Japan of the early 20th century.Finally, because many engineering textbooks refer to Whittaker as a source for the sampling theorem, we make a very brief review of some early introductions of sampling methods in the engineering context, mentioning H. Nyquist, K. Küpfmüller, V. Kotel’nikov, H. Raabe, C.E.

In the latter case, we describe residual effects of the full transformation group on the image invariants.

","In his 1910 “Five Variables” paper, Cartan solved the equivalence problem for the geometry of (2, 3, 5) distributions and in doing so demonstrated an intimate link between this geometry and the exceptional simple Lie groups of type \(\mathrm{G}_2\). He claimed to produce a local classification of all such (complex) distributions which have infinitesimal symmetry algebra of dimension at least 6 (and which satisfy a natural uniformity condition), but in 2013 Doubrov and Govorov showed that this classification misses a particular distribution \(\mathbf {E}\). We produce a closed form for the Fefferman–Graham ambient metric \({\smash {{\smash {\widetilde{g}}}}}_{\mathbf {E}}\) of the conformal class induced by (a real form of) \(\mathbf {E}\), expanding the small catalogue of known explicit, closed-form ambient metrics. We show that the holonomy group of \(\smash {{\smash {\widetilde{g}}}_{\mathbf {E}}}\) is the exceptional group \({\smash {\mathrm{G}}_2^*}\) and use that metric to give explicitly a projective structure with normal projective holonomy equal to that group. We also present some simple but apparently novel observations about ambient metrics of general left-invariant conformal structures that were used in the determination of the explicit formula for \(\smash {{\smash {\widetilde{g}}}_{\mathbf {E}}}\).","Travis Willse

This complex curve encodes the monodromies of a certain Dirac type operator on a quaternionic line bundle associated to the immersion. The paper provides a detailed description of the geometry and asymptotic behavior of the spectral curve. If this curve has finite genus the Dirichlet energy of a map from a 2-torus to the 2-sphere or the Willmore energy of an immersion from a 2-torus into the 4-sphere is given by the residue of a specific meromorphic differential on the curve. Also, the kernel bundle of the Dirac type operator evaluated over points on the 2-torus linearizes in the Jacobian of the spectral curve.

2588,Topological methods in moduli theory,"One of the main themes of this long article is the study of projective varieties which are K(H,1)’s, i.e. classifying spaces BH for some discrete group H. After recalling the basic properties of such classifying spaces, an important class of such varieties is introduced, the one of Bagnera–de Franchis varieties, the quotients of an Abelian variety by the free action of a cyclic group. Moduli spaces of Abelian varieties and of algebraic curves enter into the picture as examples of rational K(H,1)’s, through Teichmüller theory. The main trhust of the paper is to show how in the case of K(H,1)’s the study of moduli spaces and deformation classes can be achieved through by now classical results concerning regularity of classifying maps. The Inoue type varieties of Bauer and Catanese are introduced and studied as a key example, and new results are shown. Motivated from this study, the moduli spaces of algebraic varieties, and especially of algebraic curves with a group of automorphisms of a given topological type are studied in detail, following new results by the author, Michael Lönne and Fabio Perroni. Finally, the action of the absolute Galois group on the moduli spaces of such K(H,1) varieties is studied. In the case of surfaces isogenous to a product, it is shown how this yields a faifhtul action on the set of connected components of the moduli space: for each Galois automorphism of order different from 2 there is an algebraic surface S such that the Galois conjugate surface of S has fundamental group not isomorphic to the one of S.","F.

2593,Exponential Functions in Cartesian Differential Categories,"In this paper, we introduce differential exponential maps in Cartesian differential categories, which generalizes the exponential function \(e^x\) from classical differential calculus. A differential exponential map is an endomorphism which is compatible with the differential combinator in such a way that generalizations of \(e^0 = 1\), \(e^{x+y} = e^x e^y\), and \(\frac{\partial e^x}{\partial x} = e^x\) all hold. Every differential exponential map induces a commutative rig, which we call a differential exponential rig, and conversely, every differential exponential rig induces a differential exponential map. In particular, differential exponential maps can be defined without the need of limits, converging power series, or unique solutions of certain differential equations—which most Cartesian differential categories do not necessarily have. That said, we do explain how every differential exponential map does provide solutions to certain differential equations, and conversely how in the presence of unique solutions, one can derivative a differential exponential map. Examples of differential exponential maps in the Cartesian differential category of real smooth functions include the exponential function, the complex exponential function, the split complex exponential function, and the dual numbers exponential function. As another source of interesting examples, we also study differential exponential maps in the coKleisli category of a differential category.","Jean-Simon Pacaud Lemay

Our tour through algebraic surfaces and their moduli (with results valid also for higher dimensional varieties) deals with fibrations, questions on monodromy and factorizations in the mapping class group, old and new results on Variation of Hodge Structures, especially a recent answer given (in joint work with Dettweiler) to a long standing question posed by Fujita. In the landscape of our tour, Galois coverings, deformations and rigid manifolds (there are by the way rigid Kodaira fibrations), projective classifying spaces, the action of the absolute Galois group on moduli spaces, stand also in the forefront.

2595,QCMC: quasi-conformal parameterizations for multiply-connected domains,"This paper presents a method to compute the quasi-conformal parameterization (QCMC) for a multiply-connected 2D domain or surface. QCMC computes a quasi-conformal map from a multiply-connected domain S onto a punctured disk D

S
 associated with a given Beltrami differential. The Beltrami differential, which measures the conformality distortion, is a complex-valued function \(\mu :S\to \mathbb {C}\) with supremum norm strictly less than 1. Every Beltrami differential gives a conformal structure of S. Hence, the conformal module of D

S
, which are the radii and centers of the inner circles, can be fully determined by μ, up to a Möbius transformation. In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to simultaneously search for the conformal module and the optimal quasi-conformal parameterization. The key idea is to minimize the Beltrami energy with the conformal module of the parameter domain incorporated. The optimal solution is our desired quasi-conformal parameterization onto a punctured disk. The parameterization of the multiply-connected domain simplifies numerical computations and has important applications in various fields, such as in computer graphics and vision. Experiments have been carried out on synthetic data together with real multiply-connected Riemann surfaces. Results show that our proposed method can efficiently compute quasi-conformal parameterizations of multiply-connected domains and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms. Applications of the proposed parameterization technique have also been explored.","Kin Tat Ho1 & Lok Ming Lui

2605,The Heights Theorem for infinite Riemann surfaces,"Marden and Strebel established the Heights Theorem for integrable holomorphic quadratic differentials on parabolic Riemann surfaces. We extends the validity of the Heights Theorem to all surfaces whose fundamental group is of the first kind. In fact, we establish a more general result: the horizontal map which assigns to each integrable holomorphic quadratic differential a measured lamination obtained by straightening the horizontal trajectories of the quadratic differential is injective for an arbitrary Riemann surface with a conformal hyperbolic metric. This was established by Strebel in the case of the unit disk. When a hyperbolic surface has a bounded geodesic pants decomposition, the horizontal map assigns a bounded measured lamination to each integrable holomorphic quadratic differential. When surface has a sequence of closed geodesics whose lengths go to zero, then there exists an integrable holomorphic quadratic differential whose horizontal measured lamination is not bounded.

The class of Anosov subgroups constitutes a natural generalization of convex cocompact subgroups of rank one Lie groups to higher rank. Our main goal is to give several new equivalent characterizations for this important class of discrete subgroups. Our characterizations capture “rank one behavior” of Anosov subgroups and are direct generalizations of rank one equivalents to convex cocompactness. Along the way, we considerably simplify the original definition, avoiding the geodesic flow. We also show that the Anosov condition can be relaxed further by requiring only non-uniform unbounded expansion along the (quasi)geodesics in the group.","Michael Kapovich1, Bernhard Leeb2 & Joan Porti",European Journal of Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40879-017-0192-y,"Discrete subgroups,Anosov subgroups,Symmetric spaces"

In particular, we show that our study has a direct relation with the physically important asymptotically flat spacetimes; which further lead to the Twistor theory of Penrose and the Heaven theory of Newman. As the induced connection, on the degenerate hypersurface, may not be a metric connection, we overcome this difficulty by using differential geometric technique and deduce the embedding conditions called Gauss-Codazzi equations. Finally, we find the integrability conditions for all the possible distributions and specialize the embedding conditions when the ambient space is a complex space form. We add to the list of totally umbilical nondegenerate hypersurfaces [16] the totally umbilical light-like cone, in the degenerate case, and prove the nonexistence of totally umbilical light-like CR hypersurfaces in ¯M(c) withc ≠ 0 (see Yano and Kon [22] and Tashiro and Tachibana [20] for the nondegenerate case).",K.

Examples of non-trivial isospectral deformations were constructed on solvmanifolds for the first time by C.S. Gordon and E. Wilson on the basis of Kirillov theory. This paper considers the isospectral deformations on nilmanifolds from the dynamical point of view. First, we see for certain isospectral deformations that the associated Hamiltonian systems of geodesic flows are decomposed into a collection of reduced systems which are left invariant as Hamiltonian systems under the deformations. This fact is formulated by the “classical Lax equations”. Next, by using a quantization procedure, we attempt to obtain Lax equations for the “reduced Laplacians” from the “classical Lax equations”. As a result, we show that certain isospectral deformations by Gordon-Wilson are represented by the Lax equations.",Ruishi Kuwabara,Annals of Global Analysis and Geometry,1996,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00127973,"

In other words, we consider difference pseudo fields (which are finite direct products of fields) rather than difference fields.

This construction also yields SYZ mirrors to affine conic bundles, as well as a Landau-Ginzburg model which can be naturally viewed as a mirror to \(H\).

We work out what it means to twist Deligne cohomology, by taking degree one twists of both integral cohomology and de Rham cohomology.

We then study an extension of the Fukaya category in which Lagrangians equipped with local systems of arbitrary dimension are admitted as objects, and prove that this extension is generated, in the appropriate sense, by local systems over a cotangent fibre. Whenever the cotangent bundle is simply connected, this generation statement is used to prove that every closed exact Lagrangian of vanishing Maslov index is simply connected.

2636,Index form for nonholonomic distributions,The purpose of this paper is to derive an invariant Jacobi equation for horizontal geodesics on a nonholonomic distribution. The classical Bliss’s theory is known to be not geometrically invariant; it also produces “extra” conjugate points. “Extra” conjugate points also appear in the accessory problem in the optimal control theory. Hence the restriction of the functional of the index form of a curve to the distribution is considered. It is assumed that the distribution satisfies the cyclicity condition. A sufficient condition for the positive definiteness of the index form and the optimality of a curve is obtained.,V. R.

","An orthogonal complex structure on a domain in \({\mathbb {R}^4}\) is a complex structure which is integrable and is compatible with the Euclidean metric. This gives rise to a first order system of partial differential equations which is conformally invariant. We prove two Liouville-type uniqueness theorems for solutions of this system, and use these to give an alternative proof of the classification of compact locally conformally flat Hermitian surfaces first proved by Pontecorvo. We also give a classification of non-degenerate quadrics in \({\mathbb {CP}^3}\) under the action of the conformal group SO

The resulting integral equations are well-conditioned and compatible with standard fast multipole methods and iterative linear algebraic solvers, as well as more modern fast direct solvers. Using layer-potential identities known as Calderón projectors, the Laplace-Beltrami operator can be pre-conditioned from the left and/or right to obtain second-kind integral equations.

We modify the original method by changing the Eulerian representation to include effects due to surface curvature. This modified PDE has the very useful property that any solution which is initially constant perpendicular to the surface remains so at later times. The change remedies many of problems facing the original method, including a need to frequently extend data off of the surface, uncertain boundary conditions, and terribly degenerate parabolic PDEs.

2663,On the Minimum-Time Control Problem for Differential Drive Robots with Bearing Constraints,"This paper presents a study of analysis of minimum-time trajectories for a differential drive robot equipped with a fixed and limited field-of-view camera, which must keep a given landmark in view during maneuvers. Previous works have considered the same physical problem and provided a complete analysis/synthesis for the problem of determining the shortest paths. The main difference in the two cost functions (length vs. time) lays on the rotation on the spot. Indeed, this maneuver has zero cost in terms of length and hence leads to a 2D shortest path synthesis. On the other hand, in case of minimum time, the synthesis depends also on the orientations of the vehicle. In other words, the not zero cost of the rotation on the spot maneuvers leads to a 3D minimum-time synthesis. Moreover, the shortest paths have been obtained by exploiting the geometric properties of the extremal arcs, i.e., straight lines, rotations on the spot, logarithmic spirals and involute of circles. Conversely, in terms of time, even if the extremal arcs of the minimum-time control problem are exactly the same, the geometric properties of these arcs change, leading to a completely different analysis and characterization of optimal paths. In this paper, after proving the existence of optimal trajectories and showing the extremal arcs of the problem at hand, we provide the control laws that steer the vehicle along these arcs and the time-cost along each of them. Moreover, this being a crucial step toward numerical implementation, optimal trajectories are proved to be characterized by a finite number of switching points between different extremal arcs, i.e., the concatenations of extremal arcs with infinitely many junction times are shown to violate the optimality conditions.","Andrea Cristofaro

The time discretization is based on Diethelm’s method where the Hadamard finite-part integral is approximated by using the piecewise quadratic interpolation polynomials. The space discretization is based on the standard finite element method. The error estimates with the convergence order \(O(\tau ^{3-\alpha } + h^2), 0<\alpha <1\) are proved in detail by using the argument developed recently by Lv and Xu (SIAM J Sci Comput 38:A2699–A2724, 2016), where \(\tau \) and h denote the time and space step sizes, respectively.

A singular curve is one for which the associated linearized system is not controllable. If a quadratic positive-definite cost function is introduced, then the corresponding optimal control problem is known as the sub-Riemannian geodesic problem. The original motivation for our work was the question “Are all sub-Riemannian minimizers smooth?” which is equivalent to the question “Are singular minimizers necessarily smooth?” Our main result concerns the singular curves for a class of homogeneous systems whose state spaces are compact Lie groups. We prove that for this class each singular curve lies in a lower-dimensional subgroup within which it is regular and we use this result to prove that all sub-Riemannian minimizers are smooth. A central ingredient of our proof is a symplectic-geometric characterization of singular curves formulated by Hsu. We extend this characterization to nonsmooth singular curves. We find that the symplectic point of view clarifies the situation and simplifies calculations.",Richard Montgomery,"Mathematics of Control, Signals and Systems",1994,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01212270,"Singular extremals,Characteristics,Lie group,Nonholonomic distribution,Differential forms,Sub-Riemannian geometry"

The modified, or relaxed, loss function is the solution of a viscous Hamilton–Jacobi partial differential equation (PDE). Experimental results on modern, high-dimensional neural networks demonstrate that the algorithm converges faster than the benchmark stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Well-established PDE regularity results allow us to analyze the geometry of the relaxed energy landscape, confirming empirical evidence. Stochastic homogenization theory allows us to better understand the convergence of the algorithm.

2680,On integrability in elementary functions of certain classes of nonconservative dynamical systems,"The results of the presented work are due to the study of the applied problem of the rigid body motion in a resisting medium; see [210, 211], where complete lists of transcendental first integrals expressed through a finite combination of elementary functions were obtained. This circumstance allowed the author to perform a complete analysis of all phase trajectories and highlight those properties of them which exhibit the roughness and preserve for systems of a more general form. The complete integrability of those systems is related to symmetries of a latent type. Therefore, it is of interest to study sufficiently wide classes of dynamical systems having analogous latent symmetries.As is known, the concept of integrability is sufficiently broad and undeterminate in general. In its construction, it is necessary to take into account in what sense it is understood (it is meant that a certain criterion according to which one makes a conclusion that the structure of trajectories of the dynamical system considered is especially “attractive and simple”), in which function classes the first integrals are sought for, etc. (see also [1, 4, 14, 17, 20–22, 35, 40–42, 47, 83–85, 117, 120]).In this work, the author applies such an approach such that as first integrals, transcendental functions are elementary. Here, the transcendence is understood not in the sense of elementary functions (e.g., trigonometrical functions) but in the sense that they have essentially singular points (by the classification accepted in the theory of functions of one complex variable according to which a function has essentially singular points). In this case, it is necessary to continue them formally to the complex plane. As a rule, such systems are strongly nonconservative (see also [142, 149, 167, 203–206, 216, 218, 233, 236, 238, 239, 252, 253, 258, 260, 261, 264–266, 269–274, 276–287, 289–292, 295–297, 299–307, 309–315, 320]).",M.

In addition, we show that a five-dimensional Euclidean sphere with an irreducible SO(3)-structure cannot be a conjugate symmetric statistical manifold. Finally, we show some results for a five-dimensional Riemannian manifold with a nearly integrable SO(3)-structure. For example, we prove that the structure tensor of a nearly integrable SO(3)-structure on a five-dimensional Riemannian manifold is a harmonic symmetric tensor and it defines the first integral of third order of the equations of geodesics.

We adopt a topological and geometric point of view and derive a formula for the distance of an approximately controllable system from uncontrollability. We demonstrate by examples that approximately controllable d-d systems may have zero distance from uncontrollability. Thus, the set of approximately controllable d-d systems is not open in the parameter space. To remedy this anomaly, we propose a slight strengthening of the controllability concept and introduce the well-posed property of strict controllability. We show that strictly controllable d-d systems form an open dense subset in the parameter space. Moreover, we show that a d-d system is strictly controllable if and only if it has a positive distance from uncontrollability. Finally, we prove that the d-d systems that are not strictly controllable form a closed set of Lebesgue measure zero and can be represented as the union of a proper algebraic variety and a proper local analytic variety in the parameter space.","D.

In contrast to the classical 3D-VAR formulation that penalizes the measurement error directly, we present a modified formulation that penalizes the experimentally observable misfit in the measurement space. Furthermore, we include a model correction term that allows to obtain an improved state estimate. We begin by discussing the influence of the measurement space on the amplification of noise and prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the identification of a “good” measurement space. We then propose a certified reduced basis (RB) method for the estimation of the model correction, the state prediction, the adjoint solution, and the observable misfit with respect to the true state for real-time and many-query applications. A posteriori bounds are proposed for the error in each of these approximations. Finally, we introduce different approaches for the generation of the reduced basis spaces and the stability-based selection of measurement functionals. The 3D-VAR method and the associated certified reduced basis approximation are tested in a parameter and state estimation problem for a steady-state thermal conduction problem with unknown parameters and unknown Neumann boundary conditions.","Nicole Aretz-Nellesen1, Martin A.

Moreover, for tangentially degenerate submanifolds, a structural theorem is proven. By this theorem, tangentially degenerate submanifolds that do not belong to one of the basic types are foliated into submanifolds of basic types. In the proof the authors introduce irreducible, reducible, and completely reducible tangentially degenerate submanifolds. It is found that cones and tangentially degenerate hypersurfaces are irreducible, and torsal submanifolds are completely reducible while all other tangentially degenerate submanifolds not belonging to basic types are reducible.",Maks A.

−1]. The interpretation of the dynamics represented by a matrix over ? is fixed by the choice of a module ℳ over ?, consisting of all time-trajectories under consideration. In this setup the problem of system equivalence is studied: when do two different AR-representations characterize the same behavior? This problem is solved using a ring extension of ?, that explicitly depends on the choice of the module ℳ of all time-trajectories. In this way the usual divisibility conditions on the system defining matrices can be recovered. The results apply to the class of delay-differential systems with (in)commensurable delays. In this particular application, the ring extension of ? is characterized explicitly.",L. C. G. J. M.

2701,Adaptive Concepts for Stochastic Partial Differential Equations,"An adaptive time stepping method to numerically provide approximate weak approximations of solutions of general SPDEs is proposed, where local step sizes are chosen in regard of the distance between empirical laws of subsequent time iterates and extrapolated data. The histogram-based estimator uses a data-driven partitioning of the high-dimensional state space, and efficient sampling by bootstrapping. Time adaptivity is then complemented by a local refinement/coarsening strategy of the spatial mesh of a stochastic version of the ZZ-estimator. Next to an improved accuracy, we observe a significantly reduced empirical variance of standard estimators, and therefore a reduced sampling effort. The performance of the adaptive strategies is studied for SPDEs with linear drift, including the convection-dominated case where the streamline diffusion method is adopted to attain a stable discretization, and the stochastic version of the non-linear harmonic map heat flow to the sphere \({\mathbb {S}}^{2}\) where approximate solutions exhibit discrete blow-up dynamics.","Andreas Prohl

For our illustrations, we considered two benchmark problems, namely (a) the one-dimensional viscous Burgers with both homogeneous (Dirichlet) and non-homogeneous boundary conditions, and, (b) the one- and two-dimensional Liouville–Bratu–Gelfand PDEs with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. For the one-dimensional Burgers and Bratu PDEs, exact analytical solutions are available and used for comparison purposes against the numerical derived solutions. Furthermore, the numerical efficiency (in terms of numerical accuracy, size of the grid and execution times) of the proposed numerical machine-learning method is compared against central finite differences (FD) and Galerkin weighted-residuals finite-element (FEM) methods. We show that the proposed numerical machine learning method outperforms in terms of numerical accuracy both FD and FEM methods for medium to large sized grids, while provides equivalent results with the FEM for low to medium sized grids; both methods (ELM and FEM) outperform the FD scheme. Furthermore, the computational times required with the proposed machine learning scheme were comparable and in particular slightly smaller than the ones required with FEM.","Gianluca Fabiani1, Francesco Calabrò2, Lucia Russo3 & …Constantinos Siettos

A treatment of the boundary conditions is described that ultimately leads to moderate growth in the spectral radius of the operators with polynomial degree, and in general the norms of the Galerkin Difference differentiation operators are significantly smaller than those arising from standard elements. Lastly, we observe that with the use of the Galerkin Difference space, the standard penalty terms required for discretizing high-order operators are not needed. Numerical results confirm the conclusions of the analyses performed.

There is evidence to support that for a wide class of models, under moment conditions, the nature of this emergence is universal and looks like the classical Erdős-Rényi random graph, in the sense of the critical scaling window and (a) the sizes of the components in this window (all maximal component sizes scaling like n2/3) and (b) the structure of components (rescaled by n−1/3) converge to random fractals related to the continuum random tree. The aim of this note is to give a non-technical overview of recent breakthroughs in this area, emphasizing a particular tool in proving such results called the differential equations technique first developed and used extensively in probabilistic combinatorics in the work of Wormald [52, 53] and developed in the context of critical random graphs by the authors and their collaborators in [10–12].","Shankar Bhamidi1, Amarjit Budhiraja1 & Sanchayan Sen",Indian Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13226-017-0249-0,"Multiplicative coalescent,continuum random tree,critical random graphs,branching processes,inhomogeneous random graphs,configuration model,bounded-size rules"

In the general understanding of edge problems there are two basic aspects: Quantisation of edge-degenerate operators in weighted Sobolev spaces, and verifying the ellipticity of the principal edge symbol \({\sigma_\wedge}\) which includes the (in general not explicitly known) number of additional conditions of trace and potential type on the edge. We focus here on these questions and give explicit answers for a wide class of elliptic operators that are connected with the ellipticity of edge boundary value problems and reductions to the boundary. In particular, we study the edge quantisation and ellipticity for Dirichlet–Neumann operators with respect to interfaces of some codimension on a boundary.

2721,Particle-without-Particle: A Practical Pseudospectral Collocation Method for Linear Partial Differential Equations with Distributional Sources,"Partial differential equations with distributional sources—in particular, involving (derivatives of) delta distributions—have become increasingly ubiquitous in numerous areas of physics and applied mathematics. It is often of considerable interest to obtain numerical solutions for such equations, but any singular (“particle”-like) source modeling invariably introduces nontrivial computational obstacles. A common method to circumvent these is through some form of delta function approximation procedure on the computational grid; however, this often carries significant limitations on the efficiency of the numerical convergence rates, or sometimes even the resolvability of the problem at all. In this paper, we present an alternative technique for tackling such equations which avoids the singular behavior entirely: the “Particle-without-Particle” method. Previously introduced in the context of the self-force problem in gravitational physics, the idea is to discretize the computational domain into two (or more) disjoint pseudospectral (Chebyshev–Lobatto) grids such that the “particle” is always at the interface between them; thus, one only needs to solve homogeneous equations in each domain, with the source effectively replaced by jump (boundary) conditions thereon. We prove here that this method yields solutions to any linear PDE the source of which is any linear combination of delta distributions and derivatives thereof supported on a one-dimensional subspace of the problem domain. We then implement it to numerically solve a variety of relevant PDEs: hyperbolic (with applications to neuroscience and acoustics), parabolic (with applications to finance), and elliptic. We generically obtain improved convergence rates relative to typical past implementations relying on delta function approximations.","Marius Oltean

The efficiency of the CFS algorithm implemented on a MIMD computer is demonstrated by analysis of the solution of the two-dimensional, Poisson equation discretized using both finite and spectral elements. Computation rates and speedups for the LU-decomposition algorithm, which is the most time consuming portion of the solution algorithm, scale with the number of processors. The spectral element discretization with high-order interpolating polynomials yields especially high speedups because the ratio of communication to computation is lower than for low-order finite element discretizations. The robustness of the parallel implementation of the finite-element/Newton algorithm is demonstrated by solution of steady and transient natural convection in a two-dimensional cavity, a standard test problem for low Prandtl number convection. Time integration is performed using a fully implicit algorithm with a modified Newton's method for solution of nonlinear equations at each time step.

2723,The squeezing function on doubly-connected domains via the Loewner differential equation,"For any bounded domains \(\varOmega \) in \({\mathbb {C}}^{n}\), Deng, Guan and Zhang introduced the squeezing function \(S_\varOmega (z)\) which is a biholomorphic invariant of bounded domains. We show that for \(n=1\), the squeezing function on an annulus \(A_r = \lbrace z \in {\mathbb {C}} : r<|z| <1 \rbrace \) is given by \(S_{A_r}(z)= \max \left\{ |z| ,\frac{r}{|z|} \right\} \) for all \(0<r<1\). This disproves the conjectured formula for the squeezing function proposed by Deng, Guan and Zhang and establishes (up to biholomorphisms) the squeezing function for all doubly-connected domains in \({\mathbb {C}}\) other than the punctured plane. It provides the first non-trivial formula for the squeezing function for a wide class of plane domains and answers a question of Wold. Our main tools used to prove this result are the Schottky–Klein prime function (following the work of Crowdy) and a version of the Loewner differential equation on annuli due to Komatu. We also show that these results can be used to obtain lower bounds on the squeezing function for certain product domains in \({\mathbb {C}}^{n}\).","Tuen Wai Ng

2(1), and therefore is contained in S
5(1) gives anegative answer to a question by Weiner. In this paper we generalize theabove mentioned example by investigating Willmore surfaces in S
n(1)which can be obtained as a tensor product immersion of two curves. We inparticular show that in this case too, one of the curves has to beS
1(1), whereas the other one is contained either in S
2(1) or in S
3(1). In the first case, we explicitly determine the immersion interms of elliptic functions, thus constructing infinetely many newnonminimal flat Willmore surfaces in S

2728,Adaptive Finite Difference Methods for Nonlinear Elliptic and Parabolic Partial Differential Equations with Free Boundaries,"Monotone finite difference methods provide stable convergent discretizations of a class of degenerate elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). These methods are best suited to regular rectangular grids, which leads to low accuracy near curved boundaries or singularities of solutions. In this article we combine monotone finite difference methods with an adaptive grid refinement technique to produce a PDE discretization and solver which is applied to a broad class of equations, in curved or unbounded domains which include free boundaries. The grid refinement is flexible and adaptive. The discretization is combined with a fast solution method, which incorporates asynchronous time stepping adapted to the spatial scale. The framework is validated on linear problems in curved and unbounded domains. Key applications include the obstacle problem and the one-phase Stefan free boundary problem.",Adam M.

Through the analysis of adjoint consistency and stability, we present several conditions on the SAT penalties for general operators, including those operators that do not have nodes on their boundary or do not correspond with a collocation discontinuous Galerkin method. Based on these conditions, we generalize the modified scheme of Bassi and Rebay and the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method to SBP-SAT discretizations. Numerical experiments are carried out on unstructured grids with triangular elements to verify the theoretical results.","Jianfeng Yan

2730,A generalization of analytic torsion via differential forms on spaces of metrics,"We introduce multi-torsion, a spectral invariant generalizing Ray–Singer analytic torsion. We define multi-torsion for compact manifolds with a certain local geometric product structure that gives a bigrading on differential forms. We prove that multi-torsion is metric-independent in a suitable sense. Our definition of multi-torsion is inspired by an interpretation of each of analytic torsion and the eta invariant as a regularized integral of a closed differential form on a space of metrics on a vector bundle or on a space of elliptic operators. We generalize the Stokes’ theorem argument explaining the dependence of torsion and eta on the geometric data used to define them to the local product setting to prove our metric-independence theorem for multi-torsion.",Phillip Andreae,Annales mathématiques du Québec,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40316-022-00199-5,"Analytic torsion,Eta invariant"
2731,The Magnus Expansion for Stochastic Differential Equations,"In this paper, all the terms in the stochastic Magnus expansion are presented by rooted trees. First, stochastic Magnus methods for linear stochastic differential equations are constructed by truncating the stochastic Magnus expansion. Then, explicit stochastic Magnus methods are constructed by Picard’s iteration for nonlinear stochastic differential equations on matrix Lie group. Furthermore, general nonlinear stochastic differential equations are transformed into linear operator stochastic differential equations by using the Lie derivative. Finally, numerical methods for general nonlinear stochastic differential equations are constructed by using the theory of the stochastic Magnus expansion for the linear case. In particular, for the commutative case, it is shown that the stochastic Magnus expansion provides a novel way to construct computationally inexpensive and arbitrarily high-order numerical methods while avoiding the simulation of multiple stochastic integrals. Moreover, the proposed methods are shown to preserve the intrinsic properties of the original system well and the numerical experiments agree with the theoretical results.

The application of the BNM is also extended to solve highly oscillatory ODEs directly without reducing the ODE into an equivalent first order system. The BNM is formulated from its continuous scheme which is constructed from an appropriate power series via collocation and interpolation techniques.

These results generalize, on the one hand Pisier and Xu’s result on the variational inequalities for \(\mathcal B\)-valued martingales, on the other hand many classical variational inequalities in harmonic analysis and ergodic theory. Moreover, we show that Rademacher cotype q is necessary for the \(\mathcal B\)-valued q-variational inequalities. As applications of the variational inequalities, we deduce the jump estimates and obtain quantitative information on the rate of convergence.

Two continuous models are introduced, both based on the Smoluchowski theory of Brownian motion. A mass-interaction model predicts local clumping of the internally segregating cell type within a continuum of the other type. A diffusion model simulates the suspension-aggregate experiments of Roth and Weston. A discrete model of sorting out, the exchange model, is re-derived in a clearer manner than before, and certain recent criticisms are responded to. Results in recent two-dimensional cell sorting experiments are discussed and a stability criterion for patterns of multiple clusters is introduced.

They form Parseval frames, have better geometrical sensitivity than traditional wavelets and an implementable framework. Recently, it has been proved that some smoothness spaces can be associated to discrete systems of shearlets. Moreover, there exist embeddings between the classical isotropic dyadic spaces and the shearlet generated spaces. We prove boundedness of pseudo-differential operators (PDO’s) with non regular symbols on the shear anisotropic inhomogeneous Besov spaces and on the shear anisotropic inhomogeneous Triebel–Lizorkin spaces (which are up to now the only Triebel–Lizorkin-type spaces generated by either shearlets or curvelets and more generally by any parabolic molecule, as far as we know). The type of PDO’s that we study includes the classical Hörmander definition with x-dependent parameter \(\delta \) for a range limited by the anisotropy associated to the class. One of the advantages is that the anisotropy of the shearlet spaces is not adapted to that of the PDO.",Daniel Vera,Collectanea Mathematica,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13348-016-0167-1,"Non-regular symbols,Pseudo-differential operators ,Shear anisotropic inhomogeneous spaces,Shearlets"

2744,Tensor-Sparsity of Solutions to High-Dimensional Elliptic Partial Differential Equations,"A recurring theme in attempts to break the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of solutions to high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) is to employ some form of sparse tensor approximation. Unfortunately, there are only a few results that quantify the possible advantages of such an approach. This paper introduces a class \(\Sigma _n\) of functions, which can be written as a sum of rank-one tensors using a total of at most \(n\) parameters, and then uses this notion of sparsity to prove a regularity theorem for certain high-dimensional elliptic PDEs. It is shown, among other results, that whenever the right-hand side \(f\) of the elliptic PDE can be approximated with a certain rate \(\mathcal {O}(n^{-r})\) in the norm of \({\mathrm H}^{-1}\) by elements of \(\Sigma _n\), then the solution \(u\) can be approximated in \({\mathrm H}^1\) from \(\Sigma _n\) to accuracy \(\mathcal {O}(n^{-r'})\) for any \(r'\in (0,r)\). Since these results require knowledge of the eigenbasis of the elliptic operator considered, we propose a second “basis-free” model of tensor-sparsity and prove a regularity theorem for this second sparsity model as well. We then proceed to address the important question of the extent to which such regularity theorems translate into results on computational complexity. It is shown how this second model can be used to derive computational algorithms with performance that breaks the curse of dimensionality on certain model high-dimensional elliptic PDEs with tensor-sparse data.","Wolfgang Dahmen1, Ronald DeVore2, Lars Grasedyck1 & …Endre Süli",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-015-9265-9,"High-dimensional elliptic PDEs,Tensor-sparsity models,Regularity theorems,Exponential sums of operators,Dunford integral,Complexity bounds"

2761,"Minimal surfaces, Hopf differentials and the Ricci condition","We deal with minimal surfaces in a sphere and investigate certain invariants of geometric significance, the Hopf differentials, which are defined in terms of the complex structure and the higher fundamental forms. We discuss the holomorphicity of Hopf differentials and provide a geometric interpretation for it in terms of the higher curvature ellipses. This motivates the study of a class of minimal surfaces, which we call exceptional. We show that exceptional minimal surfaces are related to Lawson’s conjecture regarding the Ricci condition. Indeed, we prove that, under certain conditions, compact minimal surfaces in spheres which satisfy the Ricci condition are exceptional. Thus, under these conditions, the proof of Lawson’s conjecture is reduced to its confirmation for exceptional minimal surfaces. In fact, we provide an affirmative answer to Lawson’s conjecture for exceptional minimal surfaces in odd dimensional spheres or in S

First we give a brief introduction for each of the three methods. Next, we propose benchmark problems, and consider numerical tests—with respect to accuracy and convergence—for linear parabolic problems on a single domain, and continue with similar tests for linear parabolic problems on a composite domain (with the interface defined either explicitly or implicitly). Lastly, a comparative discussion of the methods and numerical results will be given.","Gustav Ludvigsson1, Kyle R.

The approach leads to sufficient conditions for when a boundary value problem can be solved as a lower-dimensional one and it shows how to systematically formulate the lower-dimensional problems. The symmetries are described with Lie groups that are products of connected 1-D Lie groups.","Pasi Raumonen1, Saku Suuriniemi2 & Lauri Kettunen",Boundary Value Problems,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1687-2770-2011-9,"Constitutive Equation,Dimensional Reduction,Differential Form,Orbit Space,Symmetry Transformation"
2765,A three-dimensional mathematical model of active signal processing in axons,"Action potentials in neurons are generated on the plasma membrane through depolarization, i.e. exchange of charges through the membrane. Hodgkin and Huxley developed a mathematical model which describes the interaction of ions through an active plasma membrane. In Vossen et al. (Comput Visual Sci 10:107–121,  2007) we developed a passive three-dimensional (3D) model for signal propagation in dendrite. We now combine this model with a generalized Hodgkin-Huxley model to obtain a 3D-model that describes active signal processing on realistic cell morphologies. Time dependent changes of the neuron’s intra- and extracellular potential is regulated by the Ohmic flux of charges. These fluxes are balanced in membrane-near areas by the capacitory and Hodgkin-Huxley flux. The active model we present consists of five non-linear, coupled integro-differential equations which are solved numerically with a finite volume approach, implicit time stepping and Newton’s method for solving the underlying non-linear system of equations with multigrid solver methods. We present numerical results as well as axon behavior in a biological setting. This model can be considered as a three-dimensional expansion of existing state of the art one-dimensional models, with the significant advantage of being able to investigate the morphological influence of neuron cell types on their specific signaling properties.","Konstantinos Xylouris1, Gillian Queisser1 & Gabriel Wittum",Computing and Visualization in Science,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00791-011-0155-7,"3D-model,Mathematical model,Dendrites,Action potential,Hodgkin-Huxley,Neuron,Signal propagation"

Furthermore we show that the (pseudo-)Kähler metrics defined on some domain in the projective plane which are compatible with the standard complex projective structure are in one-to-one correspondence with the hermitian forms on \(\mathbb {C}^3\) whose rank is at least two. This is achieved by prolonging the relevant finite-type first order linear differential system to closed form.

Thereafter, it is easy to generalize the procedure to Riemann problems for multi-component, two-phase systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, for which the associated 1D Riemann problem has a known solution. The procedure is described for both constant flow rate and constant boundary pressures as imposed Riemann data. In the latter case, the flow rate is time-dependent and its novel analytical solution is constructed in this paper, clearly demonstrating a non-trivial impact of the flow geometry on the solution.",T.

Ellipticity and parametrices are obtained in terms of symbols taking values in algebras of BVPs on manifolds of corresponding lower singularity orders. Those refer to Boutet de Monvel’s calculus of operators with the transmission property, see Boutet de Monvel (Acta Math 126:11–51, 1971) for the case of smooth boundary. On corner configuration operators act in spaces with multiple weights. We mainly study the case of upper left entries in the respective \(2\times 2\) operator block-matrices of such a calculus. Green operators in the sense of Boutet de Monvel (Acta Math 126:11–51, 1971) analogously appear in singular cases, and they are complemented by contributions of Mellin type. We formulate a result on ellipticity and the Fredholm property in weighted corner spaces, with parametrices of analogous kind.","Der-Chen Chang

We also demonstrate how to transmit quadratic estimates between manifolds which are homeomorphic and locally bi-Lipschitz. As a consequence, we demonstrate the invariance of the Kato square root problem under Lipschitz transformations and obtain solutions to this problem on functions and forms on compact manifolds with a rough metric. Furthermore, we show that a lower bound on the injectivity radius is not a necessary condition to solve the Kato square root problem.",Lashi Bandara,Mathematische Zeitschrift,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00209-016-1641-x,"Rough metrics,Quadratic estimates,Kato square root problem"

If the lines are geodesics with respect to a natural connection \({\nabla^{\circ}}\), then a detailed classification of them as well as of the corresponding geometries is obtained. Generalizations of complex Grünwald planes play a main role in the classification. Since in the considered geometries the set of lines is invariant under the translation group of \({\mathbb{C}^n}\), we classify all complex curves C in \({\mathbb{C}^n}\) given by entire functions as well as the connections \({\nabla^\circ}\) such that all images of C under the translation group of \({\mathbb C^n}\) consist of geodesics with respect to \({\nabla^{\circ}}\).","Olga Belova1, Josef Mikeš2 & Karl Strambach",Results in Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00025-015-0518-3,"52C22,51B15,51N99"

The pair (Φ,Ψ) is equivalent to Joshi and Lionheart’s operator Π and determines Belishev and Sharafutdinov’s operator Λ.

Such a tangent bundle is made into a manifold of almost Kaehlerian structure by endowing it with Sasakian metric. The components of curvature tensors with respect to the adapted frame are presented.

2799,Exactly and completely integrable nonlinear dynamical systems,"This survey is devoted to a consistent exposition of the group-algebraic methods for the integration of systems of nonlinear partial differential equations possessing a nontrivial internal symmetry algebra. Samples of exactly and completely integrable wave and evolution equations are considered in detail, including the generalized (periodic and finite nonperiodic) Toda lattice, nonlinear Schrödinger, Korteweg-de Vries, Lotka-Volterra equations, etc.). For exactly integrable systems, the general solutions of the Cauchy and Goursat problems are given in an explicit form, while for completely integrable systems an effective method for the construction of their soliton solutions is developed.Application of the developed methods to a differential geometry problem of the classification of integrable manifolds embeddings is discussed.Supersymmetric extensions are constructed for exactly integrable systems. Using an example of the generalized Toda lattice, a quantization scheme is developed. It includes an explicit derivation of the corresponding Heisenberg operators and their description in terms of Hopf-type quantum algebras.Among multidimensional systems, the four-dimensional self-dual Yang-Mills equations are investigated with the aim of constructing their general solutions.",A.

2803,Bistability and oscillations in chemical reaction networks,"Bifurcation theory is one of the most widely used approaches for analysis of dynamical behaviour of chemical and biochemical reaction networks. Some of the interesting qualitative behaviour that are analyzed are oscillations and bistability (a situation where a system has at least two coexisting stable equilibria). Both phenomena have been identified as central features of many biological and biochemical systems. This paper, using the theory of stoichiometric network analysis (SNA) and notions from algebraic geometry, presents sufficient conditions for a reaction network to display bifurcations associated with these phenomena. The advantage of these conditions is that they impose fewer algebraic conditions on model parameters than conditions associated with standard bifurcation theorems. To derive the new conditions, a coordinate transformation will be made that will guarantee the existence of branches of positive equilibria in the system. This is particularly useful in mathematical biology, where only positive variable values are considered to be meaningful. The first part of the paper will be an extended introduction to SNA and algebraic geometry-related methods which are used in the coordinate transformation and set up of the theorems. In the second part of the paper we will focus on the derivation of bifurcation conditions using SNA and algebraic geometry. Conditions will be derived for three bifurcations: the saddle-node bifurcation, a simple branching point, both linked to bistability, and a simple Hopf bifurcation. The latter is linked to oscillatory behaviour. The conditions derived are sufficient and they extend earlier results from stoichiometric network analysis as can be found in (Aguda and Clarke in J Chem Phys 87:3461–3470, 1987; Clarke and Jiang in J Chem Phys 99:4464–4476, 1993; Gatermann et al. in J Symb Comput 40:1361–1382, 2005). In these papers some necessary conditions for two of these bifurcations were given. A set of examples will illustrate that algebraic conditions arising from given sufficient bifurcation conditions are not more difficult to interpret nor harder to calculate than those arising from necessary bifurcation conditions. Hence an increasing amount of information is gained at no extra computational cost. The theory can also be used in a second step for a systematic bifurcation analysis of larger reaction networks.",Mirela Domijan1 & Markus Kirkilionis,Journal of Mathematical Biology,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-008-0234-7,"Polynomial differential equations,Bifurcation theory,Extreme currents"

From the idea that all these problems can be treated as problems with an operator-valued symbol, a general regular scheme of adiabatic approximation based on operator methods is proposed. This scheme is a generalization of the Born–Oppenheimer and Maslov methods, the Peierls substitution, etc. The approach proposed in this paper allows one to obtain “effective” reduced equations for a wide class of states inside terms (i.e., inside modes, subbands of dimensional quantization, etc.) with possible degeneration taken into account. Next, by application of asymptotic methods, in particular the semiclassical approximation method, to the reduced equation, the states corresponding to a distinguished term (effective Hamiltonian) can be classified. It is shown that the adiabatic effective Hamiltonian and the semiclassical Hamiltonian can be different, which results in the appearance of “nonstandard characteristics” while passing to classical mechanics. This approach is used to construct solutions of several problems in wave and quantum mechanics, particularly problems in molecular physics, solid-state physics, nanophysics and hydrodynamics.","V. V.

Suppose that the complex polynomial P(iz, 1) has distinct roots and that P(z, 0) = zn. The operators which we investigate are of the form P(X, Y) where X = δx and Y = δy + xδw for variables (x, y, w) ∈ ℝ3. We find that the operators P (X, Y) are locally solvable if and only if the kernels of the ordinary differential operators P(iδx, ± x)* contain no Schwartz-class functions other than the zero function. The proof of this theorem involves the construction of a parametrix along with invariance properties of Heisenberg group operators and the application of Sobolev-space inequalities by Hörmander as necessary conditions for local solvability.",Christopher J.

2838,Projective compactness and conformal boundaries,"For complete affine manifolds we treat a recently introduced general notion of compactification based on the projective differential geometry (i.e. geodesic path data) of the given connection. This involves a real parameter called the order of projective compactness; for volume preserving connections, this order is a measure of asymptotic volume growth. Via the Levi-Civita connection, this concept applies to complete pseudo-Riemannian metrics. So projective compactness provides a geometrically motivated alternative to conformal compactification. We study the fundamental links between interior geometry and the embedding of the boundary hypersurface at infinity, and develop the tools that describe the induced geometry on this boundary. We prove that a pseudo-Riemannian metric which is projectively compact of order two admits a certain asymptotic form. This form was known to be sufficient for projective compactness, so the result establishes that it provides an equivalent characterization. From a projectively compact connection on M, one obtains a projective structure on the compactified manifold with boundary \(\overline{M}\). We show this induces a, possibly degenerate, conformal structure on the boundary hypersurface \(\partial M\). We prove that in the case of metrics which are projectively compact of order two this boundary structure is in fact always non-degenerate. We also prove that in this case the metric is necessarily asymptotically Einstein, in a natural sense. Finally, a non-degenerate conformal boundary geometry gives rise to a conformal standard tractor bundle (on the boundary) endowed with a canonical linear connection, and we explicitly describe these in terms of the projective data of the interior geometry.",Andreas Čap1 & A.

Specifically, we consider meshes in which each element is the image of a cubical reference element under a diffeomorphism, and finite element spaces in which the shape functions and degrees of freedom are obtained from the reference element by pullback of differential forms. In the case where the diffeomorphisms from the reference element are all affine, i.e., mesh consists of parallelotopes, it is standard that the rate of convergence in \(L^2\) exceeds by one the degree of the largest full polynomial space contained in the reference space of shape functions. When the diffeomorphism is multilinear, the rate of convergence for the same space of reference shape function may degrade severely, the more so when the form degree is larger. The main result of the paper gives a sufficient condition on the reference shape functions to obtain a given rate of convergence.","Douglas N.

2849,A Novel Weakly-Intrusive Non-linear Multiresolution Framework for Uncertainty Quantification in Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations,"In this paper, a novel multiresolution framework, namely the Truncate and Encode (TE) approach, previously proposed by some of the authors (Abgrall et al. in J Comput Phys 257:19–56, 2014. doi:10.1016/j.jcp.2013.08.006), is generalized and extended for taking into account uncertainty in partial differential equations (PDEs). Innovative ingredients are given by an algorithm permitting to recover the multiresolution representation without requiring the fully resolved solution, the possibility to treat a whatever form of pdf and the use of high-order (even non-linear, i.e. data-dependent) reconstruction in the stochastic space. Moreover, the spatial-TE method is introduced, which is a weakly intrusive scheme for uncertainty quantification (UQ), that couples the physical and stochastic spaces by minimizing the computational cost for PDEs. The proposed scheme is particularly attractive when treating moving discontinuities (such as shock waves in compressible flows), even if they appear during the simulations as it is common in unsteady aerodynamics applications. The proposed method is very flexible since it can easily coupled with different deterministic schemes, even with high-resolution features. Flexibility and performances of the present method are demonstrated on various numerical test cases (algebraic functions and ordinary differential equations), including partial differential equations, both linear and non-linear, in presence of randomness. The efficiency of the proposed strategy for solving stochastic linear advection and Burgers equation is shown by comparison with some classical techniques for UQ, namely Monte Carlo or the non-intrusive polynomial chaos methods.","Gianluca Geraci1, Pietro Marco Congedo2, Rémi Abgrall3 & …Gianluca Iaccarino",Journal of Scientific Computing,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-015-0026-3,"Multiresolution,Uncertainty quantification,Adaptive grid,ENO,MUSCL,Hyperbolic conservation laws"
2850,Simulation of Dynamic Earthquake Ruptures in Complex Geometries Using High-Order Finite Difference Methods,"We develop a stable and high-order accurate finite difference method for problems in earthquake rupture dynamics in complex geometries with multiple faults. The bulk material is an isotropic elastic solid cut by pre-existing fault interfaces that accommodate relative motion of the material on the two sides. The fields across the interfaces are related through friction laws which depend on the sliding velocity, tractions acting on the interface, and state variables which evolve according to ordinary differential equations involving local fields.The method is based on summation-by-parts finite difference operators with irregular geometries handled through coordinate transforms and multi-block meshes. Boundary conditions as well as block interface conditions (whether frictional or otherwise) are enforced weakly through the simultaneous approximation term method, resulting in a provably stable discretization.The theoretical accuracy and stability results are confirmed with the method of manufactured solutions. The practical benefits of the new methodology are illustrated in a simulation of a subduction zone megathrust earthquake, a challenging application problem involving complex free-surface topography, nonplanar faults, and varying material properties.","Jeremy E.

Degeneration of the target and judicious localization expresses such classes in terms of localization trees weighted by “top intersections” of tautological classes and genus 0 double Hurwitz numbers. This identity of generating series can be inverted, yielding a “combinatorialization” of top intersections of \({\Psi}\) -classes. As genus 0 double Hurwitz numbers with at most 3 parts over ∞ are well understood, we obtain Faber’s Intersection Number Conjecture for up to 3 parts, and an approach to the Conjecture in general (bypassing the Virasoro Conjecture).

2852,Optimized Schwarz Methods with Elliptical Domain Decompositions,"Over the past decade, partial differential equation models in elliptical geometries have become a focus of interest in several scientific and engineering applications: the classical studies of flow past a cylinder, the spherical particles in nano-fluids and spherical water filled domains are replaced by elliptical geometries which more accurately describe a wider class of physical problems of interest. Optimized Schwarz methods (OSMs) are among the best parallel methods for such models. We study here for the first time OSMs with elliptical domain decompositions, i.e. decompositions into an ellipse and elliptical rings. Using the technique of separation of variables, we decouple the spatial variables and reduce the subdomain problems to radial Mathieu like equations defined on finite intervals, which allows us to derive and study a new family of OSMs. Our analysis reveals that the optimized transmission parameters are not constants any more along the elliptical interfaces. We can prove however also that using the constant optimized parameters from the straight interface analysis in the literature scaled locally by the interface curvature is still efficient in an asymptotic sense, which leads to the important discovery of a unique factor in the optimized parameters and asymptotic performance determined by the geometry of the decomposition. We use numerical examples to illustrate our analysis and findings.","Xin Chen1, Martin J.

2853,Method of Moving Frames to Solve Conservation Laws on Curved Surfaces,"A new numerical framework is proposed to solve partial differential equations on curved surfaces by using the orthogonal moving frames at each grid point to compute the gradient of a scalar variable. We call this framework the method of moving frames (MMF) that is adopted and modified from the works of É. Cartan. Compared to the Eulerian method and the Lagrangian multiplier method, the MMF method uses only the surface as the domain, not additionally the ambient space enclosing it. Also different from directly solving the equations with respect to the curved axis, the MMF method is free of the metric tensors. This uniqueness is the consequence of the virtual and penalty extension of the variables in a special direction, called the exponential direction, instead of the surface normal direction that is typically taken. The exponential extension eliminates the need to extend the computational domain and the variables outside the curved surfaces, but the variables outside the curved surfaces are not extended in the direction of the surface normal, yielding an extension error. However, the overall error for the MMF scheme, caused by the extension error, is of high order in L
2 error with respect to space discretization. This high convergence rate implies that the exponential error can be made negligible compared to the error of differentiation and integration, which are also expressed with space discretization but with lower order, in adaptively-refined meshes proportional to the Gaussian curvature. As the first application of the MMF method, conservation laws are considered on curved surfaces. To display the exponential convergence and the unique features of the MMF scheme, convergence tests are demonstrated on four different types of surfaces: an open spherical shell, a closed spherical shell, an irregular closed surface, and a non-convex closed surface.","Sehun Chun1,",Journal of Scientific Computing,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-011-9570-7,"Method of moving frames,Numerical solutions of partial differential equations on curved surfaces,Conservation law,Discontinuous Galerkin methods"

2855,On geodesic completeness for Riemannian metrics on smooth probability densities,"The geometric approach to optimal transport and information theory has triggered the interpretation of probability densities as an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold. The most studied Riemannian structures are the Otto metric, yielding the \(L^2\)-Wasserstein distance of optimal mass transport, and the Fisher–Rao metric, predominant in the theory of information geometry. On the space of smooth probability densities, none of these Riemannian metrics are geodesically complete—a property desirable for example in imaging applications. That is, the existence interval for solutions to the geodesic flow equations cannot be extended to the whole real line. Here we study a class of Hamilton–Jacobi-like partial differential equations arising as geodesic flow equations for higher-order Sobolev type metrics on the space of smooth probability densities. We give order conditions for global existence and uniqueness, thereby providing geodesic completeness. The system we study is an interesting example of a flow equation with loss of derivatives, which is well-posed in the smooth category, yet non-parabolic and fully non-linear. On a more general note, the paper establishes a link between geometric analysis on the space of probability densities and analysis of Euler–Arnold equations in topological hydrodynamics.","Martin Bauer1, Sarang Joshi2 & Klas Modin3,",Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00526-017-1195-8,"58B20,58E10,35G25,35Q31,76N10"

Each face of the dimer corresponds to a Lagrangian disk with boundary on our tropical Lagrangian submanifold, forming a Lagrangian mutation seed. Using this we find tropical Lagrangian tori \(L_{T^2}\) in the complement of a smooth anticanonical divisor of a toric del-Pezzo whose wall-crossing transformations match those of monotone SYZ fibers. An example is worked out for the mirror pair \((\mathbb {CP}^2{\setminus } E, W), {\check{X}}_{9111}\). We find a symplectomorphism of \(\mathbb {CP}^2{\setminus } E\) interchanging \(L_{T^2}\) and a SYZ fiber. Evidence is provided that this symplectomorphism is mirror to fiberwise Fourier–Mukai transform on \({\check{X}}_{9111}\).

2871,Projective minimality for centroaffine minimal surfaces,"Centroaffine minimal surfaces are considered as an interesting class of surfaces from the viewpoint of not only variational problems in centroaffine differential geometry but also integrable systems. Typical examples of centroaffine minimal surfaces are proper affine spheres centered at the origin when we regard them as centroaffine surfaces. On the other hand, the study of projective minimal surfaces has a long history in projective differential geometry. Typical examples of projective minimal surfaces are proper affine spheres again, and so-called Demoulin surfaces or Godeaux-Rozet surfaces. In this paper, we shall regard centroaffine surfaces as projective surfaces and study projective minimality of centroaffine minimal surfaces. Using the fact that any centroaffine minimal surfaces have a one-parameter family of deformation known as associated surfaces, we shall give a classification of indefinite centroaffine minimal surfaces whose associated surfaces are all projective minimal, which includes centroaffine surfaces with vanishing Tchebychev operator and those found by the first author before. We shall also show that any indefinite centroaffine minimal surface whose associated surfaces are all Godeaux-Rozet surfaces is a proper affine sphere.","Atsushi Fujioka1, Hitoshi Furuhata2 & Takeshi Sasaki",Journal of Geometry,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00022-013-0196-9,"Primary 53A15,Secondary 53A20,53A10"

Then we introduce the notion of para-complex affine immersions and apply the above results to obtain existence and uniqueness theorems for para-complex affine immersions. This is a generalization of the results obtained by Abe and Kurosu [AK] to para-complex geometry. Further we prove that any connection with vanishing (0, 2)-curvature, with respect to the grading defined by the para-complex structure, induces a unique para-holomorphic structure.","Marie Amélie Lawn1,2 & Lars Schäfer1,",Results in Mathematics,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03323368,"para-complex and para-holomorphic vector bundles,para-complex and para-holomorphic affine immersions,affine para-Kähler immersions"

2880,Discrete Moving Frames on Lattice Varieties and Lattice-Based Multispaces,"In this paper, we develop the theory of the discrete moving frame in two different ways. In the first half of the paper, we consider a discrete moving frame defined on a lattice variety and the equivalence classes of global syzygies that result from the first fundamental group of the variety. In the second half, we consider the continuum limit of discrete moving frames as a local lattice coalesces to a point. To achieve a well-defined limit of discrete frames, we construct multispace, a generalisation of the jet bundle that also generalises Olver’s one-dimensional construction. Using interpolation to provide coordinates, we prove that it is a manifold containing the usual jet bundle as a submanifold. We show that continuity of a multispace moving frame ensures that the discrete moving frame converges to a continuous one as lattices coalesce. The smooth frame is, at the same time, the restriction of the multispace frame to the embedded jet bundle. We prove further that the discrete invariants and syzygies approximate their smooth counterparts. In effect, a frame on multispace allows smooth frames and their discretisations to be studied simultaneously. In our last chapter we discuss two important applications, one to the discrete variational calculus, and the second to discrete integrable systems. Finally, in an appendix, we discuss a more general result concerning equicontinuous families of discretisations of moving frames, which are consistent with a smooth frame.","Gloria Marí Beffa2 & Elizabeth L.
