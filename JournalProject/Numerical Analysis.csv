1,Poisson–Nernst–Planck Systems for Ion Flow with Density Functional Theory for Hard-Sphere Potential: I–V Relations and Critical Potentials. Part II: Numerics,"We consider a one-dimensional steady-state Poisson–Nernst–Planck type model for ionic flow through membrane channels. Improving the classical Poisson–Nernst–Planck models where ion species are treated as point charges, this model includes ionic interaction due to finite sizes of ion species modeled by hard sphere potential from the Density Functional Theory. The resulting problem is a singularly perturbed boundary value problem of an integro-differential system. We examine the problem and investigate the ion size effect on the current–voltage (I–V) relations numerically, focusing on the case where two oppositely charged ion species are involved and only the hard sphere components of the excess chemical potentials are included. Two numerical tasks are conducted. The first one is a numerical approach of solving the boundary value problem and obtaining I–V curves. This is accomplished through a numerical implementation of the analytical strategy introduced by Ji and Liu in [Poisson–Nernst–Planck systems for ion flow with density functional theory for hard-sphere potential: I–V relations and critical potentials.

We formulate a stochastic version of it which arises by incorporating random input and has the structure of a damped stochastic Hamiltonian system with nonlinear displacement. We then investigate path properties and moment bounds of the model. Moreover, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the model and provide long-time stability results by establishing the geometric ergodicity of the system, which means that the system—independently of the initial values—always converges to an invariant measure.

Classical solutions of the theory of hyperbolic partial differential equation such as discontinuities (shock and contact discontinuities), rarefactions and diffusive traveling waves are extended for variables living on a surface \(\mathcal {S}\), which is defined as solution of a set of algebraic equations. We propose here an alternative formulation to study numerically and theoretically the PDAEs by changing the algebraic conditions into partial differential equations with relaxation source terms (PDREs). The solution of such relaxed systems is proved to tend to the surface \(\mathcal {S}\), i.e., to satisfy the algebraic equations for long times. We formulate a unified numerical scheme for systems of PDAEs and PDREs. This scheme is naturally parallelizable and has faster convergence. We do not perform a rigorous analysis about the convergence or accuracy for the method, the evidence of its effectiveness is presented by means of simulations for physical and synthetical problems.","Wanderson Lambert

We nevertheless prove the existence and uniqueness of an admissible solution to the Riemann problem. This solution remains bounded with positive volume fractions even when one the phases vanishes. We conclude that the multiphase/single phase transition does not imply mechanical equilibrium but displays a non classical wave structure. In the numerical part of the paper we propose some approximate Riemann solvers to simulate the model, especially the multiphase/single phase transition. The classical Riemann solvers have been considered as Godunov scheme, Roe scheme with or without entropy fix. We also propose an in-cell discontinuous reconstruction method which proves to be successful, whereas the other schemes may show some spurious oscillations in some Riemann problem. Finally, as an application we study and simulate the problem of phase separation by gravity.","M. Ndjinga1, T. P. K. Nguyen1,2 & C.

9,"Eigenvalues and delay differential equations: periodic coefficients, impulses and rigorous numerics","We develop validated numerical methods for the computation of Floquet multipliers of equilibria and periodic solutions of delay differential equations, as well as impulsive delay differential equations. Using our methods, one can rigorously count the number of Floquet multipliers outside a closed disc centered at zero or the number of multipliers contained in a compact set bounded away from zero. We consider systems with a single delay where the period is at most equal to the delay, and the latter two are commensurate. We first represent the monodromy operator (period map) as an operator acting on a product of sequence spaces that represent the Chebyshev coefficients of the state-space vectors. Truncation of the number of modes yields the numerical method, and by carefully bounding the truncation error in addition to some other technical operator norms, this leads to the method being suitable to computer-assisted proofs of Floquet multiplier location. We demonstrate the computer-assisted proofs on two example problems. We also test our discretization scheme in floating point arithmetic on a gamut of randomly-generated high-dimensional examples with both periodic and constant coefficients to inspect the precision of the spectral radius estimation of the monodromy operator (i.e. stability/instability check for periodic systems) for increasing numbers of Chebyshev modes.","Kevin E.

10,Numerical Hilbert space solution of fractional Sobolev equation in \(\left(1+1\right)\)-dimensional space,"This paper equipped the time- and space-fractional Sobolev equation with the condition of the Caputo fractional derivative in \(\left(1+1\right)\)-dimensional space to be solved with the help of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space method. The aforesaid method depends on building two Hilbert spaces where the coefficients of fractional expansion are produced by using the generalized Gram Schmidt process. With the use of the Fourier functions expansion theorem, the numeric-analytic solutions are expressed by collection sets of orthonormal functions system in \(\mathfrak{A}\left(\mathcal{U}\right)\) and \(\mathfrak{B}\left(\mathcal{U}\right)\) spaces. In this flair, novel steps are fitted for the covering fractional Sobolev equation and the utilized numeric-analytic approach. To display the obtained results and theories, a variety of tables and graphics will be displayed and exhibited. The received effects imply that the technique is shrewd and has numerous capabilities balance for managing many fractional fashions rising in physics and applied mathematics by the Caputo class derivative. Future work and several notes are collected in the final part.","Omar Abu Arqub

The authors first transform the problem into a parameterized polynomial optimization problem, and obtain a numerical ranking function using polynomial sum-of-squares relaxation via semidefinite programming (SDP). A rational vector recovery algorithm is deployed to recover a rational polynomial from the numerical ranking function, and some symbolic computation techniques are used to certify that this polynomial is an exact ranking function of the loop programs. At last, the authors demonstrate on some polynomial loop programs from the literature that our algorithm successfully yields nonlinear ranking functions with rational coefficients.","Liyong Shen1, Min Wu2, Zhengfeng Yang2 & …Zhenbing Zeng",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-013-1004-1,"Program verification,ranking function,semidefinite programming,symbolic-numeric hybrid method"
12,Topological Approach to Rigorous Numerics of Chaotic Dynamical Systems with Strong Expansion of Error Bounds,"A new algorithm for obtaining rigorous results concerning the existence of chaotic invariant sets of dynamical systems generated by non-autonomous, time-periodic differential equations is presented. Unlike all other algorithms the presented algorithm does not require the numerical integration of the solutions and as a consequence it is insensitive to the rapid error growth in the case of long integration. The result is based on a new theoretical approach to the computation of the homology of the Poincaré map. A concrete numerical example concerning a time-periodic differential equation in the complex plane is provided.","Marian Mrozek1,2 & Roman Srzednicki",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-009-9053-5,"Poincaré map,Fixed point index,Isolating block,Symbolic dynamics,Interval arithmetic,Rigorous numerical algorithm"
13,A Symbolic-Numeric Validation Algorithm for Linear ODEs with Newton–Picard Method,"A symbolic-numeric validation algorithm is developed to compute rigorous and tight uniform error bounds for polynomial approximate solutions to linear ordinary differential equations, and in particular D-finite functions. It relies on an a posteriori validation scheme, where such an error bound is computed afterwards, independently from how the approximation was built. Contrary to Newton–Galerkin validation methods, widely used in the mathematical community of computer-assisted proofs, our algorithm does not rely on finite-dimensional truncations of differential or integral operators, but on an efficient approximation of the resolvent kernel using a Chebyshev spectral method. The result is a much better complexity of the validation process, carefully investigated throughout this article. Indeed, the approximation degree for the resolvent kernel depends linearly on the magnitude of the input equation, while the truncation order used in Newton–Galerkin may be exponential in the same quantity. Numerical experiments based on an implementation in C corroborate this complexity advantage over other a posteriori validation methods, including Newton–Galerkin.",Florent Bréhard,Mathematics in Computer Science,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11786-021-00510-7,"Validated numerics,A posteriori validation,Chebyshev spectral methods,Linear differential equations,D-finite functions"

17,The need for knowledge and reliability in numeric computation: Case study of multivariate Padé approximation,"In this paper we review and link the numeric research projects carried out at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Antwerp since 1978. Results have and are being obtained in various areas. A lot of effort has been put in the theoretical investigation of the multivariate Padé approximation problem using different definitions (see Sections 3 and 7). The numerical implementation raises two delicate issues. First, there is the need to see the wood for the trees again: switching from one to many variables greatly increases the number of choices to be made on the way (see Sections 1 and 5). Second, there is the typical problem of breakdown when computing ratios of determinants: the added value of interval arithmetic combined with defect correction turns out to be significant (see Sections 2 and 4). In Section 6 these two problems are thoroughly illustrated and the interested reader is taken by the hand and guided through a typical computation session. On the way some open problems are indicated which motivate us to continue our research mainly in the area of gathering and offering more knowledge about the problem domain on one hand, and improving the arithmetic tools and numerical routines for a reliable computation of the approximants on the other hand.",Annie Cuyt1 & Brigitte Verdonk,Acta Applicandae Mathematica,1993,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00995490,"41A21,65D20"

We also test our discretization scheme in floating point arithmetic on a gamut of randomly-generated high-dimensional examples with both periodic and constant coefficients to inspect the precision of the spectral radius estimation of the monodromy operator (i.e. stability/instability check for periodic systems) for increasing numbers of Chebyshev modes.","Kevin E.

29,Numerical Hilbert space solution of fractional Sobolev equation in \(\left(1+1\right)\)-dimensional space,"This paper equipped the time- and space-fractional Sobolev equation with the condition of the Caputo fractional derivative in \(\left(1+1\right)\)-dimensional space to be solved with the help of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space method. The aforesaid method depends on building two Hilbert spaces where the coefficients of fractional expansion are produced by using the generalized Gram Schmidt process. With the use of the Fourier functions expansion theorem, the numeric-analytic solutions are expressed by collection sets of orthonormal functions system in \(\mathfrak{A}\left(\mathcal{U}\right)\) and \(\mathfrak{B}\left(\mathcal{U}\right)\) spaces. In this flair, novel steps are fitted for the covering fractional Sobolev equation and the utilized numeric-analytic approach. To display the obtained results and theories, a variety of tables and graphics will be displayed and exhibited. The received effects imply that the technique is shrewd and has numerous capabilities balance for managing many fractional fashions rising in physics and applied mathematics by the Caputo class derivative. Future work and several notes are collected in the final part.","Omar Abu Arqub

30,Generating exact nonlinear ranking functions by symbolic-numeric hybrid method,"This paper presents a hybrid symbolic-numeric algorithm to compute ranking functions for establishing the termination of loop programs with polynomial guards and polynomial assignments. The authors first transform the problem into a parameterized polynomial optimization problem, and obtain a numerical ranking function using polynomial sum-of-squares relaxation via semidefinite programming (SDP). A rational vector recovery algorithm is deployed to recover a rational polynomial from the numerical ranking function, and some symbolic computation techniques are used to certify that this polynomial is an exact ranking function of the loop programs. At last, the authors demonstrate on some polynomial loop programs from the literature that our algorithm successfully yields nonlinear ranking functions with rational coefficients.","Liyong Shen1, Min Wu2, Zhengfeng Yang2 & …Zhenbing Zeng",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-013-1004-1,"Program verification,ranking function,semidefinite programming,symbolic-numeric hybrid method"

Unlike all other algorithms the presented algorithm does not require the numerical integration of the solutions and as a consequence it is insensitive to the rapid error growth in the case of long integration.

32,A Symbolic-Numeric Validation Algorithm for Linear ODEs with Newton–Picard Method,"A symbolic-numeric validation algorithm is developed to compute rigorous and tight uniform error bounds for polynomial approximate solutions to linear ordinary differential equations, and in particular D-finite functions. It relies on an a posteriori validation scheme, where such an error bound is computed afterwards, independently from how the approximation was built. Contrary to Newton–Galerkin validation methods, widely used in the mathematical community of computer-assisted proofs, our algorithm does not rely on finite-dimensional truncations of differential or integral operators, but on an efficient approximation of the resolvent kernel using a Chebyshev spectral method. The result is a much better complexity of the validation process, carefully investigated throughout this article. Indeed, the approximation degree for the resolvent kernel depends linearly on the magnitude of the input equation, while the truncation order used in Newton–Galerkin may be exponential in the same quantity. Numerical experiments based on an implementation in C corroborate this complexity advantage over other a posteriori validation methods, including Newton–Galerkin.",Florent Bréhard,Mathematics in Computer Science,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11786-021-00510-7,"Validated numerics,A posteriori validation,Chebyshev spectral methods,Linear differential equations,D-finite functions"

Results have and are being obtained in various areas. A lot of effort has been put in the theoretical investigation of the multivariate Padé approximation problem using different definitions (see Sections 3 and 7). The numerical implementation raises two delicate issues. First, there is the need to see the wood for the trees again: switching from one to many variables greatly increases the number of choices to be made on the way (see Sections 1 and 5). Second, there is the typical problem of breakdown when computing ratios of determinants: the added value of interval arithmetic combined with defect correction turns out to be significant (see Sections 2 and 4). In Section 6 these two problems are thoroughly illustrated and the interested reader is taken by the hand and guided through a typical computation session. On the way some open problems are indicated which motivate us to continue our research mainly in the area of gathering and offering more knowledge about the problem domain on one hand, and improving the arithmetic tools and numerical routines for a reliable computation of the approximants on the other hand.",Annie Cuyt1 & Brigitte Verdonk,Acta Applicandae Mathematica,1993,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00995490,"41A21,65D20"

Comparing with existing literature, our numerical scheme gains advantage in terms of preserving the biological meanings (such as positivity or invariance of total population) unconditionally. An implicit–explicit technique is implemented in the time integration, which ensures the numerical positivity without CFL conditions while reducing the computation complexity. The solvability, convergence in finite time and the long-time behaviors of numerical solutions are investigated. A threshold value \(R_{0}^{\Delta x}\) for the long-time dynamics of numerical solutions is proposed, which is named as a numerical basic reproduction number. It is proved that the numerical disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if \(R_{0}^{\Delta x}<1\) and unstable if \(R_{0}^{\Delta x}>1\). It is presented that \(R_{0}^{\Delta x}\) shares the same monotonicity and limits as the basic reproduction number of the underlying model and converges to the exact one.

The measurements of the bay surface temperature field were carried out as well as the corresponding 3D water flow simulations on the realistically modeled bay. The accuracy of the simulation results was evaluated by the comparison of computed and measured surface temperatures. Furthermore, numerical meshes of different density were used in order to determine model sensitivity where the results showed a significant effect of the mesh density on the simulation results. Although the simulations obtained with a denser mesh yield more accurate results and allow for the reconstruction of heated water surface flow with better reliability, the sparser mesh provided sufficiently accurate results as well. The overall temperature field obtained with the numerical model agrees well with the measured temperature values, which demonstrates the successful application of the 3D flow numerical model on the Plomin bay thermal pollution problem.","Adrijana Radošević1, Luka Sopta1 & Alfredo Višković",ANNALI DELL'UNIVERSITA' DI FERRARA,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11565-008-0055-z,"Thermal pollution,Buoyancy driven flow,Computational fluid dynamics,Mesh density,Navier stokes equations"

45,A Comparative Study from Spectral Analyses of High-Order Methods with Non-Constant Advection Velocities,"The response of numerical methods to flow properties dynamic changes is a key ingredient of numerical modeling calibration. In this context, a range of spectral analyses and canonical fluid mechanics problems are explored to compare the responses of the high-order spectral difference scheme and of the flux reconstruction methods. Spatial eigen-analysis (Hu et al. in J Comput Phys 151(2):921–946, 1999; Hu and Atkins in J Comput Phys 182(2):516–545, 2002), based on spatially evolving oscillations, is used to get useful insights for problems with inflow/outflow boundary conditions (i.e., non-periodic), while non-modal analysis (Fernandez et al. in Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 346:43–62, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2018.11.027) focusses on the short-term dynamics of the discretised system. These two approaches are also extended to the general scalar conservation law with non-constant advection velocity. All these tools are used to obtain more insight about the expected behavior of the mentioned numerical methods for typical engineering applications. On this regard, despite the lack of a mathematical proof of stability in the non-linear case, the selected numerical schemes, for which an extensive literature is available for applications to Euler and Navier–Stokes equations, will be assumed to be stable. Findings are then verified considering one-dimensional linear advection, and two- and three-dimensional flows modeled with the compressible Euler equations. Implications in the accurate control of numerical dissipation for turbulent flows is also addressed. Within the context of high-order methods, this work complement the former temporal spectral analyses of the discontinuous Galerkin approach discretising the linear advection equation.","Niccolò Tonicello

We use the method of projected boundaries to reduce the connecting orbit problem to a finite dimensional zero finding problem for a high dimensional map. We refer to this map as the connecting orbit operator. We study one parameter branches of zeros for the connecting orbit operator using existing methods of computer assisted proof know as the radii-polynomial approach and validated continuation. The local stable/unstable manifolds of the fixed points are analyzed using validated numerical methods based on the parameterization method. The validated branches of zeros found using our argument correspond to continuous families of transverse connecting orbits for the original dynamical system. Validation of a saddle node bifurcations for the connecting orbit operator correspond to a proof of existence for a tangency.

Partial integro-differential equation satisfied by the option value is derived by delta-hedge method, which is a nonlinear Black–Scholes equation with an infinite integral, and it is difficult to obtain the analytic solution. Based on a nonstandard approximation of the second partial derivative, a double discretization strategy is introduced for the unbounded part of the spatial domain and a positivity-preserving numerical scheme is developed. The scheme is not only unconditionally stable and positive, but also allows us to solve the discrete equation explicitly, and after modifying it becomes consistent. The numerical results for European call option and digital call option are compared to the standard finite difference scheme. It turns out that the proposed scheme is efficient and reliable.","Shengwu Zhou1, Lei Han1, Wei Li2, Yan Zhang1 & …Miao Han",Computational and Applied Mathematics,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-014-0156-5,"Option pricing,Jump-diffusion process,Nonstandard scheme, Transaction costs"

Being motivated by ecological problems such as habitat fragmentation and alien species introduction (biological invasions), here we consider the RTE on a bounded domain with the goal to reveal the dependence of the critical domain size (that separates extinction from persistence) on biologically meaningful parameters of the equation. Since an analytical study does not seem to be possible, we investigate into this critical domain problem by means of computer simulations using an advanced numerical algorithm. We show that the population dynamics described by the RTE is significantly different from those of the corresponding reaction–diffusion equation. The properties of the critical domain are revealed accordingly.","Eliandro Cirilo2, Sergei Petrovskii1,3, Neyva Romeiro2 & …Paulo Natti",International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40819-019-0633-z,"Telegraph equation,Quasi-non-linear scheme,New numerical modelling,Critical lengths"

57,Slow nonisothermal flows: Numerical and asymptotic analysis of the Boltzmann equation,"Slow flows of a slightly rarefied gas under high thermal stresses are considered. The correct fluid-dynamic description of this class of flows is based on the Kogan–Galkin–Friedlander equations, containing some non-Navier–Stokes terms in the momentum equation. Appropriate boundary conditions are determined from the asymptotic analysis of the Knudsen layer on the basis of the Boltzmann equation. Boundary conditions up to the second order of the Knudsen number are studied. Some two-dimensional examples are examined for the comparative analysis. The fluid-dynamic results are supported by numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation obtained by the Tcheremissine’s projection-interpolation discrete-velocity method extended for nonuniform grids. The competition pattern between the first- and the second-order nonlinear thermal-stress flows has been obtained for the first time.","O. A.

58,Analysis and comparison of numerical methods for the Klein–Gordon equation in the nonrelativistic limit regime,"We analyze rigourously error estimates and compare numerically temporal/spatial resolution of various numerical methods for solving the Klein–Gordon (KG) equation in the nonrelativistic limit regime, involving a small parameter \({0 < {\varepsilon}\ll 1}\) which is inversely proportional to the speed of light. In this regime, the solution is highly oscillating in time, i.e. there are propagating waves with wavelength of \({O({\varepsilon}^2)}\) and O(1) in time and space, respectively. We begin with four frequently used finite difference time domain (FDTD) methods and obtain their rigorous error estimates in the nonrelativistic limit regime by paying particularly attention to how error bounds depend explicitly on mesh size h and time step τ as well as the small parameter \({{\varepsilon}}\). Based on the error bounds, in order to compute ‘correct’ solutions when \({0 < {\varepsilon}\ll1}\), the four FDTD methods share the same \({{\varepsilon}}\)-scalability: \({\tau=O({\varepsilon}^3)}\). Then we propose new numerical methods by using either Fourier pseudospectral or finite difference approximation for spatial derivatives combined with the Gautschi-type exponential integrator for temporal derivatives to discretize the KG equation. The new methods are unconditionally stable and their \({{\varepsilon}}\) -scalability is improved to τ = O(1) and \({\tau=O({\varepsilon}^2)}\) for linear and nonlinear KG equations, respectively, when \({0 < {\varepsilon}\ll1}\).

Most numerical scientific computation today is performed with double-precision floating-point accuracy (64-bit or \(\sim \)15 decimal digits); however, there are a number of applications that benefit from a higher level of numerical precision. In this paper, we describe such an application in the research area of black hole physics: studying the late-time behavior of decaying fields in Kerr black hole space-time. More specifically, this application involves a hyperbolic partial-differential-equation solver that uses high-order finite-differencing and quadruple (128-bit or \(\sim \)30 decimal digits) or octal (256-bit or \(\sim \)60 decimal digits) floating-point precision. Given the computational demands of this high-order and high-precision solver, in addition to the rather long evolutions required for these studies, we accelerate the solver using a many-core Nvidia graphics-processing-unit and obtain an order-of-magnitude speed-up over a high-end multi-core processor.

61,On the Controllability of an Advection-diffusion Equation with Respect to the Diffusion Parameter: Asymptotic Analysis and Numerical Simulations,"The advection-diffusion equation yεt − εyεxx + Myεx = 0, (x, t) ∈ (0, 1) × (0, T) is null controllable for any strictly positive values of the diffusion coefficient ε and of the controllability time T. We discuss here the behavior of the cost of control when the coefficient ε goes to zero, according to the values of T. It is actually known that this cost is uniformly bounded with respect to ε if T is greater than a minimal time TM, with TM in the interval \(\left[ {1,2\sqrt 3 } \right]/M\) for M > 0 and in the interval \(\left[ {2\sqrt 2 ,2\left( {1 + \sqrt 3 } \right)} \right]/|M|\) for M< 0. The exact value of TM is however unknown.We investigate in this work the determination of the minimal time TM employing two distincts but complementary approaches. In a first one, we numerically estimate the cost of controllability, reformulated as the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem for the underlying control operator, with respect to the parameter T and ε. This allows notably to exhibit the structure of initial data leading to large costs of control. At the practical level, this evaluation requires the non trivial and challenging approximation of null controls for the advection-diffusion equation. In the second approach, we perform an asymptotic analysis, with respect to the parameter ε, of the optimality system associated to the control of minimal L2-norm.

62,Analysis and numerical solution of a nonlinear variable-order fractional differential equation,"We prove the wellposedness of a nonlinear variable-order fractional differential equation and the regularity of its solutions. The regularity of the solutions is determined solely by the values of the variable order and its high-order derivatives at time t = 0 (in addition to the usual regularity assumptions on the variable order and the coefficients). If the variable-order reduces to an integer order at t = 0, then the solution has full regularity as the solution to a first-order ordinary differential equation. In this case, we prove that the corresponding finite difference scheme discretized on a uniform mesh has an optimal-order convergence rate. However, if the variable order does not reduce to an integer order at t = 0, then the solution has a singularity at time t = 0, as Stynes et al. proved in [15] for the constant-order time-fractional diffusion equations. The corresponding finite difference scheme discretized on a uniform mesh has only a suboptimal-order convergence rate. Instead, we prove that the finite difference scheme discretized on a graded mesh determined by the value of the variable order at time t = 0 has an optimal-order convergence rate in terms of the number of the time steps. Numerical experiments substantiate these theoretical results.",Hong Wang1 & Xiangcheng Zheng,Advances in Computational Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-019-09690-0,"Regularity of solution,Finite difference method,Optimal-order error estimate,Graded mesh"

66,Numerical exterior algebra and the compound matrix method," The compound matrix method, which was first proposed for numerically integrating systems of differential equations in hydrodynamic stability on k=2,3 dimensional subspaces of \({\mathbb C}^n\), by using compound matrices as coordinates, is reformulated in a coordinate-free way using exterior algebra spaces, \(\bigwedge^{k}({\mathbb C}^n)\).This formulation leads to a general framework for studying systems of differential equations on k-dimensional subspaces. The framework requires the development of several new ideas: the role of Hodge duality and the Hodge star operator in the construction, an efficient strategy for constructing the induced differential equations on \(\bigwedge^{k}({\mathbb C}^n)\), general formulation of induced boundary conditions, the role of geometric integrators for preserving the manifold of k-dimensional subspaces – the Grassmann manifold, \(G_k({\mathbb C}^n)\), and a formulation for induced systems on an unbounded interval.The numerical exterior algebra framework is most advantageous for numerical solution of differential eigenvalue problems on unbounded domains, where there are significant difficulties in setting up matrix discretizations.The formulation is presented for k-dimensional subspaces of systems on \({\mathbb C}^n\) with k and n arbitrary, and examples are given for the cases of k=2 and n=4, and k=3 and n=6, with an indication of implementation details for systems of larger dimension.The theory is illustrated by application to four differential eigenvalue problems on unbounded intervals: hydrodynamic stablity of boundary-layer flow past a compliant surface, the eigenvalue problem associated with the stability of solitary waves, the stability of Bickley jet in oceanography, and the eigenvalue problem associated with the stability of the Ekman layer in atmospheric dynamics.",Leanne Allen1 & Thomas J.

The proof is constructive and provides explicit bounds for the inclusion of the solution of the Cauchy problem, which is rewritten as a zero-finding problem on a certain Banach space. Using a solution map operator, we construct a simplified Newton operator and show that it has a unique fixed point. The fixed point together with its rigorous bounds provides the local inclusion of the solution of the Cauchy problem. The local inclusion technique is then applied iteratively to compute solutions over long time intervals. This technique is used to prove the existence of a branching singularity in the nonlinear heat equation. Finally, we introduce an approach based on the Lyapunov–Perron method for calculating part of a center-stable manifold and prove that an open set of solutions of the Cauchy problem converge to zero, hence yielding the global existence of the solutions in the complex plane of time.","Akitoshi Takayasu1, Jean-Philippe Lessard2, Jonathan Jaquette3 nAff4 & …Hisashi Okamoto",Numerische Mathematik,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-022-01291-2,"35A20,35B40,35B44,35K55,65G40,65M15,65M70"

76,A Survey on Numerical Methods for Spectral Space-Fractional Diffusion Problems,"The survey is devoted to numerical solution of the equation Aαu = f, 0 > α > 1, where A is a symmetric positive definite operator corresponding to a second order elliptic boundary value problem in a bounded domain Ω in Rd. The fractional power Aα is a non-local operator and is defined though the spectrum of A. Due to growing interest and demand in applications of sub-diffusion models to physics and engineering, in the last decade, several numerical approaches have been proposed, studied, and tested. We consider discretizations of the elliptic operator A by using an N-dimensional finite element space Vh or finite differences over a uniform mesh with N points. In the case of finite element approximation we get a symmetric and positive definite operator Ah: Vh → Vh, which results in an operator equation Aαhuh = fh for uh ∈ Vh.The numerical solution of this equation is based on the following three equivalent representations of the solution: (1) Dunford-Taylor integral formula (or its equivalent Balakrishnan formula, (2.5)), (2) extension of the a second order elliptic problem in Ω×(0,∞) ⊂ Rd+1 [17, 55] (with a local operator) or as a pseudo-parabolic equation in the cylinder (x, t) ∈ Ω×(0, 1), [70, 29], (3) spectral representation (2.6) and the best uniform rational approximation (BURA) of zα on [0, 1], [37, 40].

77,Numerical Study of Low Rank Approximation Methods for Mechanics Data and Its Analysis,"This paper proposes a comparison of the numerical aspect and efficiency of several low rank approximation techniques for multidimensional data, namely CPD, HOSVD, TT-SVD, RPOD, QTT-SVD and HT. This approach is different from the numerous papers that compare the theoretical aspects of these methods or propose efficient implementation of a single technique. Here, after a brief presentation of the studied methods, they are tested in practical conditions in order to draw hindsight at which one should be preferred. Synthetic data provides sufficient evidence for dismissing CPD, T-HOSVD and RPOD. Then, three examples from mechanics provide data for realistic application of TT-SVD and ST-HOSVD. The obtained low rank approximation provides different levels of compression and accuracy depending on how separable the data is. In all cases, the data layout has significant influence on the analysis of modes and computing time while remaining similarly efficient at compressing information. Both methods provide satisfactory compression, from 0.1% to 20% of the original size within a few percent error in \(L^2\) norm. ST-HOSVD provides an orthonormal basis while TT-SVD doesn’t. QTT is performing well only when one dimension is very large. A final experiment is applied to an order 7 tensor with \((4 \times 8\times 8\times 64\times 64\times 64\times 64)\) entries (32 GB) from complex multi-physics experiment. In that case, only HT provides actual compression (50%) due to the low separability of this data. However, it is better suited for higher order d.

The approach is based on feedback necessary optimality condition laying in the formalism of the Pontryagin maximum principle (employing only the related standard constructions), but involving feedback control variations of an “extremal” structure. We make a “double reduction” of the impulsive control problem: first, we perform a well-known equivalent transform of the measure-driven system to an ordinary terminally-constrained control system and, second, pass to its discrete-time counterpart. For the resulted discrete control problem, we present a necessary condition of global optimality called the discrete feedback maximum principle. Based on this optimality condition, we elaborate a nonlocal numeric algorithm, which can, potentially, improve nonoptimal extrema of the discrete maximum principle. Due to a specific structure of the investigated model, the algorithm admits a deep specification. As an illustration of our approach, we present a numeric implementation of an academic example—a singular version of a generalized Sethi–Thompson investment problem from mathematical economics.","Stepan P.

The finite difference method is applied to obtain the linear system of equations and the temperature at each node of the domain. The numerical code is implemented in the free software package GNU Octave. In the first part, a mesh independency study is carried on in order to establish a relation between accuracy and computational cost, comparing the simulated results with results from an approximate analytical solution available in the literature. It is observed excellent agreement between numerical and the analytical results. In the second part, an analysis of the overall order of the numerical scheme is carried on by considering numerical solutions for three different meshes and different formulations of the boundary conditions. Results show that the overall order of the numerical scheme is first-order even if full second-order discretization scheme is applied for all grid points, due to the presence of the discrete heat source. Those results are observed for the considered discretization schemes and are confirmed after using a continuous formulation for the heat source term.","Matheus dos Santos Guzella1, Luben Cabezas-Gómez2 & Luiz Gustavo Monteiro Guimarães",International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40819-015-0091-1,"Finite difference method,Numerical simulation,Temperature field,Thermoelectric coolers"

98,Mathematical modelling and numerical simulations of actin dynamics in the eukaryotic cell,"The aim of this article is to study cell deformation and cell movement by considering both the mechanical and biochemical properties of the cortical network of actin filaments and its concentration. Actin is a polymer that can exist either in filamentous form (F-actin) or in monometric form (G-actin) (Chen et al. in Trends Biochem Sci 25:19–23, 2000) and the filamentous form is arranged in a paired helix of two protofilaments (Ananthakrishnan et al. in Recent Res Devel Biophys 5:39–69, 2006). By assuming that cell deformations are a result of the cortical actin dynamics in the cell cytoskeleton, we consider a continuum mathematical model that couples the mechanics of the network of actin filaments with its bio-chemical dynamics. Numerical treatment of the model is carried out using the moving grid finite element method (Madzvamuse et al. in J Comput Phys 190:478–500, 2003). Furthermore, by assuming slow deformations of the cell, we use linear stability theory to validate the numerical simulation results close to bifurcation points. Far from bifurcation points, we show that the mathematical model is able to describe the complex cell deformations typically observed in experimental results. Our numerical results illustrate cell expansion, cell contraction, cell translation and cell relocation as well as cell protrusions. In all these results, the contractile tonicity formed by the association of actin filaments to the myosin II motor proteins is identified as a key bifurcation parameter.","Uduak Z.

An approximation of higher order of accuracy is used to construct an iterative difference spline scheme and to obtain a numerical solution of the third-order equation subject to certain relationships between the two small parameters and the space and time increments. The behavior of the solution of the boundary-value problem is investigated for various parameters at the second and third derivative and for various time and space increments of the difference grid.

After analysing and comparing the numerical dissipation and dispersion of various schemes, a new kind of limiter is proposed.

It is proposed to use a Shishkin grid to obtain a relative error of the formulas that is independent of a small parameter. Error estimates that depend on the number of nodes of the difference formulas for a derivative of a given order are obtained.

138, The life-span of backward error analysis for numerical integrators," Backward error analysis is a useful tool for the study of numerical approximations to ordinary differential equations. The numerical solution is formally interpreted as the exact solution of a perturbed differential equation, given as a formal and usually divergent series in powers of the step size. For a rigorous analysis, this series has to be truncated.
 In this article we study the influence of this truncation to the difference between the numerical solution and the exact solution of the perturbed differential equation. Results on the long-time behaviour of numerical solutions are obtained in this way. We present applications to the numerical phase portrait near hyperbolic equilibrium points, to asymptotically stable periodic orbits and Hopf bifurcation, and to energy conservation and approximation of invariant tori in Hamiltonian systems.

139,Numerical analysis for viscoelastic fluid flow with distributed/variable order time fractional Maxwell constitutive models,"Fractional calculus has been widely used to study the flow of viscoelastic fluids recently, and fractional differential equations have attracted a lot of attention. However, the research has shown that the fractional equation with constant order operators has certain limitations in characterizing some physical phenomena. In this paper, the viscoelastic fluid flow of generalized Maxwell fluids in an infinite straight pipe driven by a periodic pressure gradient is investigated systematically. Consider the complexity of the material structure and multi-scale effects in the viscoelastic fluid flow. The modified time fractional Maxwell models and the corresponding governing equations with distributed/variable order time fractional derivatives are proposed. Based on the L1-approximation formula of Caputo fractional derivatives, the implicit finite difference schemes for the distributed/variable order time fractional governing equations are presented, and the numerical solutions are derived. In order to test the correctness and availability of numerical schemes, two numerical examples are established to give the exact solutions. The comparisons between the numerical solutions and the exact solutions have been made, and their high consistency indicates that the present numerical methods are effective. Then, this paper analyzes the velocity distributions of the distributed/variable order fractional Maxwell governing equations under specific conditions, and discusses the effects of the weight coefficient ϖ(α) in distributed order time fractional derivatives, the order α(r, t) in variable fractional order derivatives, the relaxation time λ, and the frequency ω of the periodic pressure gradient on the fluid flow velocity.

The spatial domain of the equation is expressed as a collection of overlapping subdomains and the solution of an associated equation is solved on each of these subdomains. The global solution is then obtained by piecing together the subsolutions in some manner. For elliptic equations, the global solution is obtained by iterating on the subdomains in a fashion that resembles the classical Schwarz alternating method. In this paper, we examine the convergence behavior of different subdomain iteration procedures as well as different subdomain approximations. For elliptic equations, it is shown that certain iterative procedures are equivalent to block Gauss-Siedel and Jacobi methods.

The aim of this paper is the accurate numerical study of the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (KP) equation. In particular, we are concerned with the small dispersion limit of this model, where no comprehensive analytical description exists so far. To this end, we first study a similar highly oscillatory regime for asymptotically small solutions, which can be described via the Davey–Stewartson system. In a second step, we investigate numerically the small dispersion limit of the KP model in the case of large amplitudes. Similarities and differences to the much better studied Korteweg–de Vries situation are discussed as well as the dependence of the limit on the additional transverse coordinate.

150,Analysis of Error Growth Via Stability Regions in Numerical Initial Value Problems,"This paper concerns the stability analysis of numerical methods for solving time dependent ordinary and partial differential equations. In the literature stability estimates for such methods were derived, under a condition which can be viewed as a transplantation of the Kreiss resolvent condition (from the unit disk to the stability region S of the numerical method). These estimates tell us that errors in the numerical time stepping process cannot grow faster than linearly with min {s,n}. Here n denotes the number of time steps, and s stands for the order of the (spatial discretization) matrices involved.In this paper we address the natural question of whether the above stability estimates can be improved so as to imply an error growth at a slower rate than min {s,n} (when n→∞, s→∞). Our results concerning this question are as follows: (a) for all (practical) Runge–Kutta and other one-step formulas, we show that the estimates from the literature are sharp in that error growth at the rate min {s,n} can actually occur, (b) for linear multistep formulas we find that, rather surprisingly, some of the stability estimates can substantially be improved and extended, whereas others are sharp.The results proved in this paper are also relevant to (suitably scaled spatial discretization) matrices whose ε-pseudo-eigenvalues lie at a distance not exceeding Kε from the stability region S of the time stepping method, for all ε>0 and fixed constant K.",K.

We also discuss adaptive coarse-graining schemes which have the capacity of automatically adjusting during the simulation if substantial deviations are detected in a suitable error indicator.

152,On the Numerical Stability of Fourier Extensions,"An effective means to approximate an analytic, nonperiodic function on a bounded interval is by using a Fourier series on a larger domain. When constructed appropriately, this so-called Fourier extension is known to converge geometrically fast in the truncation parameter. Unfortunately, computing a Fourier extension requires solving an ill-conditioned linear system, and hence one might expect such rapid convergence to be destroyed when carrying out computations in finite precision. The purpose of this paper is to show that this is not the case. Specifically, we show that Fourier extensions are actually numerically stable when implemented in finite arithmetic, and achieve a convergence rate that is at least superalgebraic. Thus, in this instance, ill-conditioning of the linear system does not prohibit a good approximation.In the second part of this paper we consider the issue of computing Fourier extensions from equispaced data. A result of Platte et al. (SIAM Rev. 53(2):308–318, 2011) states that no method for this problem can be both numerically stable and exponentially convergent. We explain how Fourier extensions relate to this theoretical barrier, and demonstrate that they are particularly well suited for this problem: namely, they obtain at least superalgebraic convergence in a numerically stable manner.","Ben Adcock1, Daan Huybrechs2 & Jesús Martín-Vaquero",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-013-9158-8,"Fourier series,Fourier extension,Convergence,Stability,Equispaced data"

We study the long-time numerical energy conservation not only for symmetric integrators but also for symplectic integrators. In the analysis, we neither assume symplecticity for symmetric methods, nor assume symmetry for symplectic methods. It turns out that these both types of integrators have a near conservation of the total and oscillatory energy over a long term. To prove the result for explicit integrators, a relationship between ERKN integrators and trigonometric integrators is established. For the long-term analysis of implicit integrators, the above approach does not work anymore and we use the technology of modulated Fourier expansion.

160,An analysis of the effect of rounding errors on the flow of control in numerical processes,"Rounding errors may change the flow of control in numerical computing processes by leading to changes in some branching decisions of the process.

The approach is based on a model of numerical computation related to program schemes. Each computing process specified by the model computes a partial functionR
n →R
m using rational operations and simple tests on real numbers. The topological structure of input point sets inR
n on which the computation follows the same execution path is studied. We also investigate input points, called sensitive, on which rounding errors may change the execution path followed. Conditions concerning computing processes are given which guarantee that the Lebesgue measure of sensitive points approaches zero (i.e. the probability of a branching error gets arbitrarily small) as the precision of the arithmetic increases. Most numerical processes used in practice are easily seen to satisfy these conditions.",Esko Ukkonen,BIT Numerical Mathematics,1979,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01931229,"Real Number,Numerical Computation,Computational Mathematic,Theoretical Result,Lebesgue Measure"

162,Numerical stability of GMRES,"The Generalized Minimal Residual Method (GMRES) is one of the significant methods for solving linear algebraic systems with nonsymmetric matrices. It minimizes the norm of the residual on the linear variety determined by the initial residual and then-th Krylov residual subspace and is therefore optimal, with respect to the size of the residual, in the class of Krylov subspace methods. One possible way of computing the GMRES approximations is based on constructing the orthonormal basis of the Krylov subspaces (Arnoldi basis) and then solving the transformed least squares problem. This paper studies the numerical stability of such formulations of GMRES. Our approach is based on the Arnoldi recurrence for the actually, i.e., in finite precision arithmetic, computed quantities. We consider the Householder (HHA), iterated modified Gram-Schmidt (IMGSA), and iterated classical Gram-Schmidt (ICGSA) implementations. Under the obvious assumption on the numerical nonsingularity of the system matrix, the HHA implementation of GMRES is proved backward stable in the normwise sense. That is, the backward error\(||b - A\tilde x||/(||A||{\text{ ||}}\tilde x|| + ||b||)\) for the approximation\(\tilde x\) is proportional to machine precision ε. Additionally, it is shown that in most cases the norm of the residual computed from the transformed least squares problem (Arnoldi residual) gives a good estimate of the true residual norm, until the true residual norm has reached the level ε‖A‖ ‖x‖.","J.

164,Asymptotic adaptive methods for multi-scale problems in fluid mechanics,"This paper reports on the results of a three-year research effort aimed at investigating and exploiting the role of physically motivated asymptotic analysis in the design of numerical methods for singular limit problems in fluid mechanics. Such problems naturally arise, among others, in combustion, magneto-hydrodynamics, and geophysical fluid mechanics. Typically, they are characterized by multiple-space and/or -time scales and by the disturbing fact that standard computational techniques fail entirely, are unacceptably expensive, or both. The challenge here is to construct numerical methods which are robust, uniformly accurate, and efficient through different asymptotic regimes and over a wide range of relevant applications. Summaries of multiple-scales asymptotic analyses for low-Mach-number flows, magneto-hydrodynamics at small Mach and Alfvén numbers, and of multiple-scales atmospheric flows are provided. These reveal singular balances between selected terms in the respective governing equations within the considered flow regimes. These singularities give rise to problems of severe stiffness, stability, or to dynamic-range issues in straight-forward numerical discretizations. A formal mathematical framework for the multiple scales asymptotics is then summarized by use of the example of multiple-length-scale single-time-scale asymptotics for low-Mach-number flows. The remainder of the paper focuses on the construction of numerical discretizations for the respective full governing equation systems. These discretizations avoid the pitfalls of singular balances by exploiting the asymptotic results. Importantly, the asymptotics are not used here to derive simplified equation systems, which are then solved numerically. Rather, numerical integration of the full equation sets is aimed at and the asymptotics are used only to construct discretizations that do not deteriorate as a singular limit is approached. One important ingredient of this strategy is the numerical identification of a singular limit regime given a set of discrete numerical state variables. This problem is addressed in an exemplary fashion for multiple-length single-time-scale low-Mach-number flows in one space dimension. The strategy allows a dynamic determination of an instantaneous relevant Mach number, and it can thus be used to drive the appropriate adjustment of the numerical discretizations when the singular limit regime is approached.","R.

The thread of this paper is the following: involutive automorphisms on groups induce a factorization at a group level, and a splitting at the algebra level. In this paper we will give an introduction to the mathematical theory behind these constructions, and review recent results. Furthermore, we present a new Yoshida-like technique, for self-adjoint numerical schemes, that allows to increase the order of preservation of symmetries by two units.

167,A Wiener–Hopf based approach to numerical computations in fluctuation theory for Lévy processes,"This paper focuses on numerical evaluation techniques related to fluctuation theory for Lévy processes; they can be applied in various domains, e.g., in finance in the pricing of so-called barrier options. More specifically, with \(\bar{X}_t:= \sup _{0\le s\le t} X_s\) denoting the running maximum of the Lévy process \(X_t\), the aim is to evaluate \(\mathbb{P }(\bar{X}_t \in \mathrm{d}x)\) for \(t,x>0\). The starting point is the Wiener–Hopf factorization, which yields an expression for the transform \(\mathbb E e^{-\alpha \bar{X}_{e(\vartheta )}}\) of the running maximum at an exponential epoch (with \(\vartheta ^{-1}\) the mean of this exponential random variable). This expression is first rewritten in a more convenient form, and then it is pointed out how to use Laplace inversion techniques to numerically evaluate \(\mathbb{P }(\bar{X}_t\in \mathrm{d}x).\) In our experiments we rely on the efficient and accurate algorithm developed in den Iseger (Probab Eng Inf Sci 20:1–44, 2006). We illustrate the performance of the algorithm with various examples: Brownian motion (with drift), a compound Poisson process, and a jump diffusion process. In models with jumps, we are also able to compute the density of the first time a specific threshold is exceeded, jointly with the corresponding overshoot. The paper is concluded by pointing out how our algorithm can be used in order to analyze the Lévy process’ concave majorant.","Peter Den Iseger1, Paul Gruntjes2,3 & Michel Mandjes",Mathematical Methods of Operations Research,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00186-013-0434-9,"Wiener Hopf factorization,Laplace transform,Laplace inversion,Lévy processes,Concave majorant"
168,The hot spots conjecture can be false: some numerical examples,"The hot spots conjecture is only known to be true for special geometries. This paper shows numerically that the hot spots conjecture can fail to be true for easy to construct bounded domains with one hole. The underlying eigenvalue problem for the Laplace equation with Neumann boundary condition is solved with boundary integral equations yielding a non-linear eigenvalue problem. Its discretization via the boundary element collocation method in combination with the algorithm by Beyn yields highly accurate results both for the first non-zero eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenfunction which is due to superconvergence. Additionally, it can be shown numerically that the ratio between the maximal/minimal value inside the domain and its maximal/minimal value on the boundary can be larger than 1 + 10− 3. Finally, numerical examples for easy to construct domains with up to five holes are provided which fail the hot spots conjecture as well.","Andreas Kleefeld

169,"Finite Element Analysis of Attraction-Repulsion Chemotaxis System. Part II: Time Convergence, Error Analysis and Numerical Results","In Hashim and Harfash (Appl. Math. Comput. 2021), using a finite element method, the attraction-repulsion chemotaxis model \((\mathrm {P})\) in space is discretised; finite differences were used to do the same in time. Furthermore, the existence of a global weak solution to the system \((\mathrm {P}_{M} ^{\Delta t})\) was demonstrated by means of analysis of the convergence of the fully discrete approximate problem \((\mathrm {P}_{M, \varepsilon } ^{h, \Delta t} )\). Moreover, the functions \(\{U, Z, V\}\) were proved to represent a global weak solution to the system \((\mathrm {P}_{M} ^{\Delta t})\) by means of a passage to the limit \(\varepsilon , h \rightarrow 0\) of the approximate system. This paper’s purpose is to demonstrate that the solutions can be bounded, independent of M. The analysis contained in this paper illustrates the idea of the existence of weak solutions to the model \((\mathrm {P})\), that requires passing to the limits, \(\Delta t \rightarrow 0^{+}\) and \(M \rightarrow \infty \). The time step \(\Delta t\) is subsequently linked to the cutoff parameter \(M > 1\) by positing a demand that \(\Delta t=o(M^{-1})\), as \(M \rightarrow \infty \), with the result that the cutoff parameter becomes the only parameter in the problem \((\mathrm {P}_{M} ^{\Delta t})\). The solutions can be bounded, independent of M, with the use of special energy estimates, as demonstrated herein. Then, these M-independent bounds on the relative entropy are employed with the purpose of deriving M-independent bounds on the time-derivatives. Additionally, compactness arguments were utilised to explore the convergence of the finite element approximate problem. The conclusion was that a weak solution for \((\mathrm {P})\) existed. Finally, we introduced the error estimate and the implicit scheme was used to perform simulations in one and two space dimensions.",Mohammed Homod Hashim1 & Akil J.

170,Numerical Methods and Comparison for the Dirac Equation in the Nonrelativistic Limit Regime,"We analyze rigorously error estimates and compare numerically spatial/temporal resolution of various numerical methods for the discretization of the Dirac equation in the nonrelativistic limit regime, involving a small dimensionless parameter \(0<\varepsilon \ll 1\) which is inversely proportional to the speed of light. In this limit regime, the solution is highly oscillatory in time, i.e. there are propagating waves with wavelength \(O(\varepsilon ^2)\) and O(1) in time and space, respectively. We begin with several frequently used finite difference time domain (FDTD) methods and obtain rigorously their error estimates in the nonrelativistic limit regime by paying particular attention to how error bounds depend explicitly on mesh size h and time step \(\tau \) as well as the small parameter \(\varepsilon \). Based on the error bounds, in order to obtain ‘correct’ numerical solutions in the nonrelativistic limit regime, i.e. \(0<\varepsilon \ll 1\), the FDTD methods share the same \(\varepsilon \)-scalability on time step and mesh size as: \(\tau =O(\varepsilon ^3)\) and \(h=O(\sqrt{\varepsilon })\). Then we propose and analyze two numerical methods for the discretization of the Dirac equation by using the Fourier spectral discretization for spatial derivatives combined with the symmetric exponential wave integrator and time-splitting technique for temporal derivatives, respectively. Rigorous error bounds for the two numerical methods show that their \(\varepsilon \)-scalability is improved to \(\tau =O(\varepsilon ^2)\) and \(h=O(1)\) when \(0<\varepsilon \ll 1\). Extensive numerical results are reported to support our error estimates.","Weizhu Bao1, Yongyong Cai2,3, Xiaowei Jia1 & …Qinglin Tang",Journal of Scientific Computing,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-016-0333-3,"Dirac equation,Nonrelativistic limit regime,Finite difference time domain method,Symmetric exponential wave integrator,Time splitting,Spectral method,

171,O(dlog N)-Quantics Approximation of N-d Tensors in High-Dimensional Numerical Modeling,"In the present paper, we discuss the novel concept of super-compressed tensor-structured data formats in high-dimensional applications.

d, and to the respective discretized differential-integral operators in ℝd. As the basic approximation result, we prove that a complex exponential sampled on an equispaced grid has quantics rank 1. Moreover, a Chebyshev polynomial, sampled over a Chebyshev Gauss–Lobatto grid, has separation rank 2 in the quantics tensor format, while for the polynomial of degree m over a Chebyshev grid the respective quantics rank is at most 2m+1. For N-d tensors generated by certain analytic functions, we give a constructive proof of the O(dlog Nlog ε

We obtain the optimal \(L^2\) error estimate in space discretization for multi-dimensional problems. The convergence of the fast time-stepping numerical methods is also proved in a simple manner.

176,A posteriori error analysis and adaptive non-intrusive numerical schemes for systems of random conservation laws,"This article considers one-dimensional random systems of hyperbolic conservation laws. Existence and uniqueness of random entropy admissible solutions for initial value problems of conservation laws, which involve random initial data and random flux functions, are established. Based on these results an a posteriori error analysis for a numerical approximation of the random entropy solution is presented. For the stochastic discretization, a non-intrusive approach, namely the Stochastic Collocation method is used. The spatio-temporal discretization relies on the Runge–Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin method. The a posteriori estimator is derived using smooth reconstructions of the discrete solution. Combined with the relative entropy stability framework this yields computable error bounds for the entire space-stochastic discretization error. The estimator admits a splitting into a stochastic and a deterministic (space-time) part, allowing for a novel residual-based space-stochastic adaptive mesh refinement algorithm. The scaling properties of the residuals are investigated and the efficiency of the proposed adaptive algorithms is illustrated in various numerical examples.

177,Numerical methods for accurate computation of the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices and the singular values of general matrices,"This paper offers a review of numerical methods for computation of the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices and the singular values of general and some classes of structured matrices. The focus is on the main principles behind the methods that guarantee high accuracy even in the cases that are ill-conditioned for the conventional methods. First, it is shown that a particular structure of the errors in a finite precision implementation of an algorithm allows for a much better measure of sensitivity and that computation with high accuracy is possible despite a large classical condition number. Such structured errors incurred by finite precision computation are in some algorithms e.g. entry-wise or column-wise small, which is much better than the usually considered errors that are in general small only when measured in the Frobenius matrix norm. Specially tailored perturbation theory for such structured perturbations of Hermitian matrices guarantees much better bounds for the relative errors in the computed eigenvalues. Secondly, we review an unconventional approach to accurate computation of the singular values and eigenvalues of some notoriously ill-conditioned structured matrices, such as e.g. Cauchy, Vandermonde and Hankel matrices. The distinctive feature of accurate algorithms is using the intrinsic parameters that define such matrices to obtain a non-orthogonal factorization, such as the LDU factorization, and then computing the singular values of the product of thus computed factors. The state of the art software is discussed as well.","Zlatko Drmač

179,Validated Numerical Approximation of Stable Manifolds for Parabolic Partial Differential Equations,"This paper develops validated computational methods for studying infinite dimensional stable manifolds at equilibrium solutions of parabolic PDEs, synthesizing disparate errors resulting from numerical approximation. To construct our approximation, we decompose the stable manifold into three components: a finite dimensional slow component, a fast-but-finite dimensional component, and a strongly contracting infinite dimensional “tail”. We employ the parameterization method in a finite dimensional projection to approximate the slow-stable manifold, as well as the attached finite dimensional invariant vector bundles. This approximation provides a change of coordinates which largely removes the nonlinear terms in the slow stable directions. In this adapted coordinate system we apply the Lyapunov-Perron method, resulting in mathematically rigorous bounds on the approximation errors. As a result, we obtain significantly sharper bounds than would be obtained using only the linear approximation given by the eigendirections.

180,Asymptotic Analysis of First Passage Time Problems Inspired by Ecology,"A hybrid asymptotic–numerical method is formulated and implemented to accurately calculate the mean first passage time (MFPT) for the expected time needed for a predator to locate small patches of prey in a 2-D landscape. In our analysis, the movement of the predator can have both a random and a directed component, where the diffusivity of the predator is isotropic but possibly spatially heterogeneous. Our singular perturbation methodology, which is based on the assumption that the ratio \(\varepsilon \) of the radius of a typical prey patch to that of the overall landscape is asymptotically small, leads to the derivation of an algebraic system that determines the MFPT in terms of parameters characterizing the shapes of the small prey patches together with a certain Green’s function, which in general must be computed numerically. The expected error in approximating the MFPT by our semi-analytical procedure is smaller than any power of \({-1/\log \varepsilon }\), so that our approximation of the MFPT is still rather accurate at only moderately small prey patch radii. Overall, our hybrid approach has the advantage of eliminating the difficulty with resolving small spatial scales in a full numerical treatment of the partial differential equation (PDE). Similar semi-analytical methods are also developed and implemented to accurately calculate related quantities such as the variance of the mean first passage time (VMFPT) and the splitting probability.

181,Numerical modelling of a surface-stress driven density-stratified fluid,"The initial response of a density-stratified fluid in a rectangular domain to a surface stress is modelled numerically. The model is laminar, two-dimensional and non-hydrostatic. Upwelling of deep fluid at the upwind end of the fluid is critical to the subsequent evolution of the stratification. It is confirmed that upwelling is a wave process and consideration of flow at the upwind end-wall illustrates the flow structure of partial upwelling. Numerically, to ensure adequate penetration of surface stress, an increased viscosity is needed. Comparisons are made between the present numerical results and previously published experimental observations.",Duncan E. Farrow1 & Craig L.

182,Numerical integration of Hamiltonian problems by G-symplectic methods,"It is the purpose of this paper to consider the employ of General Linear Methods (GLMs) as geometric numerical solvers for the treatment of Hamiltonian problems. Indeed, even if the numerical flow generated by a GLM cannot be symplectic, we exploit here a concept of near conservation for such methods which, properly combined with other desirable features (such as symmetry and boundedness of parasitic components), allows to achieve an accurate conservation of the Hamiltonian. In this paper we focus our attention on the connection between order of convergence and Hamiltonian deviation by multivalue methods. Moreover, we derive a semi-implicit GLM which results competitive to symplectic Runge-Kutta methods, which are notoriously implicit.","Raffaele D’Ambrosio1, Giuseppe De Martino1 & Beatrice Paternoster",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-013-9318-z,"Hamiltonian problems,Geometric numerical integration,General Linear Methods,B-series methods,Symmetric methods,G-Symplectic methods"

            ","Averaging or gradient recovery techniques, which are a popular tool for improved convergence or superconvergence of finite element methods in elliptic partial differential equations, have not been recommended for nonconvex minimization problems as the energy minimization process enforces finer and finer oscillations and hence at the first glance, a smoothing step appears even counterproductive. For macroscopic quantities such as the stress field, however, this counterargument is no longer true. In fact, this paper advertises an averaging technique for a surprisingly improved convergence behavior for nonconvex minimization problems. Similar to a finite volume scheme, numerical experiments on a double-well benchmark example provide empirical evidence of superconvergence phenomena in macroscopic numerical simulations of oscillating microstructures.

184,Analysis of Atkinson’s variable transformation for numerical integration over smooth surfaces in ℝ3,"Recently, a variable transformation for integrals over smooth surfaces in ℝ3 was introduced in a paper by Atkinson. This interesting transformation, which includes a ‘‘grading’’ parameter that can be fixed by the user, makes it possible to compute these integrals numerically via the product trapezoidal rule in an efficient manner. Some analysis of the approximations thus produced was provided by Atkinson, who also stated some conjectures concerning the unusually fast convergence of his quadrature formulas observed for certain values of the grading parameter. In a recent report by Atkinson and Sommariva, this analysis is continued for the case in which the integral is over the surface of a sphere and the integrand is smooth over this surface, and optimal results are given for special values of the grading parameter. In the present work, we give a complete analysis of Atkinson’s method over arbitrary smooth surfaces that are homeomorphic to the surface of the unit sphere. We obtain optimal results that explain the actual rates of convergence, and we achieve this for all values of the grading parameter.",Avram Sidi,Numerische Mathematik,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-005-0605-6,"30E15,40A25,41A60,65B15,65D30,65D32"

Existence and uniqueness results are given for the sensitivities of a specific group of two-dimensional Navier-Stokes problems. We then turn our attention to obtaining numerical approximations to state sensitivities. We show convergence of our numerical sensitivities using a problem having an exact solution. Next, two problems, flow around a cylinder and flow over a bump, are used to evaluate several computational schemes. In particular, a local projection scheme for improved state derivative approximations and the use of an adaptive finite element scheme are shown to be important techniques for obtaining accurate sensitivity approximations.

The model is a limit case of the planar circular restricted 1 + n body problem, where an infinitesimal particle moves under the gravitational influence of a large central body and n smaller bodies located on the vertices of a regular n-gon. When considering n tending to infinity, a model depending on one parameter is obtained. We study the main important structures of the problem depending on this parameter (equilibria, Hill’s regions, linear stability, …). We use Poincaré maps, for different values of the parameter, in order to predict the width of the ring and the richness of the dynamics that occur is discussed.

188,Error estimates of numerical methods for the nonlinear Dirac equation in the nonrelativistic limit regime,"We present several numerical methods and establish their error estimates for the discretization of the nonlinear Dirac equation (NLDE) in the nonrelativistic limit regime, involving a small dimensionless parameter 0 < ε ≤ 1 which is inversely proportional to the speed of light. In this limit regime, the solution is highly oscillatory in time, i.e., there are propagating waves with wavelength O(ε
2) and O(1) in time and space, respectively. We begin with the conservative Crank-Nicolson finite difference (CNFD) method and establish rigorously its error estimate which depends explicitly on the mesh size h and time step τ as well as the small parameter 0 < ε ≤ 1. Based on the error bound, in order to obtain ‘correct’ numerical solutions in the nonrelativistic limit regime, i.e., 0 < ε ≤ 1, the CNFD method requests the ε-scalability: τ = O(ε
3) and \(h = O\left( {\sqrt \varepsilon } \right)\). Then we propose and analyze two numerical methods for the discretization of NLDE by using the Fourier spectral discretization for spatial derivatives combined with the exponential wave integrator and time-splitting technique for temporal derivatives, respectively. Rigorous error bounds for the two numerical methods show that their ε-scalability is improved to τ = O(ε

Extensive numerical results are reported to confirm our error estimates.","WeiZhu Bao1, YongYong Cai2,3, XiaoWei Jia1 & …Jia Yin",Science China Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-016-0272-y,"nonlinear Dirac equation,nonrelativistic limit regime,Crank-Nicolson finite difference method,exponential wave integrator,time splitting,spectral method,

We propose a twofold approach, by analysis and computing to deal with hysteretic, two-phase flows in porous media. First, we introduce a new analytical projection method for construction of the wave sequence in the Riemann problem for the system of equations for a prototype two-phase flow model via relaxation. Second, a new computational method is formally developed to corroborate our analysis along with a representative set of numerical experiments to improve the understanding of the fundamental relaxation modeling of hysteresis for two-phase flows. Using the projection method we show the existence by analytical construction of the solution. The proposed computational method is based on combining locally conservative hybrid finite element method and finite volume discretizations within an operator splitting formulation to address effectively the stiff relaxation hysteretic system modeling fundamental two-phase flows in porous media.","Eduardo Abreu1, Abel Bustos2, Paola Ferraz1 & …Wanderson Lambert",Journal of Scientific Computing,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-019-00923-4,"Hyperbolic conservation laws,Riemann problem,Projection method,Relaxation,Hysteretic two-phase flow,Finite volume/element"

The structure itself was an extended version of a famous design often attributed to Serlio, but first sketched much earlier by Villard de Honnecourt. The extended structure was also sketched by Leonardo da Vinci. Wallis’s analysis is remarkable for the fact that he systematically (and correctly) solved a set of 25 simultaneous equations to obtain the required forces.

But as yet, there are few results on the numerical computation of those bifurcations. The methods we present in this paper are a first step toward a systematic numerical analysis of generic bifurcations of Hamiltonian symmetric periodic orbits and relative periodic orbits (RPOs). First, we show how to numerically exploit spatio-temporal symmetries of Hamiltonian periodic orbits. Then we describe a general method for the numerical computation of RPOs persisting from periodic orbits in a symmetry breaking bifurcation. Finally, we present an algorithm for the numerical continuation of non-degenerate Hamiltonian relative periodic orbits with regular drift-momentum pair. Our path following algorithm is based on a multiple shooting algorithm for the numerical computation of periodic orbits via an adaptive Poincaré section and a tangential continuation method with implicit reparametrization.

For some classic examples for the viscous Burgers’ equation, simulation outcomes are validated through comparison with exact solutions for small and large values of kinematic viscosity. Numerical results from the NSFD schemes and corresponding standard finite difference methods are tabulated and compared with results from some existing methods. The proposed schemes give relatively accurate results, with comparatively less observed absolute errors.

216,On the balancing principle for some problems of Numerical Analysis,"We discuss a choice of weight in penalization methods. The motivation for the use of penalization in computational mathematics is to improve the conditioning of the numerical solution. One example of such improvement is a regularization, where a penalization substitutes an ill-posed problem for a well-posed one. In modern numerical methods for PDEs a penalization is used, for example, to enforce a continuity of an approximate solution on non-matching grids. A choice of penalty weight should provide a balance between error components related with convergence and stability, which are usually unknown. In this paper we propose and analyze a simple adaptive strategy for the choice of penalty weight which does not rely on a priori estimates of above mentioned components. It is shown that under natural assumptions the accuracy provided by our adaptive strategy is worse only by a constant factor than one could achieve in the case of known stability and convergence rates. Finally, we successfully apply our strategy for self-regularization of Volterra-type severely ill-posed problems, such as the sideways heat equation, and for the choice of a weight in interior penalty discontinuous approximation on non-matching grids. Numerical experiments on a series of model problems support theoretical results.","Raytcho D. Lazarov1, Shuai Lu2 & Sergei V.

219,Analysis of Finite Elasto-Plastic Strains: Integration Algorithm and Numerical Examples,"The paper is devoted to the development of a calculation technique for elasto-plastic solids with regard to finite strains. The kinematics of elasto-plastic strains is based on the multiplicative decomposition of the total deformation gradient into elastic and inelastic (plastic) components. The stress state is described by the Cauchy stress tensor. Physical relations are obtained from the equation of the second law of thermodynamics supplemented with a free energy function. The free energy function is written in an invariant form of the left Cauchy–Green elastic strain tensor. An elasto-plasticity model with isotropic strain hardening is considered. Based on an analog of the associated rule of plastic flows and the von Mises yield criterion, we develop the method of stress projection onto the yield surface (known as the radial return method) with an iterative refinement of the current stress-strain state. The iterative procedure is based on the introduction of additional virtual stresses to the resolving power equation. The constitutive relations for the rates and increments of the true Cauchy stresses are constructed. In terms of the incremental loading method, the variational equation is obtained on the basis of the principle of possible virtual powers. Spatial discretization is based on the finite element method; an octanodal finite element is used.We present the solution to the problem of tension of a circular bar and give a comparison with results of other authors.",L.

223,Numerical Bifurcation Analysis of PDEs From Lattice Boltzmann Model Simulations: a Parsimonious Machine Learning Approach,"We address a three-tier data-driven approach for the numerical solution of the inverse problem in Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and for their numerical bifurcation analysis from spatio-temporal data produced by Lattice Boltzmann model simulations using machine learning. In the first step, we exploit manifold learning and in particular parsimonious Diffusion Maps using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to both identify the intrinsic dimension of the manifold where the emergent dynamics evolve and for feature selection over the parameter space. In the second step, based on the selected features, we learn the right-hand-side of the effective PDEs using two machine learning schemes, namely shallow Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) with two hidden layers and single-layer Random Projection Networks (RPNNs), which basis functions are constructed using an appropriate random sampling approach. Finally, based on the learned black-box PDE model, we construct the corresponding bifurcation diagram, thus exploiting the numerical bifurcation analysis toolkit. For our illustrations, we implemented the proposed method to perform numerical bifurcation analysis of the 1D FitzHugh-Nagumo PDEs from data generated by D1Q3 Lattice Boltzmann simulations. The proposed method was quite effective in terms of numerical accuracy regarding the construction of the coarse-scale bifurcation diagram. Furthermore, the proposed RPNN scheme was \(\sim \) 20 to 30 times less costly regarding the training phase than the traditional shallow FNNs, thus arising as a promising alternative to deep learning for the data-driven numerical solution of the inverse problem for high-dimensional PDEs.","Evangelos Galaris1, Gianluca Fabiani2, Ioannis Gallos3, Ioannis Kevrekidis4 & …Constantinos Siettos

The effect of threshold number \(R_{1}\) holds in the stochastic dengue epidemic model. If \(R_{1} <1\), then situation helps us to control the disease while \(R_{1} >1\) shows the persistence of disease in population. Unfortunately, the numerical methods like Euler–Maruyama, stochastic Euler, and stochastic Runge–Kutta do not work for large time step sizes.

It is shown that any solution of such a problem can be expressed in terms of solutions to two associated weakly singular Volterra integral equations of the second kind. As a consequence, existence and uniqueness of a solution to the boundary value problem are proved, the structure of this solution is elucidated, and sharp bounds on its derivatives (in terms of the parameter δ) are derived. These results show that in general the first-order derivative of the solution will blow up at x = 0, so accurate numerical solution of this class of problems is not straightforward.

We derive the computational cost of the simulation implied by a precision criterion on the numerical simulation (maximum allowed error in phase or group velocity). We conclude that for moderate accuracy the staggered scheme of second order in time is more efficient, whereas for very precise simulation the compact scheme of fourth order in time is a better choice. The comparison increasingly favors the lower order staggered scheme as the dimension increases.

The case of high-contrast conducting media is considered in detail, with a conducting nonhomogeneity embedded in a poorly conducting medium. Numerical analysis of the integral equation in this case shows that the solution has low accuracy if a traditional uniform rectangular grid is superposed on the nonhomogeneity and the electric field is evaluated at nodes traditionally placed at the centers of the grid cells. In this approach, nothing is done to resolve the field behavior at the nonhomogeneity boundary in the belied that the boundary conditions will be satisfied on their own automatically. Even the introduction of enhanced background conductivity does not improve the accuracy. A much better result is obtained when enhanced background conductivity is combined with a special nonuniform grid in which the cells in the top grid row have reduced height and the nodes are placed at the top boundary of these cells.

242,A frictionless contact problem for elastic–viscoplastic materials with normal compliance: Numerical analysis and computational experiments," In this paper we consider a frictionless contact problem between an elastic–viscoplastic body and an obstacle. The process is assumed to be quasistatic and the contact is modeled with normal compliance. We present a variational formulation of the problem and prove the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution, using strongly monotone operators arguments and Banach's fixed point theorem. We also study the numerical approach to the problem using spatially semi-discrete and fully discrete finite elements schemes with implicit and explicit discretization in time. We show the existence of the unique solution for each of the schemes and derive error estimates on the approximate solutions.

The simulation is based on the equations of motion of an inviscid fluid (Euler equations). The influence exerted on the flow stability by physical parameters of the problem (such as the gap width between the cylinders, the initial perturbation, and the velocity difference between the cylinders) is analyzed. It is shown that the onset of turbulence is accompanied by the formation of large vortices. The results are analyzed and compared with those of similar studies.","O. M. Belotserkovskii1, V. V.

244,Regular perturbation solution of Couette flow (non-Newtonian) between two parallel porous plates: a numerical analysis with irreversibility,"The unavailability of wasted energy due to the irreversibility in the process is called the entropy generation. An irreversible process is a process in which the entropy of the system is increased. The second law of thermodynamics is used to define whether the given system is reversible or irreversible. Here, our focus is how to reduce the entropy of the system and maximize the capability of the system. There are many methods for maximizing the capacity of heat transport. The constant pressure gradient or motion of the wall can be used to increase the heat transfer rate and minimize the entropy. The objective of this study is to analyze the heat and mass transfer of an Eyring-Powell fluid in a porous channel. For this, we choose two different fluid models, namely, the plane and generalized Couette flows. The flow is generated in the channel due to a pressure gradient or with the moving of the upper lid. The present analysis shows the effects of the fluid parameters on the velocity, the temperature, the entropy generation, and the Bejan number. The nonlinear boundary value problem of the flow problem is solved with the help of the regular perturbation method. To validate the perturbation solution, a numerical solution is also obtained with the help of the built-in command NDSolve of MATHEMATICA 11.0. The velocity profile shows the shear thickening behavior via first-order Eyring-Powell parameters. It is also observed that the profile of the Bejan number has a decreasing trend against the Brinkman number. When ηi → 0 (i = 1, 2, 3), the Eyring-Powell fluid is transformed into a Newtonian fluid.","M. Nazeer1, M. I. Khan2, S. Kadry3, Yuming Chu4,5, F. Ahmad6, W. Ali7, M. Irfan2 & …M.

Up till now, one-dimensional sediment transport models have been used. The model under study makes allowance for complicated bottom relief, the porosity of the bottom sediment, the size and density of sediment particles, gravity, wave-generated shear stress, and other factors. For the corresponding initial–boundary value problem the uniqueness of a solution is proved, and an a priori estimate for the solution norm is obtained depending on integral estimates of the right-hand side, boundary conditions, and the norm of the initial condition. A conservative difference scheme with weights is constructed that approximates the continuous initial–boundary value problem. Sufficient conditions for the stability of the scheme, which impose constraints on its time step, are given.

246,Logical analysis of numerical data,"“Logical analysis of data” (LAD) is a methodology developed since the late eighties, aimed at discovering hidden structural information in data sets. LAD was originally developed for analyzing binary data by using the theory of partially defined Boolean functions. An extension of LAD for the analysis of numerical data sets is achieved through the process of “binarization” consisting in the replacement of each numerical variable by binary “indicator” variables, each showing whether the value of the original variable is above or below a certain level. Binarization was successfully applied to the analysis of a variety of real life data sets. This paper develops the theoretical foundations of the binarization process studying the combinatorial optimization problems related to the minimization of the number of binary variables. To provide an algorithmic framework for the practical solution of such problems, we construct compact linear integer programming formulations of them. We develop polynomial time algorithms for some of these minimization problems, and prove NP-hardness of others.","Endre Boros1, Peter L.

247,Numerical Simulation of the Two-Dimensional Heat Diffusion in the Cold Substrate and Performance Analysis of a Thermoelectric Air Cooler Using The Lattice Boltzmann Method,"This article presents numerical simulations of the two-dimensional temperature distribution in the cold substrate and a performance analysis of a thermoelectric cooler with the Lattice Boltzmann Method. A detailed and concise procedure for the derivation of the source term of Lattice Boltzmann method for a thermal diffusion problem is presented. Numerical simulations are performed using the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook collision operator with two velocity schemes, namely D2Q4 and D2Q9. The numerical validation is performed by comparisons with an approximate analytical solution and a finite difference method solution. Later, performance parameters of the thermoelectric cooler, based on thermal resistances, are computed from the obtained temperature distribution. The results show that the Lattice Boltzmann Method is capable of simulating the addressed thermal diffusion problem, with very small relative errors (maximum errors of 0.09%) for the temperature distribution. Excellent agreement is observed for the performance parameters, ensuring the robustness of the method. Furthermore, the procedure for the solution of the differential equation can be easily applied to solve other problems.","Matheus dos Santos Guzella

274,Expressions for the Fractional Modification in Different Monocyclic Enzyme Cascade Systems: Analysis of their Validity Tested by Numerical Integration,"This paper presents the derivation, under a minimal set of assumptions, of a general expression for the steady-state fractional modification of an interconvertible protein involved in four different schemes of monocyclic enzyme cascade systems. From this general expression we derive, as particular cases, other, simpler expressions by applying additional assumptions and which have, therefore, a smaller range of validity. Some of these particular expressions coincide with those already obtained in previous contributions on individualised analyses. We discuss the relationships between the kinetic parameters and the concentrations needed for the fulfilment of the additional assumptions. The goodness of the analysis was tested by reference to the shape in the steady-state of the simulated time progress curves obtained by numerical integration.","R. Varón1, E. Valero1, M.

The idea of the method is to reduce a boundary value problem on the real line to a boundary value problem on a finite interval by using linear approximation of the unstable and stable manifolds. Using the fact that the linearized operator of the problem is Fredholm in Banach spaces with exponential weights, the authors employed the general theory of approximation of nonlinear problems to show that the errors in the approximate solution decay exponentially with the length of the approximating interval.

The case of high-contrast conducting media is studied in detail, with the conducting nonhomogeneity embedded in a poorly conducting medium. The analysis of the integral equation, in this case, has shown that the solution deteriorates when the conducting nonhomogeneity is inside a low-conductivity layer.

The contrast effect is most pronounced for the H -polarized two-dimensional electromagnetic field in a nonhomogeneous medium. The numerical experiment has accordingly been conducted for this particular case. The solution computed by the integral equation method with elevated background conductivity is compared with the solution computed by the finite-difference method.

Inasmuch as the use of the method of characteristics becomes complicated if shock waves are present, it is easier to follow a gas-dynamics approach and employ one of the available procedures for solving one-dimensional systems of conservation equations. A recently introduced technique, due to McGuire and Morris [1, see also 12] and known as an Explicit-Implicit method, is used here for a simple boundary-value problem of wave propagation in bubbly two-phase mixtures, and is found to be simple and versatile. A comparison of this method with the well-known Lax-Wendroff (two-step) scheme demonstrates that shock fronts are simulated better, oscillations behind the shocks are smoothable by parameter adjustment, and computation time is reduced when the Explicit-Implicit method is employed.","M.

301,Numerical Equilibrium Analysis for Structured Consumer Resource Models,"In this paper, we present methods for a numerical equilibrium and stability analysis for models of a size structured population competing for an unstructured resource. We concentrate on cases where two model parameters are free, and thus existence boundaries for equilibria and stability boundaries can be defined in the (two-parameter) plane. We numerically trace these implicitly defined curves using alternatingly tangent prediction and Newton correction. Evaluation of the maps defining the curves involves integration over individual size and individual survival probability (and their derivatives) as functions of individual age. Such ingredients are often defined as solutions of ODE, i.e., in general only implicitly. In our case, the right-hand sides of these ODE feature discontinuities that are caused by an abrupt change of behavior at the size where juveniles are assumed to turn adult. So, we combine the numerical solution of these ODE with curve tracing methods. We have implemented the algorithms for “Daphnia consuming algae” models in C-code.

303, Numerical analysis of the primal problem of elastoplasticity with hardening," The finite element method is a reasonable and frequently utilised tool for the spatial discretization within one time-step in an elastoplastic evolution problem. In this paper, we analyse the finite element discretization and prove a priori and a posteriori error estimates for variational inequalities corresponding to the primal formulation of (Hencky) plasticity. The finite element method of lowest order consists in minimising a convex function on a subspace of continuous piecewise linear resp. piecewise constant trial functions. An a priori error estimate is established for the fully-discrete method which shows linear convergence as the mesh-size tends to zero, provided the exact displacement field u is smooth. Near the boundary of the plastic domain, which is unknown a priori, it is most likely that u is non-smooth. In this situation, automatic mesh-refinement strategies are believed to improve the quality of the finite element approximation. We suggest such an adaptive algorithm on the basis of a computable a posteriori error estimate. This estimate is reliable and efficient in the sense that the quotient of the error by the estimate and its inverse are bounded from above. The constants depend on the hardening involved and become larger for decreasing hardening.",Carsten Carstensen,Numerische Mathematik,1999,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002110050431,"Mathematics Subject Classification (1991):65N30, 65R20, 73C50"

The existence, uniqueness, and exponential stability of the solution of the repairable robot safety system is studied using Volterra-type integral-differential-equation theory, and the spectral distribution of the ACP operator is discussed. Moreover, the authors propose a method to investigate the steady-state indicator of the robot safety system with the safety component working, and with or without the component revolving, to make use of the correspondence of the eigenvector to the eigenvalue zero. The authors show that the robot’s operation, with or without the safety component revolving and with fractional motion, is superior to that with the safety component working. The novelty of the approach lies in its examination of a unique solution to the system and its exponential stability based on C0-semi-group theory, the co-final relative theory, and the functional analysis method.","Xing Qiao1,2 & Dan Ma",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-019-7353-7,"Numerical analysis,reliability index,robot safety system,stability"
305,An Analysis of Grid-Clustering Rules in a Boundary Layer Using the Numerical Solution of the Problem of Viscous Flow over a Plate,"AbstractThe problem of the supersonic flow of a viscous compressible gas over a flat plate at a zero angle of attack was numerically studied. The two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations were solved at various Reynolds numbers on adaptive grids with boundary-layer mesh refinement. Well-known grids constructed with the help of coordinate transformations eliminating boundary layers of various types were considered. The characteristics of numerical solutions (the value and order of the error, the value and order of the solution jump, and computation time) were analyzed in a series of numerical experiments. The advantages, shortcomings, and the applicability of each boundary layer mesh refinement rule for finding the numerical solution of this problem were discussed. The novelty of this work lies in the analysis of special adaptive grids and their use for solving problems applied in various fields of supersonic aero- and gas dynamics.","A. N. Kudryavtsev1,2, V.

Two classes of cases are investigated: a first class in which the behaviour of the predator is ‘blind’ and the second one in which the behaviour is ‘intelligent’.

Mostly, these accumulation patterns are calculated using time step methods, even though only the resulting steady state patterns of the model are of interest. We examine the steady state solutions of the hormone transport model of Smith et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103(5):1301–1306, 2006) for a one-dimensional row of plant cells. We search for the steady state solutions as a function of three of the model parameters by using numerical continuation methods and bifurcation analysis. These methods are more adequate for solving steady state problems than time step methods. We discuss a trivial solution where the concentrations of hormones are equal in all cells and examine its stability region. We identify two generic bifurcation scenarios through which the trivial solution loses its stability. The trivial solution becomes either a steady state pattern with regular spaced peaks or a pattern where the concentration is periodic in time.","Delphine Draelants1, Jan Broeckhove1, Gerrit T. S.

The largest group are variants of the h-version of the finite element method (h-FEM), where low order Ansatz functions are used. By contrast, we3 investigate a combination of high order FEM and a fictitious domain approach, the finite cell method (FCM). While the FCM has been verified and validated in previous publications, this article proposes methods on how the FCM can be made computationally efficient to the extent that it can be used for patient specific, interactive bone simulations. This approach is called computational steering and allows to change input parameters like the position of an implant, material or loads and leads to an almost instantaneous change in the output (stress lines, deformations). This direct feedback gives the user an immediate impression of the impact of his actions to an extent which, otherwise, is hard to obtain by the use of classical non interactive computations. Specifically, we investigate an application to pre-surgical planning of a total hip replacement where it is desirable to select an optimal implant for a specific patient. Herein, optimal is meant in the sense that the expected post-operative stress distribution in the bone closely resembles that before the operation.","Zhengxiong Yang1, Stefan Kollmannsberger1, Alexander Düster2, Martin Ruess1, Eduardo Grande Garcia3, Rainer Burgkart3 & …Ernst Rank",Computing and Visualization in Science,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00791-012-0175-y,"Surgical planning,Computational steering,Finite cell method,Total hip replacement"

This paper discusses two case studies involving numerical methods and analysis applied to this wide domain. The focus is on highlighting relative strengths in those intersection areas where there are many problems of interest both to numerical analysts and to researchers in the visual computing community. The first involves motion simulation and calibration of soft objects such as cloth, plants, and skin. The governing elastodynamics PDE system, discretized in space already at the variational level using co-rotated FEM, leads to a large, expensive to assemble, dynamical system in time, where the damped motion may mask highly oscillatory stiffness. Geometric integration and exponential time differencing ideas are making their way into visual computing research these days in search for more quantitative computations that are required for applications such as control and 3D printing. The other case study involves some image processing problems where there is a premium for local approaches that do not necessarily use underlying PDEs.

The main factors affecting the bubble morphology and the dynamic characteristics are summarized from numerous parameter experiments. It is shown that, in the absence of a free surface, the main factors are the relative size of the bubbles, the pressure of the liquid, and the pressure differences among the bubbles, while in the presence of a free surface, the main factor is the pressure of the liquid between the upper surface of the bubble and the free surface.","Hui Guan1, Jincheng Wang2, Zhijun Wei3 & …Chuijie Wu",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-019-2509-6,"compressible two-phase flow,interaction of bubbles,OpenFOAM"

All diffusion terms are anisotropic and heterogeneous and they are discretized by piecewise linear non-conforming triangular finite elements whereas the mobilities are discretized on dual diamond mesh. The mobilities are approximated by a non-standard way considering the inverse of the mean value of the inverse of mobilities across the interface of the dual mesh. This approximation ensures a priori estimates on the global pressure and on the water saturation. Under the assumption of non-degeneracry of mobilities, we prove the convergence of the combined scheme for the complete two-phase flow including the non-equilibrium capillary pressure.","Khaled Bouadjila1, Ali Samir Saad2, Mazen Saad3 & …Wissal Mesfar",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-022-09972-0,"Finite element,Finite volume,Two-phase flow,Dynamic capillary pressure,Anisotropic,Porous media"
338,Novel Numerical Analysis of Multi-Term Time Fractional Viscoelastic Non-Newtonian Fluid Models for Simulating Unsteady Mhd Couette Flow of a Generalized Oldroyd-B Fluid,"In this paper, we consider the application of the finite difference method for a class of novel multi-term time fractional viscoelastic non-Newtonian fluid models. An important contribution of the work is that the new model not only has a multi-term time derivative, of which the fractional order indices range from 0 to 2, but also possesses a special time fractional operator on the spatial derivative that is challenging to approximate. There appears to be no literature reported on the numerical solution of this type of equation. We derive two new different finite difference schemes to approximate the model. Then we establish the stability and convergence analysis of these schemes based on the discrete H1 norm and prove that their accuracy is of O(τ + h2) and O(τmin{3–γs,2–αq,2–β}+h2), respectively. Finally, we verify our methods using two numerical examples and apply the schemes to simulate an unsteady magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Couette flow of a generalized Oldroyd-B fluid model. Our methods are effective and can be extended to solve other non-Newtonian fluid models such as the generalized Maxwell fluid model, the generalized second grade fluid model and the generalized Burgers fluid model.","Libo Feng1, Fawang Liu1, Ian Turner1,2 & …Liancun Zheng",Fractional Calculus and Applied Analysis,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1515/fca-2018-0058,"Primary 26A33,Secondary 35Q35,65M06,65M12,76W05"

The Fourier method via the local transform is first used to investigate parametrically the stability conditions of the proposed scheme.

These conditions are further verified by the matrix method. Since two different methods are employed, one can ensure that the stability conditions are achieved consistently.

364,Numerical analysis of a stabilized scheme applied to incompressible elasticity problems with Dirichlet and with mixed boundary conditions,"We analyze a new stabilized dual-mixed method applied to incompressible linear elasticity problems, considering two kinds of data on the boundary of the domain: non homogeneous Dirichlet and mixed boundary conditions. In this approach, we circumvent the standard use of the rotation to impose weakly the symmetry of stress tensor. We prove that the new variational formulation and the corresponding Galerkin scheme are well-posed. We also provide the rate of convergence when each row of the stress is approximated by Raviart-Thomas elements and the displacement is approximated by continuous piecewise polynomials. Moreover, we derive a residual a posteriori error estimator for each situation. The corresponding analysis is quite different, depending on the type of boundary conditions. For known displacement on the whole boundary, we based our analysis on Ritz projection of the error, which requires a suitable quasi-Helmholtz decomposition of functions living in H(div;Ω). As a result, we obtain a simple a posteriori error estimator, which consists of five residual terms, and results to be reliable and locally efficient. On the other hand, when we consider mixed boundary conditions, these tools are not necessary. Then, we are able to develop an a posteriori error analysis, which provides us of an estimator consisting of three residual terms. In addition, we prove that in general this estimator is reliable, and when the traction datum is piecewise polynomial, locally efficient. In the second situation, we propose a numerical procedure to compute the numerical approximation, at a reasonable cost. Finally, we include several numerical experiments that illustrate the performance of the corresponding adaptive algorithm for each problem, and support its use in practice.","Tomás P.

369,An Alternative Formalism for the Single-Heated Channel Numerical Analysis,Abstract—Development of quick and versatile simulation packages to investigate time dependent heat transfer phenomena in nuclear reactors or steam generators is an ongoing research interest. The work presented herein is an alternative attempt to address this issue employing a single heated channel framework. A homogenous equivalent mixture is assumed for the two phase flow inside the channel. The sectionalized compressible formalism is further refined and the resultant PDEs are cast into a nodalized layout employing the method of lines as a reduction scheme. Simulation results are presented for the transient heat transfer inside a coolant channel of a nuclear reactor core wherein the incumbent heat flux is affected through an inherent thermo-neutronic feedback mechanism. The overall model reduction strategy likewise provides a suitable platform for the purpose of stability analysis or control synthesis practices.,M.

This model avoids the infinite speed paradox, inherent to the standard parabolic model and introduces a new parameter τ called relaxation time. This parameter plays the role of an “inertia” for the movement of the pollutant.The analysis presented herein is twofold: first, we perform an accurate study of the 1D steady-state equations and its numerical solution. We compare the solution of the hyperbolic model with that of the parabolic model and we analyze the influence of the relaxation time on the solution. On the other hand, we explore the possibilities of the proposed model for real-world applications. With this aim we solve an example concerning the evolution of a pollutant being spilled in the harbor of A Coruña (northwest of Spain, EU).","H. Gómez1,2, I. Colominas2, F. Navarrina2 & …M.

The complex variable method and the conformal mapping technique are used. The continuity conditions for the traction and displacement along the interface in the physical plane are reduced to the similar conditions along the unit circle of the mapping plane.

More precisely, the space approximation of the fluid problem is realized by standard mixed finite elements, the shell is approximated by DKT finite elements, and time derivatives are approximated either by midpoint rules or by backward difference formula.Using fundamental energy estimates on the continuous problem written in a proper functional space, on its discrete equivalent, and on an associated error evolution equation, we can prove that the proposed variational problem is well posed, and that its approximation in space and time converges with optimal order to the continuous solution.",Patrick Le Tallec1 & Saloua Mani,Numerische Mathematik,2000,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002110000183,Mathematics Subject Classification (1991): 65N30

First, we describe numerical methods for continuation and bifurcation analysis of steady state solutions and periodic solutions of systems of delay differential equations with an arbitrary number of fixed, discrete delays. Second, we demonstrate how these methods can be used to obtain insight into complex biological regulatory systems in which interactions occur with time delays: for this, we consider a system of two equations for the plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in a diabetic patient subject to a system of external assistance. The model has two delays: the technological delay of the external system, and the physiological delay of the patient's liver. We compute stability of the steady state solution as a function of two parameters, compare with analytical results and compute several branches of periodic solutions and their stability. These numerical results allow to infer two categories of diabetic patients for which the external system has different efficiency.","K. Engelborghs1, V. Lemaire2, J. Bélair3 & …D.

Compared with many classical finite element fluid solvers, this numerical method avoids a Stokes solver, and only two Poisson-like equations need to be solved at each time step/stage. In addition, its combination with the fully explicit fourth order Runge–Kutta (RK4) time discretization enables us to compute high Reynolds number flow in a very efficient way. As an application of this robust numerical solver, the dynamical mechanism of the boundary layer separation for a triangular cavity flow with Reynolds numbers \(Re=10^4\) and \(Re=10^5\), including the precise values of bifurcation location and critical time, are reported in this paper. In addition, we provide a super-convergence analysis for the simple finite element numerical scheme, using linear elements over a uniform triangulation with right triangles.","Yunhua Xue1, Cheng Wang2 & Jian-Guo Liu",Journal of Scientific Computing,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-015-0005-8,"Incompressible flows,Boundary layer separation ,Structural bifurcation,Simple finite element method ,Super-convergence analysis"
377,Analytical-Numerical Method for Solving an Orr–Sommerfeld-Type Problem for Analysis of Instability of Ocean Currents,"AbstractStable and unstable disturbances of ocean currents are studied by analyzing a spectral problem based on the evolution potential vorticity equation in the quasi-geostrophic approximation. The problem is reduced to a fourth-order nonself-adjoint differential equation with a small parameter multiplying the highest derivative and with several dimensionless physical parameters. A feature of the problem is that the spectral parameter is involved in both the equation and boundary conditions for the third derivative. The problem is considered in two versions, namely, with a boundary condition setting the function or its second derivative to zero. An efficient analytical-numerical method is constructed for solving the problem. According to this method, even and odd functions are computed using power series expansions of the solution at boundary and middle points of the layer. An equation for the desired spectrum of the problem is derived by matching the expansions at an interior point. The asymptotic expansions of solutions and eigenvalues for small values of the wave number \(k\) are studied. It is found that the problem for even and odd solutions with the boundary condition for the second derivative has a single finite eigenvalue and a countable set of indefinitely increasing eigenvalues as \(k \to 0\). The problem with the boundary condition for the function has only a countable set of indefinitely increasing eigenvalues as \(k \to 0\). The eigenvalues are computed for various parameters of the problem. The numerical results show that a current can be unstable in a wide range of \(k\).",S. L. Skorokhodov1 & N. P.

379,Asymptotic Analysis and Numerical Methods for Oscillatory Infinite Generalized Bessel Transforms with an Irregular Oscillator,"In this work, we perform a complete asymptotic analysis and the construction of affordable quadrature rules for a class of oscillatory infinite Bessel transform with a general oscillator. Especially in the presence of critical points, e.g., endpoints, zeros and stationary points, we first derive a series of useful asymptotic expansions in inverse powers of the frequency parameter \(\omega \). The resulting asymptotic expansions clarify the large \(\omega \) behavior of the transform and provide powerful tools for designing quadrature rules and conducting error analysis. As a consequence, efficient and affordable new modified Filon-type methods for computing the transform numerically are proposed. Particularly, we carry out the rigorous error analysis and obtain asymptotic error estimates in inverse powers of \(\omega \). Numerical examples can confirm our analysis. The accuracy can be improved greatly by either adding more derivatives interpolation at endpoints or adding more interior nodes. Moreover, only using a small number of nodes and multiplicities, we can obtain the required accuracy level. For fixed number of nodes and multiplicities, the higher accuracy can be achieved with the larger values of \(\omega \).","Hongchao Kang

This model describes the chemotactic attraction experienced by the tumor cells and induced by a so-called active extracellular matrix, which is a chemical signal produced by a biological reaction between the extracellular matrix and a matrix-degrading enzyme. In order to construct the numerical approximations and to control the chemo-attraction term in the tumor cells equation, we introduce an equivalent model with a new variable given by the gradient of the active extracellular matrix and use an inductive strategy. Then, we consider a first-order and non-linear time-discrete scheme which is mass-conservative and possesses the property of positivity for all the biological variables. After, we study the corresponding fully discrete finite element with “mass-lumping” approximation proving well-posedness, mass-conservation and the non-negativity of the extracellular matrix, the degrading enzyme, and the active extracellular matrix. In addition, we obtain uniform strong estimates required in the convergence analysis, and we prove optimal error estimates and convergence towards regular solutions. Finally, we provide some numerical results in agreement with our theoretical analysis with respect to the positivity and the error estimates.","Jhean E. Pérez-López1, Diego A. Rueda-Gómez

This relates to the more usual approximation by a rational function in that it could imply how many decimal places are needed when applying a particularly good rational function approximation having non-integrad coefficients.It is shown how to obtain “good” approximations of this type and it is also shown how under certain circumstances “very good” bounds are not possible. As in diophantine approximation this means that many merely “good” approximations do exist, which may be the preferable case. The existence or nonexistence of “very good” approximations is closely related to the diophantine approximation of the first nonzero power series coefficient of at z=0.

388,Stability analysis of a state-dependent delay differential equation for cell maturation: analytical and numerical methods,"We consider a mathematical model describing the maturation process of stem cells up to fully mature cells. The model is formulated as a differential equation with state-dependent delay, where maturity is described as a continuous variable. The maturation rate of cells may be regulated by the amount of mature cells and, moreover, it may depend on cell maturity: we investigate how the stability of equilibria is affected by the choice of the maturation rate. We show that the principle of linearised stability holds for this model, and develop some analytical methods for the investigation of characteristic equations for fixed delays. For a general maturation rate we resort to numerical methods and we extend the pseudospectral discretisation technique to approximate the state-dependent delay equation with a system of ordinary differential equations. This is the first application of the technique to nonlinear state-dependent delay equations, and currently the only method available for studying the stability of equilibria by means of established software packages for bifurcation analysis. The numerical method is validated on some cases when the maturation rate is independent of maturity and the model can be reformulated as a fixed-delay equation via a suitable time transformation. We exploit the analytical and numerical methods to investigate the stability boundary in parameter planes. Our study shows some drastic qualitative changes in the stability boundary under assumptions on the model parameters, which may have important biological implications.","Philipp Getto1, Mats Gyllenberg2, Yukihiko Nakata3 & …Francesca Scarabel

The first equation of an elliptic type is defined with respect to the electric potential, the successive two equations of convection dominated diffusion type are given to define the electron concentration and the hole concentration, and the fourth equation of heat conductor is for the temperature. The electric potential appears in the equations of electron concentration, hole concentration and the temperature in the formation of the intensity. A mass conservative numerical approximation of the electric potential is presented by using the mixed finite volume element, and the accuracy of computation of the electric intensity is improved one order. The method of characteristic fractional step difference is applied to discretize the other three equations, where the hyperbolic terms are approximated by a difference quotient in the characteristics and the diffusion terms are discretized by the method of fractional step difference.

By constructing the multi-order fractional differential equation of the error function, the approximate error function is obtained so that the numerical solution is corrected. Then, we analyze the convergence of the shifted Chebyshev polynomials approximation function. Numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the applicability of the method and the validity of error correction.","Wei Han1, Yi-Ming Chen1,2,3, Da-Yan Liu4, Xiao-Lin Li1 & …Driss Boutat",Advances in Difference Equations,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13662-018-1702-z,"Shifted Chebyshev polynomials,Multi-order fractional differential equation,Error correction,Convergence analysis,Numerical solution"

A twodimensional controlled plant with simple motion and control region in the form of a smooth planar convex compactum with interior point O should describe, in a given time, a closed curve enclosing a plane region of maxi-mum area. The initial and the final points of the trajectory coincide. The direction of the velocity vector at the initial time is given. The problem is solved by the Pontryagin maximum principle. A procedure to construct a programmed optimal control is described. An optimal control law is described in synthesis form (feedback form). The theoretical analysis relies on the apparatus of support and distance functions.

Assuming that the designed device consists of a finite number of spherical layers, each filled with a homogeneous isotropic medium, an optimization-based numerical algorithm is proposed for solving the problems. As a result, the considered inverse problems are reduced to finite-dimensional optimization ones in which the role of controls is played by the magnetic permeabilities of each elementary layer. The desired controls are found by applying particle swarm optimization. By analyzing numerical results, it is shown that the obtained optimal solutions correspond to cloaking devices having the highest efficiency in the considered class of devices and provide the simplicity of technical implementation.","G.

Compared to other existing methods, our method has higher accuracy and simpler implementation. Our numerical method has an accuracy of \({\mathcal {O}}(h^\varepsilon )\), for \(u \in C^{0, \,\alpha + \varepsilon } (\bar{\Omega })\) if \(\alpha < 1\) (or \(u \in C^{1, \,\alpha - 1 + \varepsilon } (\bar{\Omega })\) if \(\alpha \ge 1\)) with \(\varepsilon > 0\), suggesting the minimum consistency conditions. The accuracy can be improved to \({\mathcal {O}}(h^2)\), for \(u \in C^{2, \,\alpha + \varepsilon } (\bar{\Omega })\) if \(\alpha < 1\) (or \(u \in C^{3, \,\alpha - 1 + \varepsilon } (\bar{\Omega })\) if \(\alpha \ge 1\)). Numerical experiments confirm our analytical results and provide insights in solving the tempered fractional Poisson problem. It suggests that to achieve the second order of accuracy, our method only requires the solution \(u \in C^{1,1}(\bar{\Omega })\) for any \(\alpha \in (0, 2)\). Moreover, if the solution of tempered fractional Poisson problems satisfies \(u \in C^{p, s}(\bar{\Omega })\) for \(p = 0, 1\) and \(s\in (0, 1]\), our method has the accuracy of \({\mathcal {O}}(h^{p+s})\). Since our method yields a (multilevel) Toeplitz stiffness matrix, one can design fast algorithms via the fast Fourier transform for efficient simulations.

The model comprises a system of coupled partial integro-differential equations for the phenotypic distribution of tumour cells, the concentration of oxygen and the concentration of a chemotherapeutic agent. In order to disentangle the impact of different evolutionary parameters on the emergence of intra-tumour phenotypic heterogeneity and the development of resistance to chemotherapy, we construct explicit solutions to the equation for the phenotypic distribution of tumour cells and provide a detailed quantitative characterisation of the long-time asymptotic behaviour of such solutions. Analytical results are integrated with numerical simulations of a calibrated version of the model based on biologically consistent parameter values. The results obtained provide a theoretical explanation for the observation that the phenotypic properties of tumour cells in vascularised tumours vary with the distance from the blood vessels. Moreover, we demonstrate that lower oxygen levels may correlate with higher levels of phenotypic variability, which suggests that the presence of hypoxic regions supports intra-tumour phenotypic heterogeneity. Finally, the results of our analysis put on a rigorous mathematical basis the idea, previously suggested by formal asymptotic results and numerical simulations, that hypoxia favours the selection for chemoresistant phenotypic variants prior to treatment. Consequently, this facilitates the development of resistance following chemotherapy.","Chiara Villa1, Mark A. J. Chaplain

427,Numerical analysis of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with white noise dispersion ,"This article is devoted to the numerical study of a nonlinear Schrödinger equation in which the coefficient in front of the group velocity dispersion is multiplied by a real valued Gaussian white noise. We first perform the numerical analysis of a semi-discrete Crank–Nicolson scheme in the case when the continuous equation possesses a unique global solution. We prove that the strong order of convergence in probability is equal to one in this case. In a second step, we numerically investigate, in space dimension one, the behavior of the solutions of the equation for different power nonlinearities, corresponding to subcritical, critical or supercritical nonlinearities in the deterministic case. Numerical evidence of a change in the critical power due to the presence of the noise is pointed out.","Radoin Belaouar1, Anne de Bouard1 & Arnaud Debussche",Stochastic Partial Differential Equations: Analysis and Computations,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40072-015-0044-z,"Stochastic partial differential equations,Numerical analysis,White noise dispersion"
428,Error Analysis and Numerical Simulations of Strang Splitting Method for Space Fractional Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation,"In this paper, we study a fast explicit operator splitting method for space fractional nonlinear Schrödinger equation in one (1D), two (2D) and three dimensions (3D) with periodic boundary conditions. The equation is split into linear and nonlinear parts: the linear part is solved by the Fourier spectral method, which is based on the exact solution and thus has no stability restriction on the time-step size; the nonlinear subequation is then solved analytically due to the availability of a closed-form solution. The rigorous analysis of the discrete mass conservation principle and the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm are proved. The theoretical results show the proposed method is \(L^2\) unconditionally stable, second order accurate in time, whereas the spatial accuracy depends on the regularity of the solution. Numerical experiments for 1D, 2D and 3D cases demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.","Shuying Zhai1, Dongling Wang2, Zhifeng Weng1 & …Xuan Zhao",Journal of Scientific Computing,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-019-01050-w,"Fractional nonlinear Schrödinger equation,Operator splitting method,Spectral method,Mass conservation,Error estimate"
429,Numerical and Physical Instabilities in Massively Parallel LES of Reacting Flows,"LES of reacting flows is rapidly becoming mature and providing levels of precision which can not be reached with any RANS (Reynolds Averaged) technique. In addition to the multiple subgrid scale models required for such LES and to the questions raised by the required numerical accuracy of LES solvers, various issues related to the reliability, mesh independence and repetitivity of LES must still be addressed, especially when LES is used on massively parallel machines. This talk discusses some of these issues: (1) the existence of non physical waves (known as ‘wiggles’ by most LES practitioners) in LES, (2) the effects of mesh size on LES of reacting flows, (3) the growth of rounding errors in LES on massively parallel machines and more generally (4) the ability to qualify a LES code as ‘bug free’ and ‘accurate’. Examples range from academic cases (minimum non-reacting turbulent channel) to applied configurations (a sector of an helicopter combustion chamber).","T. Poinsot1, M. Garcia2, J. M. Senoner2, L.

The midpoint  quadrature rule is used to approximate the distributed-order equation by a multi-term fractional form. Next the transformed multi-term fractional equation is solved by discretizing in space by the fractional backward differential formulas method for \(0<\alpha <1\) and the shifted Grünwald difference operators for \(1< \beta < 2\) to approximate the Riesz space fractional derivative and in time by using the Crank-Nicolson scheme.

We show that the software pde2path can be exploited to treat cross-diffusion systems, reproducing the already computed bifurcation diagrams on 1D domains. We show the convergence of the bifurcation structure obtained selecting the growth rate as bifurcation parameter. Then, we compute the bifurcation diagram on a 2D rectangular domain providing the shape of the solutions along the branches and linking the results with the linearized analysis. In 1D and 2D, we pay particular attention to the fast-reaction limit by always computing sequences of bifurcation diagrams as the time-scale separation parameter tends to zero. We show that the bifurcation diagram undergoes major deformations once the fast-reaction systems limits onto the cross-diffusion singular limit. Furthermore, we find evidence for time-periodic solutions by detecting Hopf bifurcations, we characterize several regions of multi-stability, and improve our understanding of the shape of patterns in 2D for the SKT model.","Christian Kuehn

441,"A Uniquely Solvable, Energy Stable Numerical Scheme for the Functionalized Cahn–Hilliard Equation and Its Convergence Analysis","We present and analyze a uniquely solvable and unconditionally energy stable numerical scheme for the Functionalized Cahn–Hilliard equation, including an analysis of convergence. One key difficulty associated with the energy stability is based on the fact that one nonlinear energy functional term in the expansion is neither convex nor concave. To overcome this subtle difficulty, we add two auxiliary terms to make the combined term convex, which in turns yields a convex–concave decomposition of the physical energy. As a result, both the unconditional unique solvability and the unconditional energy stability of the proposed numerical scheme are assured. In addition, a global in time \(H_{\mathrm{per}}^2\) stability of the numerical scheme is established at a theoretical level, which in turn ensures the full order convergence analysis of the scheme, which is the first such result in this field. To deal with an implicit 4-Laplacian term at each time step, we apply an efficient preconditioned steepest descent algorithm to solve the corresponding nonlinear systems in the finite difference set-up. A few numerical results are presented, which confirm the stability and accuracy of the proposed numerical scheme.","Wenqiang Feng1, Zhen Guan2, John Lowengrub2, Cheng Wang

The main theoretical result of the paper is the convergence of the penalty based numerical solutions to the solution of the constrained inequality problem as the mesh-size and the penalty parameter approach zero independently.

We use it to establish a novel convergence result in \(L^\infty (0,T; L^2(\Omega ))\) of the approximate concentration using minimal regularity assumptions on the solution to the continuous problem. The convection term in the concentration equation is discretised using a centred scheme. We present a variety of numerical tests from the literature, as well as a novel analytical test case. The performance of two schemes is compared on these tests; both are poor in the case of variable viscosity, small diffusion and medium to small time steps. We show that upstreaming is not a good option to recover stable and accurate solutions, and we propose a correction to recover stable and accurate schemes for all time steps and all ranges of diffusion.","Jérôme Droniou1, Robert Eymard2, Alain Prignet2 & …Kyle S.

For our illustrations, we considered two benchmark problems, namely (a) the one-dimensional viscous Burgers with both homogeneous (Dirichlet) and non-homogeneous boundary conditions, and, (b) the one- and two-dimensional Liouville–Bratu–Gelfand PDEs with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. For the one-dimensional Burgers and Bratu PDEs, exact analytical solutions are available and used for comparison purposes against the numerical derived solutions. Furthermore, the numerical efficiency (in terms of numerical accuracy, size of the grid and execution times) of the proposed numerical machine-learning method is compared against central finite differences (FD) and Galerkin weighted-residuals finite-element (FEM) methods. We show that the proposed numerical machine learning method outperforms in terms of numerical accuracy both FD and FEM methods for medium to large sized grids, while provides equivalent results with the FEM for low to medium sized grids; both methods (ELM and FEM) outperform the FD scheme. Furthermore, the computational times required with the proposed machine learning scheme were comparable and in particular slightly smaller than the ones required with FEM.","Gianluca Fabiani1, Francesco Calabrò2, Lucia Russo3 & …Constantinos Siettos

Using a similarity transformation, the governing time-dependent boundary layer equations for the momentum, heat and mass transfer were reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations. This set of ordinary equations were then solved using the spectral local linearization method together with the successive relaxation method. The study made among others the observation that the local Sherwood number increases with increasing values of the unsteadiness parameter and the Schmidt number. The fluid temperature was found to be significantly reduced by increasing values of the Prandtl number and the thermal radiation parameter. The velocity profiles were found to be reduced by increasing values of the chemical reaction and the Schmidt number as well as by the magnetic parameter.",Stanford Shateyi1 & Gerald Tendayi Marewo,Boundary Value Problems,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13661-014-0218-z,"Nusselt Number,Stagnation Point,Heat Transfer,Schmidt Number,Homotopy Analysis Method"

459,Numerical Analysis of Fluid Flow Behaviour in Four-Sided Square Lid-Driven Cavity Using the Finite Volume Technique,"In the present study, numerical simulations of two-dimensional steady-state incompressible Newtonian fluid flow in one-sided and four-sided lid-driven square cavities are reported. For the one-sided lid-driven cavity, the upper wall is moved to the right with up to 5000 Reynolds numbers under a grid size of up to \( 501\times 501\). This lends support to previous findings in the literature. Two cases are used in this article for the four-sided lid-driven square cavity specifically. In case-I, the top and lower walls are moved to the right, while the left and right walls are moved upward and downward, respectively. In case II, the top wall is moved to the left, the lower wall to the right, the left wall is moved upward, and the right wall is moved downward, with all three walls moving at the same speed one and the bottom wall moving at two. Conventional numerical solutions show that the unique solutions exist for all Reynolds numbers for both the geometries. All possible flow solutions are studied in the present article, as velocity profiles and streamline contours for the same Reynolds number using a finite volume SIMPLE technique. The work done in this paper includes flow properties such as the location of primary and secondary vortices, velocity components, and numerical values for benchmarking purposes, and it is in excellent agreement with previous findings in the literature.

It turns out that the spectral convergence rate can only occur for KGE models with entire potentials.

466,Interval propagation and search on directed acyclic graphs for numerical constraint solving,"The fundamentals of interval analysis on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for global optimization and constraint propagation have recently been proposed in Schichl and Neumaier (J. Global Optim. 33, 541–562, 2005). For representing numerical problems, the authors use DAGs whose nodes are subexpressions and whose directed edges are computational flows. Compared to tree-based representations [Benhamou et al. Proceedings of the International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP’99), pp. 230–244. Las Cruces, USA (1999)], DAGs offer the essential advantage of more accurately handling the influence of subexpressions shared by several constraints on the overall system during propagation. In this paper we show how interval constraint propagation and search on DAGs can be made practical and efficient by: (1) flexibly choosing the nodes on which propagations must be performed, and (2) working with partial subgraphs of the initial DAG rather than with the entire graph. We propose a new interval constraint propagation technique which exploits the influence of subexpressions on all the constraints together rather than on individual constraints. We then show how the new propagation technique can be integrated into branch-and-prune search to solve numerical constraint satisfaction problems. This algorithm is able to outperform its obvious contenders, as shown by the experiments.","Xuan-Ha Vu1, Hermann Schichl2 & Djamila Sam-Haroud",Journal of Global Optimization,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-008-9386-7,"Interval constraint propagation,Directed acyclic graphs,Branch and prune"

469,Numerical Bifurcation Analysis of Physiologically Structured Population Models via Pseudospectral Approximation,"Physiologically structured population models are typically formulated as a partial differential equation of transport type for the density, with a boundary condition describing the birth of new individuals. Here we develop numerical bifurcation methods by combining pseudospectral approximate reduction to a finite dimensional system with the use of established tools for ODE. A key preparatory step is to view the density as the derivative of the cumulative distribution. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we consider two classes of models: a size-structured model for waterfleas (Daphnia) and a maturity-structured model for cell proliferation. Using the package MatCont, we compute numerical bifurcation diagrams, like steady-state stability regions in a two-parameter plane and parametrized branches of equilibria and periodic solutions. Our rather positive conclusion is that a rather low dimension may yield a rather accurate diagram! In addition we show numerically that, for the two models considered here, equilibria of the approximating system converge to the true equilibrium as the dimension of the approximating system increases; this last result is also proved theoretically under some regularity conditions on the model ingredients.","Francesca Scarabel

This can be achieved by applying formal methods, such as machine-checked proofs. But these tools handle mathematical theorems while we are interested in C code, in which numerical computations are performed using floating-point arithmetic, whereas proof tools typically handle exact real arithmetic. To achieve this high level of confidence on C programs, we use a chain of tools: Frama-C, its Jessie plugin, Why and provers among Coq, Gappa, Alt-Ergo, CVC3 and Z3. This approach requires the C program to be annotated: each function must be precisely specified, and we prove the correctness of the program by proving both that it meets its specifications and that no runtime error may occur. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate, on various examples, the features of this approach.","Sylvie Boldo1,2 & Claude Marché1,",Mathematics in Computer Science,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11786-011-0099-9,"Floating-point arithmetic,C program,Formal specification,Automated reasoning"
471,"Seven pivotal theorems of Fourier analysis, signal analysis, numerical analysis and number theory: their interconnections","The present paper deals mainly with seven fundamental theorems of mathematical analysis, numerical analysis, and number theory, namely the generalized Parseval decomposition formula (GPDF), introduced 15 years ago, the well-known approximate sampling theorem (ASF), the new approximate reproducing kernel theorem, the basic Poisson summation formula, already known to Gauß, a newer version of the GPDF having a structure similar to that of the Poisson summation formula, namely, the Parseval decomposition–Poisson summation formula, the functional equation of Riemann’s zeta function, as well as the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula. It will in fact be shown that these seven theorems are all equivalent to one another, in the sense that each is a corollary of the others. Since these theorems can all be deduced from each other, one of them has to be proven independently in order to verify all. It is convenient to choose the ASF, introduced in 1963. The epilogue treats possible extensions to the more general contexts of reproducing kernel theory and of abstract harmonic analysis, using locally compact abelian groups. This paper is expository in the sense that it treats a number of mathematical theorems, their interconnections, their equivalence to one another. On the other hand, the proofs of the many intricate interconnections among these theorems are new in their essential steps and conclusions.","P. L. Butzer1, M. M. Dodson2, P. J. S. G. Ferreira3, J.

472,A model and a numerical scheme for the description of distribution and abundance of individuals,"We introduce a model in the context of ecology that can be used to describe the distribution and abundance of individuals when data from field work is extremely limited (for example, in the case of endangered species). Our procedure is based on an intuitive understanding of the physical properties of phenomena. The idea is that individuals have the tendency to be attracted (or repulsed) to certain properties of the environment. At the same time, they are spread in such a way that if there is no reason for them to be in some specific locations, then they are uniformly distributed throughout the region. Our model draws from quantum mechanics, by using quantum Hamiltonians in the context of classical statistical mechanics. The equilibrium between the spreading and the attractive (or repulsive) forces determines the behavior of the species that we model, and this is expressed in terms of a global control problem of an energy operator which is the sum of a kinetic term (spreading) and a potential (attraction or repulsion). We focus on the full probability measure and a global control of the model (instead of looking at conditional measures that generate a global measure). Furthermore, we propose a numerical solution to this global control problem that overcomes the well-known major difficulty of Gibbs sampling (annealing) which is the fact that a global control is hardly reachable when the number of variables is large (the algorithms get stuck in non-optimal states).","Miguel Ballesteros

473,On the Convergence and Well-Balanced Property of Path-Conservative Numerical Schemes for Systems of Balance Laws,"This paper deals with the numerical approximation of one-dimensional hyperbolic systems of balance laws. We consider these systems as a particular case of hyperbolic systems in nonconservative form, for which we use the theory introduced by Dal Maso, LeFloch and Murat (J. Math. Pures Appl. 74:483, 1995) in order to define the concept of weak solutions. This theory is based on the prescription of a family of paths in the phases space. We also consider path-conservative schemes, that were introduced in Parés (SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 44:300, 2006). The first goal is to prove a Lax-Wendroff type convergence theorem. In Castro et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 227:8107, 2008) it was shown that, for general nonconservative systems a rather strong convergence assumption is needed to prove such a result. Here, we prove that the same hypotheses used in the classical Lax-Wendroff theorem are enough to ensure the convergence in the particular case of systems of balance laws, as the numerical results shown in Castro et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 227:8107, 2008) seemed to suggest.

It is desired to construct algorithms whose iterates also evolve on the same manifold. These algorithms can therefore be viewed as integrating ordinary differential equations on manifolds. The basic method “decouples” the computation of flows on the submanifold from the numerical integration process. It is shown that two classes of single-step and multistep algorithms can be posed and analyzed theoretically, using the concept of “freezing” the coefficients of differential operators obtained from the defining vector field.

478,Numerical algorithms for water waves with background flow over obstacles and topography,"We present two accurate and efficient algorithms for solving the incompressible, irrotational Euler equations with a free surface in two dimensions with background flow over a periodic, multiply connected fluid domain that includes stationary obstacles and variable bottom topography. One approach is formulated in terms of the surface velocity potential while the other evolves the vortex sheet strength. Both methods employ layer potentials in the form of periodized Cauchy integrals to compute the normal velocity of the free surface, are compatible with arbitrary parameterizations of the free surface and boundaries, and allow for circulation around each obstacle, which leads to multiple-valued velocity potentials but single-valued stream functions. We prove that the resulting second-kind Fredholm integral equations are invertible, possibly after a physically motivated finite-rank correction. In an angle-arclength setting, we show how to avoid curve reconstruction errors that are incompatible with spatial periodicity. We use the proposed methods to study gravity-capillary waves generated by flow around several elliptical obstacles above a flat or variable bottom boundary. In each case, the free surface eventually self-intersects in a splash singularity or collides with a boundary. We also show how to evaluate the velocity and pressure with spectral accuracy throughout the fluid, including near the free surface and solid boundaries. To assess the accuracy of the time evolution, we monitor energy conservation and the decay of Fourier modes and compare the numerical results of the two methods to each other. We implement several solvers for the discretized linear systems and compare their performance.

479,An attractive numerical algorithm for solving nonlinear Caputo–Fabrizio fractional Abel differential equation in a Hilbert space,"Our aim in this paper is presenting an attractive numerical approach giving an accurate solution to the nonlinear fractional Abel differential equation based on a reproducing kernel algorithm with model endowed with a Caputo–Fabrizio fractional derivative. By means of such an approach, we utilize the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization process to create an orthonormal set of bases that leads to an appropriate solution in the Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}^{2}[a,b]\). We investigate and discuss stability and convergence of the proposed method. The n-term series solution converges uniformly to the analytic solution. We present several numerical examples of potential interests to illustrate the reliability, efficacy, and performance of the method under the influence of the Caputo–Fabrizio derivative. The gained results have shown superiority of the reproducing kernel algorithm and its infinite accuracy with a least time and efforts in solving the fractional Abel-type model. Therefore, in this direction, the proposed algorithm is an alternative and systematic tool for analyzing the behavior of many nonlinear temporal fractional differential equations emerging in the fields of engineering, physics, and sciences.","Mohammed Al-Smadi1,2, Nadir Djeddi3, Shaher Momani2,3, Shrideh Al-Omari

480,Numerical computation of stability and detection of Hopf bifurcations of steady state solutions of delay differential equations,"The characteristic equation of a system of delay differential equations (DDEs) is a nonlinear equation with infinitely many zeros. The stability of a steady state solution of such a DDE system is determined by the number of zeros of this equation with positive real part. We present a numerical algorithm to compute the rightmost, i.e., stability determining, zeros of the characteristic equation. The algorithm is based on the application of subspace iteration on the time integration operator of the system or its variational equations. The computed zeros provide insight into the system’s behaviour, can be used for robust bifurcation detection and for efficient indirect calculation of bifurcation points.",Koen Engelborghs1 & Dirk Roose,Advances in Computational Mathematics,1999,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1018986817622,"delay differential equations,steady state solutions,stability,34K20,65J10"
481,Free boundary problem for cell protrusion formations: theoretical and numerical aspects,"In this paper, a free boundary problem for cell protrusion formation is studied theoretically and numerically. The cell membrane is precisely described thanks to a level set function, whose motion is due to specific signalling pathways. The aim is to model the chemical interactions between the cell and its environment, in the process of invadopodia or pseudopodia formation. The model consists of Laplace equation with Dirichlet condition inside the cell coupled to Laplace equation with Neumann condition in the outer domain. The actin polymerization is accounted for as the gradient of the inner signal, which drives the motion of the interface. We prove the well-posedness of our free boundary problem under a sign condition on the datum. This criterion ensures the consistency of the model, and provides conditions to focus on for any enrichment of the model. We then propose a new first order Cartesian finite-difference method to solve the problem. We eventually exhibit the main biological features that can be accounted for by the model: the formation of thin and elongated protrusions as for invadopodia, or larger protrusion as for pseudopodia, depending on the source term in the equation. The model provides the theoretical and numerical grounds for single cell migration modeling, whose formulation is valid in 2D and 3D. In particular, specific chemical reactions that occurred at the cell membrane could be precisely described in forthcoming works.","Olivier Gallinato1, Masahito Ohta2, Clair Poignard1 & …Takashi Suzuki",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-016-1080-7,"Mathematical biology,Cell protrusion formation,Free boundary problem,Finite differences on cartesian grids"

483,A continuation method for spatially discretized models with nonlocal interactions conserving size and shape of cells and lattices,"In this paper, we introduce a continuation method for the spatially discretized models, while conserving the size and shape of the cells and lattices. This proposed method is realized using the shift operators and nonlocal operators of convolution types. Through this method and using the shift operator, the nonlinear spatially discretized model on the uniform and nonuniform lattices can be systematically converted into a spatially continuous model; this renders both models point-wisely equivalent. Moreover, by the convolution with suitable kernels, we mollify the shift operator and approximate the spatially discretized models using the nonlocal evolution equations, rendering suitable for the application in both experimental and mathematical analyses. We also demonstrate that this approximation is supported by the singular limit analysis, and that the information of the lattice and cells is expressed in the shift and nonlocal operators. The continuous models designed using our method can successfully replicate the patterns corresponding to those of the original spatially discretized models obtained from the numerical simulations. Furthermore, from the observations of the isotropy of the Delta–Notch signaling system in a developing real fly brain, we propose a radially symmetric kernel for averaging the cell shape using our continuation method. We also apply our method for cell division and proliferation to spatially discretized models of the differentiation wave and describe the discrete models on the sphere surface. Finally, we demonstrate an application of our method in the linear stability analysis of the planar cell polarity model.

484,Experimental and numerical analyses of sloshing flows,"Recently the demand for sloshing analyses is rising because of the construction of large LNG carriers and LNG platforms. This study considers the experimental and numerical observations of strongly nonlinear sloshing flows in ship cargo and their coupling effects with ship motion. Violent sloshing flows in experiments are observed, and two different numerical methods, the finite-difference method and smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) method, are applied for the simulation of violent sloshing flows. Several physical issues are introduced in the analysis of sloshing flows, and the corresponding numerical models are described. This study demonstrates that physics-based numerical schemes are essential in the prediction of violent sloshing flows and sloshing-induced impact pressure. To study the sloshing effects on ship-motion, a ship-motion program based on an impulsive response function (IRF) is coupled with the developed numerical models for sloshing analysis. The results show that the nonlinearity of sloshing-induced forces and moments plays a critical role in the coupling effects.",Yonghwan Kim,Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-006-9124-4,"Coupled analysis,Impulse response function,Ship motion,Sloshing,Smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) method"

Similar models arise in option pricing, to generalize the Black–Scholes equation, when the processes which generate the underlying stock returns may contain both a continuous part and jumps. Due to the non-local nature of the integral term, unconditionally stable implicit difference schemes are not practically feasible. Here we propose using implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta methods for the time integration to solve the integral term explicitly, giving higher-order accuracy schemes under weak stability time-step restrictions. Numerical tests are presented to show the computational efficiency of the approximation.

487,Unsaturated Algorithms for the Numerical Solution of Elliptic Boundary Value Problems in Smooth Axisymmetric Domains,"Abstract A fundamentally new, unsaturated, method is
constructed for the numerical solution of the Laplace equation in a smooth axisymmetric domain
of rather general shape. An essential feature of this method is lack of the leading error term
\(O(m^{-r}) \), where \(r \) is a fixed integer with \(r>2 \). As a result, the method automatically adjusts to
the excess (extraordinary) smoothness of solutions of problems. The method provides us with a
new computational tool whose discretization inherits both differential and spectral characteristics
of the operator of the elliptic problem under consideration. This allows us to take efficiently into
account the fact that the domain is axisymmetric which is a stumbling block for numerical
methods with the leading error term. Our result is of a fundamental interest because, for
\(C^{\,\infty } \)-smooth solutions, computer constructs a numerical
solution (up to a slowly growing multiplier) with an absolutely sharp exponential error estimate.
The sharpness is caused by the asymptotics of the Aleksandrov \(m \)-width of the compact set of \(C^{\,\infty } \)-smooth functions that contains the exact solution
of the problem. This asymptotics is presented by a function that exponentially decays as
the integer parameter \(m\) grows.

It is based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient and includes an elastic response, dissipation and linear hardening. The focus lies on deformation theory of plasticity, which corresponds to a single time step in the variational formulation of the incremental problem. The formation of microstructures in different regions of phase space is analyzed, and it is shown that first-order laminates play an important role in the regime, where both dissipation and hardening are relevant, with second- and third-order laminates reducing the energy even further. No numerical evidence for laminates of order four or higher is found. For large shear and bulk modulus, numerical convergence to the rigid-plastic regime is verified. The main tool is an algorithm for the efficient search for optimal microstructures, which are determined by minimization of the condensed energy.

492,The Numerical dysfunction,"This article proposes, as steps necessary to reverse present trends towards popular innumeracy, that

the adoption of SI metric basic and secondary units of measurement should be everywhere encouraged, being much better suited to popular use than the units traditionally used in the major English-speaking countries,


the SI metric scaling system should be replaced by a simple system for representing scaled numbers, and


traditional methods of representing numbers are otherwise unsatisfactory and warrant being replaced.


A primary source of good advice about reform in popular usage for numbers, and measurements, and calculations should be the mathematicians, whose profession stands to gain most from wise reform, even if the choice and timing of those reforms are properly a matter for the public and its government to decide. Reforms of this kind would offer an opportunity to improve the aesthetics of mathematics generally, an aspect often considered fundamental for mathematicians [4, ch.5]. Mathematicians also have a natural responsibility for taking initiatives in promoting such reforms, and promptly introducing the teaching of them.There is a very real danger that increasing and widening use of digital technology will prolong unthinking arceptance of a defective system for representing numbers. The essential beauty of numbers and calculation is being hidden from the vast majority of people through persistence with notational conventions whose only justification is their traditional use, and whose ugliness and unwieldiness are obscured by the familiarity engendered through imposition in elementary schools.The opportunity is for a much better notational convention to be agreed internationally, for better electronic measurement and calculation to be enabled by that convention, and for the technology to support better the promotion of public numeracy.",Neville Holmes,The Mathematical Intelligencer,2000,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03024441,"Prefix,Mathematical Intelligencer,Notational Convention,Common Fraction,Fraction Point"

494,Numerical analysis of differential operators on raw point clouds,"3D acquisition devices acquire object surfaces with growing accuracy by obtaining 3D point samples of the surface. This sampling depends on the geometry of the device and of the scanned object and is therefore very irregular. Many numerical schemes have been proposed for applying PDEs to regularly meshed 3D data. Nevertheless, for high precision applications it remains necessary to compute differential operators on raw point clouds prior to any meshing. Indeed differential operators such as the mean curvature or the principal curvatures provide crucial information for the orientation and meshing process itself. This paper reviews a half dozen local schemes which have been proposed to compute discrete curvature-like shape indicators on raw point clouds. All of them will be analyzed mathematically in a unified framework by computing their asymptotic form when the size of the neighborhood tends to zero. They are given in terms of the principal curvatures or of higher order intrinsic differential operators which, in return, characterize the discrete operators. All considered local schemes are of two kinds: either they perform a polynomial local regression, or they compute directly local moments. But the polynomial regression of order 1 is demonstrated to play a special role, because its iterations yield a scale space. This analysis is completed with numerical experiments comparing the accuracies of these schemes. We demonstrate that this accuracy is enhanced for all operators by applying previously the scale space.",Julie Digne1 & Jean-Michel Morel,Numerische Mathematik,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-013-0584-y,"68U05,65D18"

No local orthogonality properties are needed for the projection-interpolation operator.

503,A Numerical Study of Diagonally Split Runge–Kutta Methods for PDEs with Discontinuities,"
Diagonally split Runge–Kutta (DSRK) time discretization methods are a class of implicit time-stepping schemes which offer both high-order convergence and a form of nonlinear stability known as unconditional contractivity. This combination is not possible within the classes of Runge–Kutta or linear multistep methods and therefore appears promising for the strong stability preserving (SSP) time-stepping community which is generally concerned with computing oscillation-free numerical solutions of PDEs. Using a variety of numerical test problems, we show that although second- and third-order unconditionally contractive DSRK methods do preserve the strong stability property for all time step-sizes, they suffer from order reduction at large step-sizes. Indeed, for time-steps larger than those typically chosen for explicit methods, these DSRK methods behave like first-order implicit methods. This is unfortunate, because it is precisely to allow a large time-step that we choose to use implicit methods. These results suggest that unconditionally contractive DSRK methods are limited in usefulness as they are unable to compete with either the first-order backward Euler method for large step-sizes or with Crank–Nicolson or high-order explicit SSP Runge–Kutta methods for smaller step-sizes.

We also present stage order conditions for DSRK methods and show that the observed order reduction is associated with the necessarily low stage order of the unconditionally contractive DSRK methods.

511,"Comparison of models for finite plasticity: A numerical study
",We introduce a general framework for the numerical approximation of finite multiplicative plasticity. The method is based on a fully implicit discretization in time which results in an iteratively evaluated stress response; the arising nonlinear problem is then solved by a Newton method where the linear subproblems are solved with a parallel multigrid method. The procedure is applied to models with different elastic free energy functionals and a plastic flow rule of von Mises type. In addition these models are compared to a recently derived frame indifferent approximation of finite multiplicative plasticity valid for small elastic strains which leads to linear balance equations. Rate independent and rate dependent realizations of the former models are considered. We demonstrate by various 3D simulations that the choice of the elastic free energy is not essential (for material parameters representative for metals) and that the new model gives the same response quantitatively and qualitatively as the standard models.,Patrizio Neff1 & Christian Wieners,Computing and Visualization in Science,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00791-003-0104-1,"Plastic Flow,Newton Method,Multigrid Method,Flow Rule,Energy Functional"

514,Numerical Analysis of the Unsteady Natural Convection MHD Couette Nanofluid Flow in the Presence of Thermal Radiation Using Single and Two-Phase Nanofluid Models for Cu–Water Nanofluids,"
The unsteady Couette nanofluid flow with heat transfer is investigated numerically for copper–water nanofluids under the combined effects of thermal radiation and a uniform transverse magnetic field with variable thermo-physical properties, in the case where the flow is established vertically between two parallel plates, so that one of them has an accelerated motion. The homogeneous single-phase model (i.e., Tiwari and Das’s nanofluid model) and the two-phase mixture model (i.e., Buongiorno’s nanofluid model) are utilized in this study together with Corcione’s model to further investigate and clarify the differences between those models and evaluate the validity of the single-phase model for studying the unsteady natural convection MHD Couette nanofluid flow with thermal radiation. In this investigation, we assume that the studied nanofluid is electrically conducting and has a Newtonian rheological behavior. The nonlinear dynamical system of partial differential equations are solved numerically by means of the Gear–Chebyshev–Gauss–Lobatto collocation technique for zero nanoparticles mass flux and no-slip impermeable conditions at the isothermal vertical plates. In a special case, the present numerical solution is also validated analytically and numerically with the earlier available results. For both nanofluid models, the effects of major parameters on the dimensionless velocity, temperature and volumetric fraction of nanoparticles are analysed via representative profiles, whereas the skin friction factor and the heat transfer rate are estimated numerically and discussed through tabular illustrations.","Abderrahim Wakif

Specifically, a convergence analysis is provided with convergence rate estimates in terms of the number of Monte Carlo samples of the solution to the considered diffusion equation and in terms of the total number of degrees of freedom of the spatial discretization, and with bounds for the total work required by the algorithm in the case of Finite Element discretizations.

A typical insurance contract for an insurer in this model is a life annuity in exchange for the transfer of the inheritance right to policyholder’s property to the insurance company. The model is treated as dual with respect to the Cramér–Lundberg classical model. In the structure of an insurance risk process, this is expressed by positive random jumps (compound Poisson process) and a linearly decreasing deterministic component corresponding to pension payments. In the case of exponentially distributed jump sizes, it is shown that the survival probability regarded as a function of initial surplus defined on the nonnegative real half-line is a solution of a singular boundary value problem for an integro-differential equation with a non-Volterra integral operator. The existence and uniqueness of a solution to this problem is proved. Asymptotic representations of the survival probability for small and large values of the initial surplus are obtained. An efficient algorithm for the numerical evaluation of the solution is proposed. Numerical results are presented, and their economic interpretation is given. Namely, it is shown that, in pension insurance, investment in risky assets plays an important role in an increase of the company’s solvency for small values of initial surplus.","T. A. Belkina1, N.

536,Harvesting and seeding of stochastic populations: analysis and numerical approximation,"We study an ecosystem of interacting species that are influenced by random environmental fluctuations. At any point in time, we can either harvest or seed (repopulate) species. Harvesting brings an economic gain while seeding incurs a cost. The problem is to find the optimal harvesting-seeding strategy that maximizes the expected total income from harvesting minus the cost one has to pay for the seeding of various species. In Hening et al. (J Math Biol 79(2):533–570, 2019b) we considered this problem when one has absolute control of the population (infinite harvesting and seeding rates are possible). In many cases, these approximations do not make biological sense and one must consider what happens when one, or both, of the seeding and harvesting rates are bounded. The focus of this paper is the analysis of these three novel settings: bounded seeding and infinite harvesting, bounded seeding and bounded harvesting, and infinite seeding and bounded harvesting. Even one dimensional harvesting problems can be hard to tackle. Once one looks at an ecosystem with more than one species analytical results usually become intractable. In order to gain information regarding the qualitative behavior of the system we develop rigorous numerical approximation methods. This is done by approximating the continuous time dynamics by Markov chains and then showing that the approximations converge to the correct optimal strategy as the mesh size goes to zero. By implementing these numerical approximations, we are able to gain qualitative information about how to best harvest and seed species in specific key examples. We are able to show through numerical experiments that in the single species setting the optimal seeding-harvesting strategy is always of threshold type. This means there are thresholds \(0<L_1<L_2<\infty \) such that: (1) if the population size is ‘low’, so that it lies in \((0, L_1]\), there is seeding using the maximal seeding rate; (2) if the population size ‘moderate’, so that it lies in \((L_1,L_2)\), there is no harvesting or seeding; (3) if the population size is ‘high’, so that it lies in the interval \([L_2, \infty )\), there is harvesting using the maximal harvesting rate. Once we have a system with at least two species, numerical experiments show that constant threshold strategies are not optimal anymore. Suppose there are two competing species and we are only allowed to harvest or seed species 1. The optimal strategy of seeding and harvesting will involve lower and upper thresholds \(L_1(x_2)<L_2(x_2)\) which depend on the density \(x_2\) of species 2.",Alexandru Hening1 & Ky Quan Tran,Journal of Mathematical Biology,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-020-01502-0,"Harvesting,Stochastic environment,Density-dependent price,Controlled diffusion,Species seeding"

The dynamics at the population level are formulated as a system of Volterra functional equations coupled to ODE. For this general class, we develop numerical methods to continue equilibria with respect to a parameter, detect transcritical and saddle-node bifurcations and compute curves in parameter planes along which these bifurcations occur. The methods combine curve continuation, ODE solvers and test functions. Finally, we apply the methods to the above models using existing data for Daphnia magna consuming Algae and for Perca fluviatilis feeding on Daphnia magna. In particular, we validate the methods by deriving expressions for equilibria and bifurcations with respect to which we compute errors, and by comparing the obtained curves with curves that were computed earlier with other methods. We also present new curves to show how the methods can easily be applied to derive new biological insight. Schemes of algorithms are included.","Julia Sánchez Sanz

The energy stability estimates are obtained for the above each fully discrete scheme.

544,Numerical Analysis of Markov-Perfect Equilibria with Multiple Stable Steady States: A Duopoly Application with Innovative Firms,"This paper presents a numerical method for the characterization of Markov-perfect equilibria of symmetric differential games exhibiting coexisting stable steady states. The method relying on the calculation of ‘local value functions’ through collocation in overlapping parts of the state space, is applicable for games with multiple state variables. It is applied to analyze a piecewise deterministic game capturing the dynamic competition between two oligopolistic firms, which are active in an established market and invest in R&D. Both R&D investment and an evolving public knowledge stock positively influence a breakthrough probability, where the breakthrough generates the option to introduce an innovative product on the market. Additionally, firms engage in activities influencing the appeal of the established and new product to consumers. Markov-perfect equilibrium profiles are numerically determined for different parameter settings and it is shown that for certain constellations the new product is introduced with probability one if the initial strength of the established market is below a threshold, which depends on the initial level of public knowledge. In case, the initial strength of the established market is above this threshold, and the R&D effort of both firms quickly goes to zero and with a high probability the new product is never introduced. Furthermore, it is shown that after the introduction of the new product the innovator engages in activities weakening the established market, although it is still producing positive quantities of that product.","Herbert Dawid1, Michel Y.

547,Mixed Finite Element-Second Order Upwind Fractional Step Difference Scheme of Darcy–Forchheimer Miscible Displacement and Its Numerical Analysis,"The incompressible miscible displacement of three-dimensional Darcy–Forchheimer flow is discussed in this paper, and the mathematical model is formulated by two partial differential equations, a Darcy–Forchheimer flow equation for the pressure and a convection-diffusion equation for the concentration. The pressure plays an important role and determines the Darcy–Forchheimer velocity. A conservative mixed finite element is used to approximate the pressure and the velocity, and the computational accuracy of Darcy–Forchheimer velocity is improved by one order. A second-order upwind fractional step difference scheme is adopted to obtain the concentration, and numerical oscillation and dispersion are eliminated. Computational work is reduced greatly by decomposing the whole computation into successive one-dimensional subcomputations, where the speedup solvers are used. Applying energy-norm method, operator decomposition, speedup algorithm and induction hypotheses, we derive an optimal second-order estimates in \(L^2\) norm. Numerical experiments are given to show the theoretical accuracy and the applicability for solving actual problems.

548,"Modeling, analysis and numerical solution to malaria fractional model with temporary immunity and relapse","The present paper deals with a fractional-order mathematical epidemic model of malaria transmission accompanied by temporary immunity and relapse. The model is revised by using Caputo fractional operator for the index of memory. We also recommend the utilization of temporary immunity and the possibility of relapse. The theory of locally bounded and Lipschitz is employed to inspect the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the malaria model. It is shown that temporary immunity has a great effect on the dynamical transmission of host and vector populations. The stability analysis of these equilibrium points for fractional-order derivative α and basic reproduction number \(\mathcal{R}_{0}\) is discussed. The model will exhibit a Hopf-type bifurcation. The two control variables are introduced in this model to decrease the number of populations. Mandatory conditions for the control problem are produced. Two types of numerical method via Laplace Adomian decomposition and Runge–Kutta of fourth order for simulating the proposed model with fractional-order derivative are presented. To validate the mathematical results, numerical simulations, sensitivity analysis, convergence analysis, and other important studies are given.

556,Variational projector augmented-wave method: theoretical analysis and preliminary numerical results,"In Kohn–Sham electronic structure computations, wave functions have singularities at nuclear positions. Because of these singularities, plane-wave expansions give a poor approximation of the eigenfunctions. In conjunction with the use of pseudo-potentials, the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method circumvents this issue by replacing the original eigenvalue problem by a new one with the same eigenvalues but smoother eigenvectors. Here a slightly different method, called variational PAW, is proposed and analyzed. This new method allows for a better convergence with respect to the number of plane-waves. Some numerical tests on an idealized case corroborate this efficiency. This work has been recently announced in Blanc et al.

Following Vinter approach (SIAM J Control Optim 31(2):518–538, 1993) and using occupation measures, the optimal control problem is written into a linear programming problem of infinite-dimension (weak formulation). Thanks to Interval arithmetic, we provide a relaxation of this infinite-dimensional linear programming problem by a finite dimensional linear programming problem. A proof that the optimal value of the finite dimensional linear programming problem is a lower bound to the optimal value of the control problem is given. Moreover, according to the fineness of the discretization and the size of the chosen test function family, obtained optimal values of each finite dimensional linear programming problem form a sequence of lower bounds which converges to the optimal value of the initial optimal control problem.

First, the well-posedness and (limited) smoothing property are studied, by using the maximal \(L^p\) regularity of fractional evolution equations and the fractional Grönwall’s inequality. We also show the maximum principle like their conventional local-in-time counterpart, that is, the time-fractional equation preserves the property that the solution only takes value between the wells of the double-well potential when the initial data does the same. Second, after discretizing the fractional derivative by backward Euler convolution quadrature, we develop several unconditionally solvable and stable time stepping schemes, such as a convex splitting scheme, a weighted convex splitting scheme and a linear weighted stabilized scheme. Meanwhile, we study the discrete energy dissipation property (in a weighted average sense), which is important for gradient flow type models, for the two weighted schemes. In addition, we prove the fractional energy dissipation law for the gradient flow associated with a convex free energy. Finally, using a discrete version of fractional Grönwall’s inequality and maximal \(\ell ^p\) regularity, we prove that the convergence rates of those time-stepping schemes are \(O(\tau ^\alpha )\) without any extra regularity assumption on the solution. We also present extensive numerical results to support our theoretical findings and to offer new insight on the time-fractional Allen–Cahn dynamics.

Conditions that guarantee smoothness properties of the value function at each stage are derived. These properties are exploited to approximate such functions by means of certain nonlinear approximation schemes, which include splines of suitable order and Gaussian radial-basis networks with variable centers and widths. The accuracies of suboptimal solutions obtained by combining DP with these approximation tools are estimated.

561,"Mathematical analysis, finite element approximation and numerical solvers for the interaction of 3D reservoirs with 1D wells","We develop a mathematical model for the interaction of a three-dimensional reservoir with the flow through wells, namely narrow cylindrical channels cutting across the reservoir. Leak off or sink effects are taken into account. To enable the simulation of complex configurations featuring multiple wells, we apply a model reduction technique that represents the wells as one-dimensional channels. The challenge in this case is to account for the interaction of the reservoir with the embedded one-dimensional wells. The resulting problem consists of coupled partial differential equations defined on manifolds with heterogeneous dimensionality. The existence and regularity of weak solutions of such problem is thoroughly addressed. Afterwards, we focus on the numerical discretization of the problem in the framework of the finite element method. We notice that the numerical scheme does not require conformity between the computational mesh of the reservoir and the one of the wells. From the standpoint of the solvers, we discuss the application of multilevel algorithms, such as the algebraic multigrid method. Finally, the reduced mathematical model and the discretization method is applied to a few configurations of reservoir with wells, with the purpose of verifying the theoretical properties and to assess the generality of the approach.","Daniele Cerroni1, Federica Laurino1,2 & Paolo Zunino

MHD applications require substantially more efficient numerical methods than currently exist. In this paper, we construct two decoupled methods based on the artificial compression method (uncoupling the pressure and velocity) and partitioned method (uncoupling the velocity and electric potential) for magnetohydrodynamics flows at low magnetic Reynolds numbers. The methods we study allow us at each time step to solve linear problems, uncoupled by physical processes, per time step, which can greatly improve the computational efficiency.

In particular, we focus on the numerical stability region and the Mittag–Leffler stability. Using the boundary locus technique, we first derive the exact expression of the numerical stability region in the parameter plane, and show that the fractional backward Euler scheme is not \(\tau (0)\)-stable, which is different from the backward Euler scheme for integer DDE models. Secondly, we prove the numerical Mittag–Leffler stability for the numerical solutions provided that the parameters fall into the numerical stability region, by employing the singularity analysis of generating function. Our results show that the numerical solutions of F-DDEs are completely different from the classical integer order DDEs, both in terms of \(\tau (0)\)-stability and the long-time decay rate. Numerical examples are given to confirm the theoretical results.

569,The Roughness and Smoothness of Numerical Solutions to the Stochastic Heat Equation,"The stochastic heat equation is the heat equation driven by white noise. We consider its numerical solutions using the finite difference method. Its true solutions are Hölder continuous with parameter \((\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon)\) in the space variable, and \((\frac{1}{4}-\epsilon)\) in the time variable. We show that the numerical solutions share this property in the sense that they have non-trivial limiting quadratic variation in x and quartic variation in t. These variations are discontinuous functionals on the space of continuous functions, so it is not automatic that the limiting values exist, and not surprising that they depend on the exact numerical schemes that are used; it requires a very careful choice of scheme to get the correct limiting values. In particular, part of the folklore of the subject says that a numerical scheme with excessively long time-steps makes the solution much smoother. We make this precise by showing exactly how the length of the time-steps affects the quadratic and quartic variations.",Yuxiang Chong1 & John B.

This semi-numerical scheme is not restricted by space discretization and allows the computation of a solution at any time without compromising numerical stability or the mass conservation principle. Our formulation results in a non-analytically-solvable second-order differential equation whose spatial discretization yields a tridiagonal linear algebraic system. Moreover, we describe comparisons between semi-numerical and semi-analytical solutions for particular cases. Results agree well with those from semi-analytic solutions. Furthermore, we expose a parametric analysis from the coupled model in order to show the effects of relevant parameters on pressure profiles and flow rates for the case where neither analytic nor semi-analytic solutions are available.","E.

575,A Survey of Methods Available for the Numerical Optimization of Continuous Dynamic Systems,"There has been significant progress in the development of numerical methods for the determination of optimal trajectories for continuous dynamic systems, especially in the last 20 years. In the 1980s, the principal contribution was new methods for discretizing the continuous system and converting the optimization problem into a nonlinear programming problem. This has been a successful approach that has yielded optimal trajectories for very sophisticated problems. In the last 15–20 years, researchers have applied a qualitatively different approach, using evolutionary algorithms or metaheuristics, to solve similar parameter optimization problems. Evolutionary algorithms use the principle of “survival of the fittest” applied to a population of individuals representing candidate solutions for the optimal trajectories. Metaheuristics optimize by iteratively acting to improve candidate solutions, often using stochastic methods. In this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of these recently developed methods are described and an attempt is made to answer the question of what is now the best extant numerical solution method.",Bruce A.

576,Rotating waves in simple scalar excitable media: approximations and numerical solutions,"Rotating waves, in a two-dimensional annular region, are studied using a number of semi-analytical methods. For our kinetics, we use a simple one-variable phase model that arises as the normal form in the transition between excitability and oscillation at a saddle-node invariant circle (SNIC) bifurcation. After deriving asymptotic expressions for the scalar dispersion relationship, we use this to compare the approximations to a direct numerical simulation of the governing nonlinear partial differential equation. All of the approximation methods are based on writing the full solution \(u(t,r,\theta )\) as \(V(\varOmega t - \theta + \phi (r))\) + “perturbation” terms where V is some function and \(\phi (r)\) is the radial phase shift. Finding an expression for the radial phase shift is the main aim of this paper. It is found that the total twist of the spiral is not a monotone function of the excitability. The largest twist occurs in the vicinity of the transition from excitable to oscillatory behavior.",B. Ermentrout1 & B. I.

577,Numerical Stability in the Presence of Variable Coefficients,"The main concern of this paper is with the stable discretisation of linear partial differential equations of evolution with time-varying coefficients. We commence by demonstrating that an approximation of the first derivative by a skew-symmetric matrix is fundamental in ensuring stability for many differential equations of evolution. This motivates our detailed study of skew-symmetric differentiation matrices for univariate finite-difference methods. We prove that, in order to sustain a skew-symmetric differentiation matrix of order \(p\ge 2\), a grid must satisfy \(2p-3\) polynomial conditions. Moreover, once it satisfies these conditions, it supports a banded skew-symmetric differentiation matrix of this order and of the bandwidth \(2p-1\), which can be derived in a constructive manner. Some applications require not just skew-symmetry, but also that the growth in the elements of the differentiation matrix is at most linear in the number of unknowns. This is always true for our tridiagonal matrices of order 2 but need not be true otherwise, a subject which we explore further. Another subject which we examine is the existence and practical construction of grids that support skew-symmetric differentiation matrices of a given order. We resolve this issue completely for order-two methods. We conclude the paper with a list of open problems and their discussion.",Ernst Hairer1 & Arieh Iserles,Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-015-9263-y,"Partial differential equations,Finite-difference methods,Numerical stability,Skew-symmetric differentiation matrices,Order conditions"

Furthermore, to overcome the time step restrictions imposed by the stiff source terms, we devise time-stepping routines based on implicit-explicit (IMEX)-Runge Kutta (RK) schemes. The special structure of the two-fluid plasma equations is exploited by us to design IMEX schemes in which only local (in each cell) linear equations need to be solved at each time step.

We present a computational framework for simulating this motion which relies on a physical model due to Mullins [33, 26], according to which the grain boundaries and the external surfaces are governed by mean curvature motion and surface diffusion, respectively, and along the thermal grooves where the grain boundaries and the exterior surfaces couple, balance of mechanical forces, continuity of the chemical potential, and balance of mass flux dictate the boundary conditions. By adopting an equi-spaced parametric description for the evolving surfaces [40, 13], the physical model can be formulated as a coupled systems of ODEs and PDEs.We propose a finite difference algorithm based on staggered grids for solving the resultant system, which we implement on a polycrystalline layer with columnar structure containing three grains, assuming isotropy. Our algorithm, which is second order accurate in space and first order accurate in time, conserves mass, dissipates energy, and satisfies the predictions of Mullins[33], von Neumann-Mullins [32, 51] and Génin, Mullins, Wynblatt [22], in appropriate limits. Effects such as pitting, hole formation, grain annihilation, wetting, and dewetting can be analyzed using our approach [15, 14, 17, 16].","Vadim Derkach1, Amy Novick-Cohen1 & Arkady Vilenkin",Journal of Elliptic and Parabolic Equations,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03377411,"Primary: 06B10,Secondary: 06D05"

The relationship between the orientation distribution function and particle orientation angles was obtained. The results show that comparing with the most probable angle distribution which comes to being in short time, the distribution of the steady state doesn't vary much in range; the main difference is the anti-clockwise rotation in the right and upper field, that is, particles rotate more at the points where the velocity gradients are larger. The most probable orientations are close to the direction of local streamlines. In the direction of streamlines, with poleradius decreasing, the most probable angles increase, but the angles between their orientations and the local streamlines decrease.",Lin Jian-zhong Professor1 & Zhang Ling-xin Doctorial student,Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02437795,"cylindrical particle suspension,wedge-shaped flow,orientation distribution function,most probable angle,numerical simulation"

595,Mathematical and numerical analyses of a stochastic impulse control model with imperfect interventions,"A stochastic impulse control problem with imperfect controllability of interventions is formulated with an emphasis on applications to ecological and environmental management problems. The imperfectness comes from uncertainties with respect to the magnitude of interventions. Our model is based on a dynamic programming formalism to impulsively control a 1-D diffusion process of a geometric Brownian type. The imperfectness leads to a non-local operator different from the many conventional ones, and evokes a slightly different optimal intervention policy. We give viscosity characterizations of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman Quasi-Variational Inequality (HJBQVI) governing the value function focusing on its numerical computation. Uniqueness and verification results of the HJBQVI are presented and a candidate exact solution is constructed. The HJBQVI is solved with the two different numerical methods, an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based method and a finite difference scheme, demonstrating their consistency. Furthermore, the resulting controlled dynamics are extensively analyzed focusing on a bird population management case from a statistical standpoint.","Hidekazu Yoshioka

614,Numerical approximation of connecting orbits with asymptotic rate," In this paper we set up and analyze a numerical method for so called {\bf connecting orbits with asymptotic rate } in parameterized dynamical systems. A connecting orbit with asymptotic rate has its initial value in a given submanifold of the phase space (or its cross product with parameter space) and it converges with an exponential rate to a given orbit, e. g. a steady state or a periodic orbit. It is well known that orbits with asymptotic rate can be used to foliate stable or strong stable manifolds of invariant sets. We show that the problem of determining a connecting orbit with asymptotic rate is well-posed if a certain transversality condition is made and a specific relation between the number of stable dimensions and the number of parameters holds. For the proof we employ the implicit function theorem in spaces of exponentially decaying functions. Using asymptotic boundary conditions we truncate the original problem to a finite interval and show that the error decays exponentially. Typically the asymptotic boundary conditions by themselves are the result of a boundary value problem, e. g. if the limiting orbit is periodic. Thus it is expensive to calculate them in a parameter dependent way during the approximation procedure. To avoid this we develop a boundary corrector method which turns out to be nearly optimal after very few steps.",Thorsten Pampel,Numerische Mathematik,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002110100302,"Mathematics Subject Classification (1991): 58F22, 65L10, 58F18, 34C37"

In the present study, the temporal evolution of the Rayleigh–Taylor instability of a miscible high-density slice in a porous medium is analyzed theoretically using nonlinear numerical simulations. Nonlinear governing equations are derived and solved with the Fourier spectral method. To connect the previous linear stability analysis and the present nonlinear simulation, the most unstable disturbance which was identified in the linear analysis is employed as an initial condition for the nonlinear study. In contrast to the fingering between two semi-infinite regions, the nonlinear fingering of a finite slice is influenced by the depth of the high-density region. The present nonlinear analysis shows that there exists a critical depth below which the system is linearly unstable, but nonlinear phenomena cannot be expected. The nonlinear simulation results show that nonlinear competition yields a series of cells of slightly different widths and amplitudes. Also, it is found that the upper stable region hinders the development of instability motions and stabilizes the system.",Min Chan Kim,Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-015-9835-5,"Fourier spectral method,Miscible slice,Nonlinear simulation,Rayleigh–Taylor instability"
616,Laplacian Instability of Planar Streamer Ionization Fronts—An Example of Pulled Front Analysis,"Streamer ionization fronts are pulled fronts that propagate into a linearly unstable state; the spatial decay of the initial condition of a planar front selects dynamically one specific long-time attractor out of a continuous family. A stability analysis for perturbations in the transverse direction has to take these features into account. In this paper we show how to apply the Evans function in a weighted space for this stability analysis. Zeros of the Evans function indicate the intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds; they are used to determine the eigenvalues. Within this Evans function framework, we define a numerical dynamical systems method for the calculation of the dispersion relation as an eigenvalue problem. We also derive dispersion curves for different values of the electron diffusion constant and of the electric field ahead of the front. Numerical solutions of the initial value problem confirm the eigenvalue calculations. The numerical work is complemented with an analysis of the Evans function leading to analytical expressions for the dispersion relation in the limit of small and large wave numbers. The paper concludes with a fit formula for intermediate wave numbers. This empirical fit supports the conjecture that the smallest unstable wave length of the Laplacian instability is proportional to the diffusion length that characterizes the leading edge of the pulled ionization front.","Gianne Derks1, Ute Ebert2,3 & Bernard Meulenbroek2,",Journal of Nonlinear Science,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00332-008-9023-0,"Pulled front,Stability analysis,Streamer ionization front,Dispersion relation,Wave selection of Laplacian instability"

In Khanna (J Sci Comput 56(2):366–380, 2013), it was emphasized that high-precision arithmetic and high-order methods are required to capture numerically the correct decaying rate of the late-time radiative tails of black-hole system in order to prevent roundoff errors from inducing a wrong power-law decay rate in the numerical approximation. In this paper, we explain how roundoff errors induce a wrong decay mode in the numerical approximation using simple linear differential equations.

Some numerical issues with such simulations are investigated, and it is shown that very high resolution (hundreds of points in the reaction zone) are required for highly accurate (converged) solutions. High-resolution simulations are then used to investigate thequalitative dependences of the detonation driving zone structure on the diameter and degree of confinement of the explosive charge. The simulation results are used to show that, given the radius of curvature of the shock at the charge axis, the steady detonation speed and the axial solution are accurately predicted by a quasi-one-dimensional theory, even for cases where the detonation propagates at speeds significantly below the Chapman-Jouguet speed.

623,Numerical Experiments on Extreme Waves Through Oblique–Soliton Interactions,"Extreme water-wave motion is investigated analytically and numerically by considering two-soliton and three-soliton interactions on a horizontal plane. We successfully determine numerically that soliton solutions of the unidirectional Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equation (KPE), with equal far-field individual amplitudes, survive reasonably well in the bidirectional and higher-order Benney–Luke equations (BLE). A well-known exact two-soliton solution of the KPE on the infinite horizontal plane is used to seed the BLE at an initial time, and we confirm that the KPE-fourfold amplification approximately persists. More interestingly, a known three-soliton solution of the KPE is analysed further to assess its eight- or ninefold amplification, the latter of which exists in only a special and difficult-to-attain limit. This solution leads to an extreme splash at one point in space and time. Subsequently, we seed the BLE with this three-soliton solution at a suitable initial time to establish the maximum amplification: it is approximately 7.8 for a KPE amplification of 8.4. Herein, the computational domain and solutions are truncated approximately to a fully periodic or half-periodic channel geometry of sufficient size, essentially leading to cnoidal-wave solutions. Moreover, special geometric (finite-element) variational integrators in space and time have been used in order to eradicate artificial numerical damping of, in particular, wave amplitude.","J.

624,Numerical Modelling of the Dynamics of a Cylindrical Turbulent Patch in a Longitudinal Shear Flow,"AbstractBased on a modified two-equation model of turbulence, the numerical model of the dynamics of a cylindrical localized zone of turbulent mixing in a longitudinal uniform shear flow of homogeneous fluid is constructed. The results of the numerical experiments demonstrate significant turbulent energy generation caused by the effect of the shear flow. The question of the similarity of the flow with respect to the shear Froude number is considered. The results of the numerical experiments show the similarity of the flow for large values of this parameter, which correspond to small values of the velocity gradients of the shear flow.","A. V.

625,Numerical differentiation procedures for non-exact data,"The numerical differentiation of data divides naturally into two distinct problems:

(i)
the differentiation of exact data, and


(ii)
the differentiation of non-exact (experimental) data.


In this paper, we examine the latter. Because methods developed for exact data are based on abstract formalisms which are independent of the structure within the data, they prove, except for the regularization procedure of Cullum, to be unsatisfactory for non-exact data. We therefore adopt the point of view that satisfactory methods for non-exact data must take the structure within the data into account in some natural way, and use the concepts of regression and spectrum analysis as a basis for the development of such methods. The regression procedure is used when either the structure within the non-exact data is known on independent grounds, or the assumptions which underlie the spectrum analysis procedure [viz., stationarity of the (detrended) data] do not apply. In this latter case, the data could be modelled using splines. The spectrum analysis procedure is used when the structure within the nonexact data (or a suitable transformation of it, where the transformation can be differentiated exactly) behaves as if it were generated by a stationary stochastic process. By proving that the regularization procedure of Cullum is equivalent to a certain spectrum analysis procedure, we derive a fast Fourier transform implementation for regularization (based on this equivalence) in which an acceptable value of the regularization parameter is estimated directly from a time series formulation based on this equivalence. Compared with the regularization procedure, which involvesO(n
3) operations (wheren is the number of data points), the fast Fourier transform implementation only involvesO(n logn).", R. S. Anderssen1 &  P.

626,A Detailed Numerical Investigation for Various Types of Entropy Generation and Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Free Convection within a Corrugated Cavity Comprising Nanofluid and a Hot Object Positioned in the Middle,"This work gives a detailed analysis of the entropy generations resulting from MHD free convection within a cavity carrying nanofluid and a hot object situated in the middle. A Cu-Water nanofluid fills the cavity while its bottom and upper corrugated walls are supposed adiabatic. Governing equations constructed in dimensionless variables which have been discretized by finite volume method FVM with the employment of SIMPLE algorithm. The heat transfer characteristics, the average and locale entropy generated by heat transfer \({\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{HT}}\), fluid friction \({\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{FF}}\) and magnetic field \({\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{MF}}\) are calculated and drawn for different Rayleigh numbers \(\left({10}^{3}\le \mathrm{Ra}\le {10}^{6}\right)\), Hartmann numbers \(\left(0\le \mathrm{Ha}\le 45\right)\), volume fractions of nanoparticles \(\left(0{\%}\le \varvec{\varphi }\le 5{\%}\right)\) and the undulations number \((1\le \mathrm{N}\le 3)\). Also the profiles of horizontal U and vertical V velocities, temperature variation \(\uptheta \), the rate of heat transfer, the nanofluid maximum stream function \({\left({\psi }_{max}\right)}_{nf}\) and the isothermal profiles are drawn. Numerical findings have revealed that by increasing the Hartmann number, the average Nusselt number and entropy production changed. It has been demonstrated that the inclusion of increased proportions of copper nanoparticles causes a notable development of entropy and also in relation to heat transfer. Additionally, the rise of nanoparticles percentage in the base fluid often leads to loss of thermal efficiency. Moreover, for the most cases, adding of nanoparticles to the base fluid results in increased entropy generation, and for all Rayleigh number, making the cavity wall more ripple also supports the increase in the heat exchange rate. It is also observed that the effect of the number N of undulations becomes progressively negligible with the rise in the magnetic field Ha. Furthermore, in conductive regime \((\mathrm{Ra}<{10}^{5})\), the optimal heat transfer rate is achieved for \(\varvec{\varphi }=5{\%}\), conversely, when the regime is convective \((\mathrm{Ra}\ge {10}^{5})\), the rate of heat transfer and the mean entropy production can be optimized. In general the rise of corrugations number, and Rayleigh number leads to increase the heat transfer rate and the mean entropy generation.","Zoubair Boulahia

627,Fully Adaptive Multiscale Schemes for Conservation Laws Employing Locally Varying Time Stepping,"In recent years the concept of fully adaptive multiscale finite volume schemes for conservation laws has been developed and analytically investigated. Here the grid adaptation is performed by means of a multiscale analysis. So far, all cells are evolved in time using the same time step size. In the present work this concept is extended incorporating locally varying time stepping. A general strategy is presented for explicit as well as implicit time discretization. The efficiency and the accuracy of the proposed concept is verified numerically.",Siegfried Müller1 & Youssef Stiriba,Journal of Scientific Computing,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-006-9102-z,"Multiscale techniques,local grid refinement,locally varying time stepping,finite volume schemes,conservation laws"
628,Two Dimensional Analysis of Hybrid Spectral/Finite Difference Schemes for Linearized Compressible Navier–Stokes Equations,"This study seeks to compare different combinations of spatial dicretization methods under a coupled spatial temporal framework in two dimensional wavenumber space. The aim is to understand the effect of dispersion and dissipation on both the convection and diffusion terms found in the two dimensional linearized compressible Navier–Stokes Equations (LCNSE) when a hybrid finite difference/Fourier spectral scheme is used in the x and y directions. In two dimensional wavespace, the spectral resolution becomes a function of both the wavenumber and the wave propagation angle, the orientation of the wave front with respect to the grid. At sufficiently low CFL number where temporal discretization effects can be neglected, we show that a hybrid finite difference/Fourier spectral schemes is more accurate than a full finite difference method for the two dimensional advection equation, but that this is not so in the case of the LCNSE. Group velocities, phase velocities as well as numerical amplification factor were used to quantify the numerical anisotropy of the dispersion and dissipation properties. Unlike the advection equation, the dispersion relation representing the acoustic modes of the LCNSE contains an acoustic terms in addition to its advection and viscous terms. This makes the group velocity in each spatial direction a function of the wavenumber in both spatial directions. This can lead to conditions for which a hybrid Fourier spectral/finite difference method can become less or more accurate than a full finite difference method. To better understand the comparison of the dispersion properties between a hybrid and full FD scheme, the integrated sum of the error between the numerical group velocity \(V^{*}_{grp,full}\) and the exact solution across all wavenumbers for a range of wave propagation angle is examined. In the comparison between a hybrid and full FD discretization schemes, the fourth order central (CDS4), fourth order dispersion relation preserving (DRP4) and sixth order central compact (CCOM6) schemes share the same characteristics. At low wave propagation angle, the integrated errors of the full FD and hybrid discretization schemes remain the same. At intermediate wave propagation angle, the integrated error of the full FD schemes become smaller than that of the hybrid scheme. At large wave propagation angle, the integrated error of the full FD schemes diverges while the integrated error of the hybrid discretization schemes converge to zero. At high reduced wavenumber and sufficiently low CFL number where temporal discretization error can be neglected, it was found that the numerical dissipation of the viscous term based on the CDS4, DRP4, CCOM6 and isotropy optimized CDS4 schemes (\(\hbox {CDS4}_{{opt}}\)) schemes was lower than the actual physical dissipation, which is only a function of the cell Reynolds number. The wave propagation angle at which the numerical dissipation of the viscous term approaches its maximum occurs at \(\pi /4\) for the CDS4, DRP4, CCOM6 and \(\hbox {CDS4}_{{opt}}\) schemes.","Raynold Tan

630,Asymptotic analysis of the steady-state and time-dependent Berman problem,"The Berman problem for two-dimensional flow of a viscous fluid through an infinite channel is studied. Fluid motion is driven by uniform suction (or injection) of fluid through the upper channel wall, and is characterised by a Reynolds number R; the lower wall is impermeable. A similarity solution in which the streamfunction takes the form \(\psi = - x\mathcal{F}(y,t)\) is examined, where x and y are coordinates parallel to and normal to the channel walls, respectively. The function \(\mathcal{F}\) satisfies the Riabouchinsky–Proudman–Johnson equation, a partial differential equation in y and t; steady flows satisfy an ordinary differential equation in y. The steady states are computed numerically and the asymptotics of these solutions described in the limits of small wall suction or injection, large wall injection and large wall suction, the last of these being given more concisely and more accurately than in previous treatments. In the time-dependent problem, the solution appears to be attracted to a limit cycle when R≫1 (large wall suction). This solution has been computed numerically for ε=1/R down to 0⋅011, but the structure of the solution makes further numerical progress currently infeasible. The limit cycle consists of several phases, some with slow and others with very rapid evolution. During one of the rapid phases, the solution achieves a large amplitude, and this feature of the solution lies behind the practical difficulties encountered in numerical simulations. The profile of the solution is plotted during the various phases and corresponding asymptotic descriptions are given. An exact solution to the Riabouchinsky–Proudman–Johnson equation covers most of the phases, although separate discussion is required of the boundary layers near the two walls and an interior layer near a zero of \(\mathcal{F}\). Particular consideration is required when this zero approaches the upper channel wall.",J.R. King1 & S.M.

The chaos here is in the sense of topological horseshoe and is obtained for certain range of parameter values by applying a recent result from [5].

632,The piecewise linear-quadratic model for computational convex analysis,"
A new computational framework for computer-aided convex analysis is proposed and investigated. Existing computational frameworks are reviewed and their limitations pointed out. The class of piecewise linear-quadratic functions is introduced to improve convergence and stability. A stable convex calculus is achieved using symbolic-numeric algorithms to compute all fundamental transforms of convex analysis. Our main result states the existence of efficient (linear time) algorithms for the class of piecewise linear-quadratic functions. We also recall that such class is closed under convex transforms. We illustrate the results with numerical examples, and validate numerically the resulting computational framework.

647,The ideal flip-through impact: experimental and numerical investigation,"Results from a physical experiment and a numerical computation are compared for a flip-through type wave impact on a vertical face, typical of a seawall or breakwater. The physical wave was generated by application of the focused-wave group technique to the amplitudes of a JONSWAP spectrum, with the focus location adjusted to produce a near-breaking wave impact with no discernible air entrainment or entrapment. Details of the resultant impact are presented in the form of high-speed video, pressure transducer and wave gauge records. Numerical reproduction of the wave transformation and impact is achieved by application of a linear wave-analysis model and a fully nonlinear potential-flow solver. Although more advanced models exist, use of the latter model type is interesting as (1) it was applied by Cooker and Peregrine (Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Coastal Engineering, 164–176, 1990) in their original numerical discovery of the flip-through impact and (2) the assumptions behind the potential-flow model remain reasonably valid, until the flip-through jet begins to break into droplets. In the present study, the potential-flow model has been extended with the Schwarz–Christoffel conformal mapping, to allow a piece-wise linearly shaped mound geometry. Further, an ad-hoc wave-generation technique has been added, to facilitate an adequate numerical reproduction of long second-order waves in the flume. Free-surface elevations from the potential-flow computations show good agreement with wave gauge data for the wave that produces the flip-through impact. Experimental video frames with the corresponding numerical free-surface profiles overlaid show an excellent match for the flow contraction prior to impact. The deviations between the experiment and numerical solution that occur at the stage of jet formation are discussed and a computation of a slightly weaker impact illustrate the strong sensitivity of impact pressures to the shape of the impacting wave. Ways of improving the numerical description by use of more advanced models are outlined.","H. Bredmose1, A. Hunt-Raby2, R. Jayaratne3 & …G. N.

Substitution of this function into the original equation yields a residual Δ(t) = O(t
N), for which an accurate analytical representation is obtained. In this case, the polynomial quasi-solution is understood as an exact solution in the form of a polynomial of degree N, disturbed because of the residual of the original initial problem.

It is shown that the influence of the heat exchange with environment on the temperature field of a gas-bearing reservoir is localized in a narrow zone near its top and bottom, although the size of this zone increases with time.","V.

653,Applications of the Generalized Fourier Transform in Numerical Linear Algebra,"Equivariant matrices, commuting with a group of permutation matrices, are considered. Such matrices typically arise from PDEs and other computational problems where the computational domain exhibits discrete geometrical symmetries. In these cases, group representation theory provides a powerful tool for block diagonalizing the matrix via the Generalized Fourier Transform (GFT). This technique yields substantial computational savings in problems such as solving linear systems, computing eigenvalues and computing analytic matrix functions such as the matrix exponential.The paper is presenting a comprehensive self contained introduction to this field. Building upon the familiar special (finite commutative) case of circulant matrices being diagonalized with the Discrete Fourier Transform, we generalize the classical convolution theorem and diagonalization results to the noncommutative case of block diagonalizing equivariant matrices.Applications of the GFT in problems with domain symmetries have been developed by several authors in a series of papers. In this paper we elaborate upon the results in these papers by emphasizing the connection between equivariant matrices, block group algebras and noncommutative convolutions. Furthermore, we describe the algebraic structure of projections related to non-free group actions. This approach highlights the role of the underlying mathematical structures, and provides insight useful both for software construction and numerical analysis. The theory is illustrated with a selection of numerical examples.

655,A Third Order Exponential Time Differencing Numerical Scheme for No-Slope-Selection Epitaxial Thin Film Model with Energy Stability,"In this paper we propose and analyze a (temporally) third order accurate exponential time differencing (ETD) numerical scheme for the no-slope-selection (NSS) equation of the epitaxial thin film growth model, with Fourier pseudo-spectral discretization in space. A linear splitting is applied to the physical model, and an ETD-based multistep approximation is used for time integration of the corresponding equation. In addition, a third order accurate Douglas-Dupont regularization term, in the form of \(-A {\Delta t}^2 \phi _0 (L_N) \Delta _N^2 ( u^{n+1} - u^n)\), is added in the numerical scheme. A careful Fourier eigenvalue analysis results in the energy stability in a modified version, and a theoretical justification of the coefficient A becomes available. As a result of this energy stability analysis, a uniform in time bound of the numerical energy is obtained. And also, the optimal rate convergence analysis and error estimate are derived in details, in the \(\ell ^\infty (0,T; H_h^1) \cap \ell ^2 (0,T; H_h^3)\) norm, with the help of a careful eigenvalue bound estimate, combined with the nonlinear analysis for the NSS model. This convergence estimate is the first such result for a third order accurate scheme for a gradient flow. Some numerical simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the numerical scheme and the third order convergence. The long time simulation results for \(\varepsilon =0.02\) (up to \(T=3 \times 10^5\)) have indicated a logarithm law for the energy decay, as well as the power laws for growth of the surface roughness and the mound width. In particular, the power index for the surface roughness and the mound width growth, created by the third order numerical scheme, is more accurate than those produced by certain second order energy stable schemes in the existing literature.","Kelong Cheng1, Zhonghua Qiao2 & Cheng Wang

We construct it by using staggered grids. The transport equations are approximated along characteristics, and quadratic nonlinear functions are linearized using a special selection of staggered grids. The stability analysis proves that a connection between time and space steps arises only due to approximation requirements in order to follow exactly the directions of characteristics. The convergence analysis of this scheme is done in two steps. First, some estimates of the uniform boundedness of the discrete solution are proved. This part of the analysis is done locally, in some neighborhood of the exact solution. Second, on the basis of the obtained estimates, the main stability inequality is proved. The second-order convergence rate with respect to the space and time coordinates follows from this stability estimate. Using the obtained convergence result, we prove that the local stability analysis in the selected neighborhood of the exact solution is sufficient.","R. Čiegis1, A. Dement’ev2 & I.

658,A numerical approach to design control invariant sets for constrained nonlinear discrete-time systems with guaranteed optimality,"A numerical approach to design control invariant sets for constrained nonlinear discrete-time systems with guaranteed optimality is proposed in this paper. The addressed approach is based on the fact that zonotopes are more flexible for representing sets than boxes in interval analysis. Then the solver of set inversion via interval analysis is extended to set inversion via zonotope geometry by introducing the novel idea of bisecting zonotopes. The main feature of the extended solver of set inversion is the bisection and the evolution of a zonotope rather than a box. Thus the shape of admissible domains for set inversion can be broadened from boxes to zonotopes and the wrapping effect can be reduced as well by using the zonotope evolution instead of the interval evolution. Combined with global optimization via interval analysis, the extended solver of set inversion via zonotope geometry is further applied to design control invariant sets for constrained nonlinear discrete-time systems in a numerical way. Finally, the numerical design of a control invariant set and its application to the terminal control of the dual-mode model predictive control are fulfilled on a benchmark Continuous-Stirred Tank Reactor example.","Jian Wan1, Josep Vehi1 & Ningsu Luo",Journal of Global Optimization,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-008-9334-6,"Set inversion,Global optimization,Interval analysis,Zonotope geometry,Control invariant sets"

It is proved that the algorithm using Householder QR decomposition, implemented in floating point arithmetic, is forward stable but only conditionally mixed forward-backward stable. A similar result holds also for the Classical Gram-Schmidt algorithm with reorthogonalization (CGS2). This algorithm was developed and analyzed by Abdelmalek (BIT, 11(4):354–367, 1971) and its detailed error analysis was given in Giraud et al. (Numer. Math. 101(1):87–100, 2005).We incorporate the recent result of Byers and Xu (SIAM J. Matrix Anal.

660,Entropy stable numerical approximations for the isothermal and polytropic Euler equations,"In this work we analyze the entropic properties of the Euler equations when the system is closed with the assumption of a polytropic gas. In this case, the pressure solely depends upon the density of the fluid and the energy equation is not necessary anymore as the mass conservation and momentum conservation then form a closed system. Further, the total energy acts as a convex mathematical entropy function for the polytropic Euler equations. The polytropic equation of state gives the pressure as a scaled power law of the density in terms of the adiabatic index \(\gamma \). As such, there are important limiting cases contained within the polytropic model like the isothermal Euler equations (\(\gamma {=}1\)) and the shallow water equations (\(\gamma {=}2\)). We first mimic the continuous entropy analysis on the discrete level in a finite volume context to get special numerical flux functions. Next, these numerical fluxes are incorporated into a particular discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spectral element framework where derivatives are approximated with summation-by-parts operators. This guarantees a high-order accurate DG numerical approximation to the polytropic Euler equations that is also consistent to its auxiliary total energy behavior. Numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical derivations, i.e., the entropic properties of the high order DG scheme.","Andrew R. Winters

663,A Decoupled Unconditionally Stable Numerical Scheme for the Cahn–Hilliard–Hele-Shaw System,"We propose a novel decoupled unconditionally stable numerical scheme for the simulation of two-phase flow in a Hele-Shaw cell which is governed by the Cahn–Hilliard–Hele-Shaw system (CHHS) with variable viscosity. The temporal discretization of the Cahn–Hilliard equation is based on a convex-splitting of the associated energy functional. Moreover, the capillary forcing term in the Darcy equation is separated from the pressure gradient at the time discrete level by using an operator-splitting strategy. Thus the computation of the nonlinear Cahn–Hilliard equation is completely decoupled from the update of pressure. Finally, a pressure-stabilization technique is used in the update of pressure so that at each time step one only needs to solve a Poisson equation with constant coefficient. We show that the scheme is unconditionally stable. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our scheme.",Daozhi Han,Journal of Scientific Computing,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-015-0055-y,"Cahn–Hilliard–Hele-Shaw,Decoupling,Unconditional stability, Convex-splitting,Operator-splitting"
664,Energy Stable Numerical Schemes for Ternary Cahn-Hilliard System,"We present and analyze a uniquely solvable and unconditionally energy stable numerical scheme for the ternary Cahn-Hilliard system, with a polynomial pattern nonlinear free energy expansion. One key difficulty is associated with presence of the three mass components, though a total mass constraint reduces this to two components. Another numerical challenge is to ensure the energy stability for the nonlinear energy functional in the mixed product form, which turns out to be non-convex, non-concave in the three-phase space. To overcome this subtle difficulty, we add a few auxiliary terms to make the combined energy functional convex in the three-phase space, and this, in turn, yields a convex-concave decomposition of the physical energy in the ternary system. Consequently, both the unique solvability and the unconditional energy stability of the proposed numerical scheme are established at a theoretical level. In addition, an optimal rate convergence analysis in the \(\ell ^\infty (0,T; H_N^{-1}) \cap \ell ^2 (0,T; H_N^1)\) norm is provided, with Fourier pseudo-spectral discretization in space, which is the first such result in this field. To deal with the nonlinear implicit equations at each time step, we apply an efficient preconditioned steepest descent (PSD) algorithm. A second order accurate, modified BDF scheme is also discussed. A few numerical results are presented, which confirm the stability and accuracy of the proposed numerical scheme.","Wenbin Chen1, Cheng Wang

665,A user’s guide to PDE models for chemotaxis,"Mathematical modelling of chemotaxis (the movement of biological cells or organisms in response to chemical gradients) has developed into a large and diverse discipline, whose aspects include its mechanistic basis, the modelling of specific systems and the mathematical behaviour of the underlying equations. The Keller-Segel model of chemotaxis (Keller and Segel in J Theor Biol 26:399–415, 1970; 30:225–234, 1971) has provided a cornerstone for much of this work, its success being a consequence of its intuitive simplicity, analytical tractability and capacity to replicate key behaviour of chemotactic populations. One such property, the ability to display “auto-aggregation”, has led to its prominence as a mechanism for self-organisation of biological systems. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to finite-time blow-up under certain formulations of the model, and a large body of work has been devoted to determining when blow-up occurs or whether globally existing solutions exist. In this paper, we explore in detail a number of variations of the original Keller–Segel model. We review their formulation from a biological perspective, contrast their patterning properties, summarise key results on their analytical properties and classify their solution form.

666,Numerical Applications of the Scaling Concept,"We present a survey of recent developments in the applications of the scaling concept to numerical analysis. In addition, we report on some relevant topics not covered in existing surveys. Therefore, the present work updates and complements the existing surveys on the subject concerned.Applications of the scaling concept are useful in the numerical treatment of both ordinary and partial differential problems. Applications to boundary-value problems governed by ordinary differential equations are mainly related to their transformation into initial-value problems. Within this context, special emphasis is placed on systems of governing equations, eigenvalue, and free boundary-value problems. An error analysis for a truncated boundary formulation of the Blasius problem is also reported. As far as initial-value problems governed by ordinary differential equations are concerned, we discuss the development of adaptive mesh methods. Applications to partial differential problems considered herein are related to the construction of finite-difference schemes for conservations laws, the solution structure of the Riemann problem, rescaling schemes and adaptive schemes for blow-up problems.In writing this paper, our aim was to promote further and more important numerical applications of the scaling concept.

The aim is to control the tumor size through chemotherapy while avoiding the emergence of resistance to the drugs. The numerical approach to solve the problem was the combination of direct methods and continuation on discretization parameters, which happen to be insufficient for the more complicated model, where diffusion is added to account for mutations. In the present paper, we propose an approach relying on changing the problem so that it can theoretically be solved thanks to a Pontryagin’s maximum principle in infinite dimension. This provides an excellent starting point for a much more reliable and efficient algorithm combining direct methods and continuations. The global idea is new and can be thought of as an alternative to other numerical optimal control techniques.","Antoine Olivier

Using the meshfree scheme, the problem is reduced to a system of algebraic equations Ax=b. Moreover, the problem is discretized in time dimension using the Crank-Nicolson approach and also becomes linear. Eventually, due to the property of Compactly Supported Radial Basis Functions (CSRBFs), ”locally supported” property, matrix A will be well-conditioned. The most important advantages of the proposed method can be high accuracy, simplicity of implementation, reasonable speed, and the sparsity property of the coefficients matrix derived from its linear systems, which distinguish the proposed method from other methods.

The paper presents a method for evaluating the effect of express lines on the waiting process. An optimization model is developed which minimizes the average waiting time in line with respect to the maximum number of items allowed in the express lines. The research is based on a real case of a do-it-yourself superstore, but the methodology applied at the store can be used generally.The optimization model includes sensitivity analyses. Sensitivity analyses show how the optimal value of the limit parameter changes if major parameters of the model change. The results of these analyses help managers make decisions about short and medium-term operations of express lines.The major conclusion of the paper is that the optimal operation of express lines does not improve the average waiting time significantly, but the effect of non-optimal operation can be very unfavorable. Therefore, a successful implementation of express lines requires a thorough analysis of operational issues and a careful consideration of perceptional issues as well.","Tamás Koltai1, Noémi Kalló1 & László Lakatos",Optimization and Engineering,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-008-9053-3,"Queuing systems,Express lines,Sensitivity analysis"

672,Error estimators for the position of discontinuities in hyperbolic conservation laws with source terms which are solved using operator splitting,"When computing numerical solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws with source terms, one may obtain spurious solutions — these are unphysical solutions that only occur in numerics such as shock waves moving with wrong speeds, cf. [9], [3], [1], [13], [4]. Therefore it is important to know how errors of the location of a discontinuity can be controlled. To derive appropriate error-estimates and to use them to control such errors, is the aim of our investigations in this paper. We restrict our considerations to numerical solutions which are computed by using a splitting method. In splitting methods, the homogeneous conservation law and an ordinary differential equation (modelling the source term) are solved separately in each time step. Firstly, we derive error-estimates for the scalar Riemann problem. The analysis shows that the local error of the location of a discontinuity mainly consists of two parts. The first part is introduced by the splitting and the second part is due to smearing of the discontinuity. Next, these error-estimates are used to construct an adaptation of the step size so that the error of the location of the discontinuity remains sufficiently small. The adaptation is applied to several examples, which are a scalar problem, a simplified combustion model, and the one-dimensional inviscid reacting compressible Euler equations. All the examples show that the adaptation based on the derived error-estimates works well. The theory can also be extended to planar two-dimensional problems.",R. Jeltsch1 & P.

679,Fractional-Compact Numerical Algorithms for Riesz Spatial Fractional Reaction-Dispersion Equations,"It is well known that using high-order numerical algorithms to solve fractional differential equations leads to almost the same computational cost with low-order ones but the accuracy (or convergence order) is greatly improved due to the nonlocal properties of fractional operators. Therefore, developing some high-order numerical approximation formulas for fractional derivatives plays a more important role in numerically solving fractional differential equations. This paper focuses on constructing (generalized) high-order fractional-compact numerical approximation formulas for Riesz derivatives.

696,Multiresolution Wavelet Based Adaptive Numerical Dissipation Control for High Order Methods,"The recently developed essentially fourth-order or higher low dissipative shock-capturing scheme of Yee, Sandham, and Djomehri [25] aimed at minimizing numerical dissipations for high speed compressible viscous flows containing shocks, shears and turbulence. To detect non-smooth behavior and control the amount of numerical dissipation to be added, Yee et al. employed an artificial compression method (ACM) of Harten [4] but utilize it in an entirely different context than Harten originally intended. The ACM sensor consists of two tuning parameters and is highly physical problem dependent. To minimize the tuning of parameters and physical problem dependence, new sensors with improved detection properties are proposed. The new sensors are derived from utilizing appropriate non-orthogonal wavelet basis functions and they can be used to completely switch off the extra numerical dissipation outside shock layers. The non-dissipative spatial base scheme of arbitrarily high order of accuracy can be maintained without compromising its stability at all parts of the domain where the solution is smooth. Two types of redundant non-orthogonal wavelet basis functions are considered. One is the B-spline wavelet (Mallat and Zhong [14]) used by Gerritsen and Olsson [3] in an adaptive mesh refinement method, to determine regions where refinement should be done. The other is the modification of the multiresolution method of Harten [5] by converting it to a new, redundant, non-orthogonal wavelet. The wavelet sensor is then obtained by computing the estimated Lipschitz exponent of a chosen physical quantity (or vector) to be sensed on a chosen wavelet basis function. Both wavelet sensors can be viewed as dual purpose adaptive methods leading to dynamic numerical dissipation control and improved grid adaptation indicators. Consequently, they are useful not only for shock-turbulence computations but also for computational aeroacoustics and numerical combustion. In addition, these sensors are scheme independent and can be stand-alone options for numerical algorithms other than the Yee et al. scheme.",B. Sjögreen1 & H. C.

699,Application of a spectral method to numerical modeling of the propagation of seismic waves in porous media with energy dissipation,"This paper presents an algorithm based on the spectral Laguerre method for approximation of time derivatives as applied to a problem of seismic wave propagation in porous media with energy dissipation. The initial system of equations is written as a first-order hyperbolic system in terms of velocities, stresses, and pore pressure. To numerically solve the problem, a combination of an analytical Laguerre transform and a finite-difference method is used. The method proposed in the paper is an analog of a well-known spectral method based on the Fourier transform. However, unlike the Fourier transform, the integral Laguerre transform with respect to time reduces the initial problem to a system of equations in which the expansion parameter is present only in the right-hand side of the equations as a recurrence relation. As compared to the finite-difference method, with an analytical transform in the spectral method it is possible to reduce the original problem to a system of differential equations having only derivatives with respect to the spatial coordinates. This allows using the known stable difference scheme for the recurrence solutions to similar systems. Such an approach is effective when solving dynamic problems for porous media. Because of the presence of a second longitudinal wave with low velocity, the use of difference schemes in all the coordinates to obtain stable solutions requires a small step consistent both with respect to time and space, which inevitably increases the execution time.",Kh.

The problem is assumed to be axially symmetric and periodic along the cylinders. The construction is based on finite-difference approximations in time and bilinear finite-element approximations in a cylindrical coordinate system.

702,A hybrid numerical-asymptotic boundary integral method for high-frequency acoustic scattering,"We propose a new robust method for the computation of scattering of high-frequency acoustic plane waves by smooth convex objects in 2D. We formulate this problem by the direct boundary integral method, using the classical combined potential approach. By exploiting the known asymptotics of the solution, we devise particular expansions, valid in various zones of the boundary, which express the solution of the integral equation as a product of explicit oscillatory functions and more slowly varying unknown amplitudes. The amplitudes are approximated by polynomials (of minimum degree d) in each zone using a Galerkin scheme. We prove that the underlying bilinear form is continuous in L
2, with a continuity constant that grows mildly in the wavenumber k. We also show that the bilinear form is uniformly L
2-coercive, independent of k, for all k sufficiently large. (The latter result depends on rather delicate Fourier analysis and is restricted in 2D to circular domains, but it also applies to spheres in higher dimensions.) Using these results and the asymptotic expansion of the solution, we prove superalgebraic convergence of our numerical method as d → ∞ for fixed k. We also prove that, as k → ∞, d has to increase only very modestly to maintain a fixed error bound (d ∼ k
1/9 is a typical behaviour). Numerical experiments show that the method suffers minimal loss of accuracy as k →∞, for a fixed number of degrees of freedom. Numerical solutions with a relative error of about 10−5 are obtained on domains of size \(\mathcal{O}(1)\) for k up to 800 using about 60 degrees of freedom.","V. Domínguez1, I. G. Graham2 & V. P.

703,Impact of Force Function Formulations on the Numerical Simulation of Centre-Based Models,"Centre-based or cell-centre models are a framework for the computational study of multicellular systems with widespread use in cancer modelling and computational developmental biology. At the core of these models are the numerical method used to update cell positions and the force functions that encode the pairwise mechanical interactions of cells. For the latter, there are multiple choices that could potentially affect both the biological behaviour captured, and the robustness and efficiency of simulation. For example, available open-source software implementations of centre-based models rely on different force functions for their default behaviour and it is not straightforward for a modeller to know if these are interchangeable. Our study addresses this problem and contributes to the understanding of the potential and limitations of three popular force functions from a numerical perspective. We show empirically that choosing the force parameters such that the relaxation time for two cells after cell division is consistent between different force functions results in good agreement of the population radius of a two-dimensional monolayer relaxing mechanically after intense cell proliferation. Furthermore, we report that numerical stability is not sufficient to prevent unphysical cell trajectories following cell division, and consequently, that too large time steps can cause geometrical differences at the population level.

Numerical solutions have been obtained for problems of wave propagation in such highly heterogeneous media, including those taking into account the plastic properties of the rock that can be manifested in the vicinity of a seismic gap or a well bore. All kinds of elastic and elastoplastic waves are analyzed resulting from the propagation of the initial disturbance and the waves arising from the reflection from the cracks and from the boundaries of the integration domain. An investigation was carried out of wave identification by means of seismograms obtained at the receiver located near the ground surface. In this study, the grid-characteristic method is employed using computational grids with triangular meshes and boundary conditions formulated at the interface between the rock and the crack, and on free surfaces in an explicit form. The proposed numerical method is extremely general and is suitable for investigations of the processes of seismic waves’ interaction with heterogeneous inclusions because it ensures the construction of the most correct computational algorithms at the boundaries of the integration domain and at the medium’s interface.","I.

706,A Second Order Accurate Scalar Auxiliary Variable (SAV) Numerical Method for the Square Phase Field Crystal Equation,"In this paper we propose and analyze a second order accurate (in time) numerical scheme for the square phase field crystal equation, a gradient flow modeling crystal dynamics at the atomic scale in space but on diffusive scales in time. Its primary difference with the standard phase field crystal model is an introduction of the 4-Laplacian term in the free energy potential, which in turn leads to a much higher degree of nonlinearity. To make the numerical scheme linear while preserving the nonlinear energy stability, we make use of the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach, in which a second order backward differentiation formula is applied in the temporal stencil. Meanwhile, a direct application of the SAV method faces certain difficulties, due to the involvement of the 4-Laplacian term, combined with a derivation of the lower bound of the nonlinear energy functional. In the proposed numerical method, an appropriate decomposition for the physical energy functional is formulated, so that the nonlinear energy part has a well-established global lower bound, and the rest terms lead to constant-coefficient diffusion terms with positive eigenvalues. In turn, the numerical scheme could be very efficiently implemented by constant-coefficient Poisson-like type solvers (via FFT), and energy stability is established by introducing an auxiliary variable, and an optimal rate convergence analysis is provided for the proposed SAV method. A few numerical experiments are also presented, which confirm the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme.","Min Wang1, Qiumei Huang

The function is assumed to satisfy appropriate asymptotic conditions including, in particular, that required by Carlson’s theorem. The peculiar features of the present procedure are: (a) it does not make use of the approximation of meromorphic functions by rational functions; (b) it does not use the standard methods of regularization of ill-posed problems. The data required for the determination of the pole parameters (i.e., location and residue) are the approximate values of the meromorphic function on a finite set of equidistant points on the real positive semi-axis. We show that this method is numerically stable by proving that the algorithm is convergent as the number of data points tends to infinity and the noise on the input data goes to zero. Moreover, we can also evaluate the degree of approximation of the estimates of pole location and residue which we obtain from the knowledge of a finite number of noisy samples.",Enrico De Micheli1 & Giovanni A.

708,Spatio-temporal pattern formation on spherical surfaces: numerical simulation and application to solid tumour growth," In this paper we examine spatio-temporal pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems on the surface of the unit sphere in 3D. We first generalise the usual linear stability analysis for a two-chemical system to this geometrical context. Noting the limitations of this approach (in terms of rigorous prediction of spatially heterogeneous steady-states) leads us to develop, as an alternative, a novel numerical method which can be applied to systems of any dimension with any reaction kinetics. This numerical method is based on the method of lines with spherical harmonics and uses fast Fourier transforms to expedite the computation of the reaction kinetics. Numerical experiments show that this method efficiently computes the evolution of spatial patterns and yields numerical results which coincide with those predicted by linear stability analysis when the latter is known. Using these tools, we then investigate the rôle that pre-pattern (Turing) theory may play in the growth and development of solid tumours. The theoretical steady-state distributions of two chemicals (one a growth activating factor, the other a growth inhibitory factor) are compared with the experimentally and clinically observed spatial heterogeneity of cancer cells in small, solid spherical tumours such as multicell spheroids and carcinomas. Moreover, we suggest a number of chemicals which are known to be produced by tumour cells (autocrine growth factors), and are also known to interact with one another, as possible growth promoting and growth inhibiting factors respectively. In order to connect more concretely the numerical method to this application, we compute spatially heterogeneous patterns on the surface of a growing spherical tumour, modelled as a moving-boundary problem. The numerical results strongly support the theoretical expectations in this case. Finally in an appendix we give a brief analysis of the numerical method.","M.A.J. Chaplain1, M. Ganesh2 & I.G.

710,The Use of Full-Wave Numerical Simulation for the Investigation of Fractured Zones,"AbstractIn this paper, we describe the stages and results of investigating the features of oil-saturated fractured zones through the analysis of the spatial dynamic wave patterns obtained by supercomputer-aided modeling with the grid-characteristic method. Full-wave modeling is employed in geophysics to construct synthetic seismograms and to solve inverse problems. In this paper, we demonstrate that the analysis of spatial dynamic wave patterns allows us to make conclusions that can later be useful in geophysical surveys. Compared to methods for analysis and interpretation of seismograms, the proposed approach to wave pattern analysis facilitates the investigation of the dynamics of waves of different types, while also being more accurate than the ray-tracing method and geometric approximation. Three types of fractured clusters—solid, intermittent, and chess—are considered. As a result of the investigation, some characteristic regularities are discovered, e.g., the dependence of the seismic wave scattering angle on the source frequency and the geometric arrangement of the fractures in the cluster, and the source frequency dependence of the trajectory and velocity of the point at which the longitudinal head wave separates from the S-wave. These regularities can subsequently be adapted to optimize the seismic prospecting of hydrocarbons and the investigation of fractured zones, e.g., to select the optimal equipment and method for seismic survey. In addition, we discuss the importance of analyzing the spatial dynamic wave patterns when designing and testing numerical methods, as well as interface and boundary conditions, including the absorbing ones. Moreover, we propose an approach to construct a nonlinear scale that enables the simultaneous analysis of the spatial dynamic wave processes whose amplitudes differ by more than two orders of magnitude.","A.

712,Mathematical study of two-variable systems with adaptive numerical methods,"In this paper, we consider reaction–diffusion systems arising from two-component predator–prey models with Smith growth functional response. The mathematical approach used here is in two folds since the time-dependent partial differential equations consist of both linear and nonlinear terms. We discretize the stiff or moderately stiff term with the fourth-order difference operator and advance the resulting nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations with the two competing families of the exponential time differencing (ETD) schemes, and we analyze them for stability. Numerical comparison between these two methods for solving various predator–prey population models with functional responses are also presented. Numerical results show that the techniques require less computational work. Also in the numerical results, some emerging spatial patterns are unveiled.","K. M.

713,A fourth-order numerical method for the planetary geostrophic equations with inviscid geostrophic balance,"The planetary geostrophic equations with inviscid balance equation are reformulated in an alternate form, and a fourth-order finite difference numerical method of solution is proposed and analyzed in this article. In the reformulation, there is only one prognostic equation for the temperature field and the velocity field is statically determined by the planetary geostrophic balance combined with the incompressibility condition. The key observation is that all the velocity profiles can be explicitly determined by the temperature gradient, by utilizing the special form of the Coriolis parameter. This brings convenience and efficiency in the numerical study. In the fourth-order scheme, the temperature is dynamically updated at the regular numerical grid by long-stencil approximation, along with a one-sided extrapolation near the boundary. The velocity variables are recovered by special solvers on the 3-D staggered grid. Furthermore, it is shown that the numerical velocity field is divergence-free at the discrete level in a suitable sense. Fourth order convergence is proven under mild regularity requirements.","Roger Samelson1, Roger Temam2, Cheng Wang3 & …Shouhong Wang",Numerische Mathematik,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-007-0104-z,"35Q35,65M06,65M12,86A10"

717,An integral equation–based numerical method for the forced heat equation on complex domains,"Integral equation–based numerical methods are directly applicable to homogeneous elliptic PDEs and offer the ability to solve these with high accuracy and speed on complex domains. In this paper, such a method is extended to the heat equation with inhomogeneous source terms. First, the heat equation is discretised in time, then in each time step we solve a sequence of so-called modified Helmholtz equations with a parameter depending on the time step size. The modified Helmholtz equation is then split into two: a homogeneous part solved with a boundary integral method and a particular part, where the solution is obtained by evaluating a volume potential over the inhomogeneous source term over a simple domain. In this work, we introduce two components which are critical for the success of this approach: a method to efficiently compute a high-regularity extension of a function outside the domain where it is defined, and a special quadrature method to accurately evaluate singular and nearly singular integrals in the integral formulation of the modified Helmholtz equation for all time step sizes.","Fredrik Fryklund

Then, through customization of the commercial finite element software ABAQUS/Standard, the damage state is directly assigned to the integration points of elements, thereby avoiding modification of the finite element model. Afterwards, the damaged structures by ABAQUS/Standard is conducted numerically.

In a typical application scenario, we need to repeatedly sample the solution to a system of linear non-autonomous ordinary differential equations for different values of one or more parameters as we detect and locate the zeros of the Evans function in the right half of the complex plane.In this situation, a substantial portion of the computational effort—the numerical evaluation of the iterated integrals which appear in the Magnus series—can be performed independent of the parameters and hence needs to be done only once. More importantly, for any given tolerance Magnus integrators possess lower bounds on the step size which are uniform across large regions of parameter space and which can be estimated a priori. We demonstrate, analytically as well as through numerical experiment, that these features render Magnus integrators extremely robust and, depending on the regime of interest, efficient in comparison with standard ODE solvers.

Examples are Hamiltonian systems with quadratic potential energy. In such systems, homoclinic orbits that are invariant under the reversible transformation are typically not destroyed as a parameter is varied. A strategy is proposed for the direct numerical approximation to paths of such homoclinic orbits, exploiting the special properties of reversible systems. This strategy incorporates continuation using a simplification of known methods and a shooting approach, based on Newton's method, to compute starting solutions for continuation. For Hamiltonian systems, the shooting uses symplectic numerical integration. Strategies are discussed for obtaining initial guesses for the unknown parameters in Newton's method. An example system, for which there is an infinity of symmetric homoclinic orbits, is used to test the numerical techniques. It is illustrated how the orbits can be systematically located and followed. Excellent agreement is found between theory and numerics.",Alan R.

722,"Accuracy and conservation properties in numerical integration: the case of the Korteweg-de Vries equation
","When numerically integrating time-dependent differential equations, it is often recommended to employ methods that preserve some of the invariant quantities (mass, energy, etc.) of the problem being considered. This recommendation is usually justified on the grounds that conservation of invariant quantities may ensure that the numerical solution possesses some important qualitative features. However there are cases where schemes that preserve invariants are also advantageous in that they possess favourable error propagation mechanisms that render them superior from a quantitative point of view. In the present paper we consider the Korteweg-de Vries equation as a case study. We show rigorously that, for soliton problems and at leading order, the error of conservative schemes consists of a phase error that grows linearly with time plus a complementary term that is bounded in the \(H^1\) norm uniformly in time.  For ‘general’, nonconservative schemes the error involves a linearly growing amplitude error, a quadratically growing phase error and a complementary term that grows linearly in the \(H^1\) norm. Numerical experiments are presented.

The resulting RKDG methods are stable, high-order accurate, and highly parallelizable schemes that can easily handle complicated geometries and boundary conditions.

We select the ideal MHD equations as they are particularly useful for mathematically modeling a wide variety of magnetized fluids. In order to be self-contained we first motivate the physical properties of a magnetic fluid and how it should behave under the laws of thermodynamics. Next, we introduce a mathematical model built from hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) that translate physical laws into mathematical equations. After an overview of the continuous analysis, we thoroughly describe the derivation of a numerical approximation of the ideal MHD system that remains consistent to the continuous thermodynamic principles. The derivation of the method and the theorems contained within serve as the bulk of the review article. We demonstrate that the derived numerical approximation retains the correct entropic properties of the continuous model and show its applicability to a variety of standard numerical test cases for MHD schemes.

743,Numerical approximations of the mean absorption cross-section of a variety of randomly oriented microalgal shapes,"The size, shape, and absorption coefficient of a microalgal cell determines, to a first order approximation, the rate at which light is absorbed by the cell. The rate of absorption determines the maximum amount of energy available for photosynthesis, and can be used to calculate the attenuation of light through the water column, including the effect of packaging pigments within discrete particles. In this paper, numerical approximations are made of the mean absorption cross-section of randomly oriented cells, \({{\overline{{aA}}}}\). The shapes investigated are spheroids, rectangular prisms with a square base, cylinders, cones and double cones with aspect ratios of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4. The results of the numerical simulations are fitted to a modified sigmoid curve, and take advantage of three analytical solutions. The results are presented in a non-dimensionalised format and are independent of size. A simple approximation using a rectangular hyperbolic curve is also given, and an approach for obtaining the upper and lower bounds of \({{\overline{{aA}}}}\) for more complex shapes is outlined.",Mark E.

The damping is supported in a subset of the domain, so that the solutions of the continuous model issuing from small data are globally defined and exponentially decreasing in the energy space. Based in this asymptotic behavior of the solution, we introduce a finite difference scheme, which despite being one of the first order, has the good property to converge in L
4-strong. Combining this strong convergence with discrete multipliers and a contradiction argument, we show that the smallness of the initial condition leads to the uniform (with respect to the mesh size) exponential decay of the energy associated to the scheme. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the performance of the method and to confirm the theoretical results.","A. F. Pazoto1,2, M. Sepúlveda3 & O.

The information is obtained from measurements at the boundary of the solution domain. The purpose of our paper is to construct a numerical algorithm for solving the inverse problem by an iterative method called a method of simple iteration (MSI) and to study the resolution quality of the inverse problem as a function of the number and location of measurement points. Three two-dimensional inverse problem formulations are considered. The results of our numerical calculations are presented. It is shown that the MSI decreases the objective functional at each iteration step. However, due to the ill-posedness of the inverse problem the difference between the exact and approximate solutions decreases up to some fixed number k
min, and then monotonically increases. This shows the regularizing properties of the MSI, and the iteration number can be considered a regularization parameter.","S. I. Kabanikhin1,2, O. I.

22, 987–1011], we had performed numerical comparisons for different time stepping schemes for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. In this paper, we present the numerical analysis in the context of the Navier–Stokes equations for a modified time-stepping θ-scheme which has been recently proposed by Glowinski [Glowinski (2003). In: Ciarlet, P. G., and Lions, J. L. (eds.), Handbook of Numerical Analysis, Vol. IX, North-Holland, Amsterdam, pp. 3–1176]. Like the well-known classical Fractional-Step-θ-scheme which had been introduced by Glowinski [Glowinski (1985). In Murman, E. M. and Abarbanel, S. S. (eds.), Progress and Supercomputing in Computational Fluid Dynamics, Birkhäuser, Boston MA; Bristeau et al. (1987). Comput. Phys. Rep. 6, 73–187], too, and which is still one of the most popular time stepping schemes, with or without operator splitting techniques, this new scheme consists of 3 substeps with nonequidistant substepping to build one macro time step. However, in contrast to the Fractional-Step-θ-scheme, the second substep can be formulated as an extrapolation step for previously computed data only, and the two remaining substeps look like a Backward Euler step so that no expensive operator evaluations for the right hand side vector with older solutions, as for instance in the Crank–Nicolson scheme, have to be performed. This modified scheme is implicit, strongly A-stable and second order accurate, too, which promises some advantageous behavior, particularly in implicit CFD simulations for the nonstationary Navier–Stokes equations. Representative numerical results, based on the software package FEATFLOW [Turek (2000). FEATFLOW Finite element software for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations: User Manual, Release 1.2, University of Dortmund] are obtained for typical flow problems with benchmark character which provide a fair rating of the solution schemes, particularly in long time simulations.","Stefan Turek1, Ludmila Rivkind1, Jaroslav Hron1 & …Roland Glowinski",Journal of Scientific Computing,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-006-9083-y,"Implicit time stepping,Fractional-Step-θ-schemes,incompressible Navier–Stokes equations,nonstationary computational fluid dynamics"

In order to investigate this functional relationship using the methods of mathematical analysis a structural model of the numerical algorithm calledR-automaton is introduced. It is shown that the functional dependence defined by anR-automaton is a continuous rational function in a neighborhood of any data point except in a point set, the Lebesgue measure of which is zero.

In this paper we consider two types of concentration problems for the signals which are bandlimited in disjoint frequency-intervals, which constitute a band-pass filter. For the first type the problem is to determine which members of L
2(−∞,∞) lose the smallest fraction of their energy when first timelimited and then bandlimited. For the second type the problem is to determine which bandlimited signals lose the smallest fraction of their energy when restricted to a given time interval. For both types of problems, basic theoretical properties and numerical algorithms for solution and convergence theorems are given. Orthogonality properties of analytically extended eigenfunctions over L
2(−∞,∞) are also proved. Numerical computations are carried out which corroborate the theory. Relationship between eigenvalues of these two types of problems is also established. Several properties of eigenvalues of both types of problems are proved.","Indranil SenGupta1, Bo Sun2, Weisheng Jiang3, Goong Chen4 & …Maria C.

778,Numerical simulation of an elastoplastic plate via mixed finite elements,"A mixed interpolated formulation for the analysis of elastoplastic Reissner-Mindlin plates is presented. Special attention is given to the limit case of very small thickness that is well known to lead to inaccurate numerical solutions, unless ad-hoc remedies are taken into account to avoid locking (such as reduced or selective integration schemes). The finite element presented herein combines the higher-order approach with the mixed-interpolated formulation of linear elastic problems. This mixed element has been herein extended to the elasto-plastic behavior, using a J
2 approach with yield function depending on moments and shear stresses. A backward-Euler procedure is then used to map the elastic trial stresses back to the yield surface with the aid of a Newton-Raphson approach to solve the nonlinear system and without the calculation of the consistent tangent matrix. The element is shown to be very effective for the class of benchmark problems analyzed and does not present any locking or instability tendencies, as illustrated by various representative examples.","Lucia Della Croce1, Paolo Venini2 & Roberto Nascimbene",Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1022836202029,"elasto-plastic analysis,mixed finite element,Reissner-Mindlin plate"

A method is proposed to find stresses based on nonlinear “stress-strain” dependencies. When numerically determining stiffness properties of a cross-section, a nonlinear analysis of a given collection of forces was performed. Using the method for performing nonlinear analysis, which is implemented in the software package “LIRA-SAPR,” the tangent and secant stiffness properties are determined. The methods proposed for determining and modeling stiffness properties allow to more precisely specify characteristics of nonlinear strain in materials and to apply them to elements of the cross-sections being designed.","O.

A numerical method is presented consisting of a finite difference scheme to be solved over a Shishkin mesh.

786,Linear Instability of Electromagnetic Viscoelastic Nanofluid: Analytical and Numerical Study,"In this study, the effect of the induced electromagnetic fields on the linear instability of a viscoelastic nanofluid liquid layer is discussed. Two physical cases are considered for the channel flow. The first one is considered for the free–free boundaries and the second for the rigid–rigid boundaries. The instability is investigated analytically due to the normal mode analysis and numerically according to the relation between the energy density function and time. The Routh–Hurwitz criteria are applied. The dispersion relation is obtained as a sixth-degree equation of the growth rate. Also, the stationary, as well as oscillatory states of the thermal Rayleigh number, are obtained. The numerical solution is compared with the exact solution for a special choice of the parameters and the results show higher match between the results. The main important result of the study concludes that the Brownian motion of the nanoparticles destabilizes the nanofluid layer. This means that the pure fluid layer is more stable than the nanofluid layer. Also, the results confirm that the flow between the rigid–rigid boundaries is more stable than the free–free boundaries. Finally, due to the Lorentz force, the induced magnetic field destabilizes the motion due to the temperature rise.","Mohamed A. Hassan

787,Numerical Approaches for Investigating Quasiconvexity in the Context of Morrey’s Conjecture,"Deciding whether a given function is quasiconvex is generally a difficult task. Here, we discuss a number of numerical approaches that can be used in the search for a counterexample to the quasiconvexity of a given function W. We will demonstrate these methods using the planar isotropic rank-one convex function $$\begin{aligned} W_\textrm{magic}^+(F)=\frac{\lambda _\textrm{max}}{\lambda _\textrm{min}}-\log \frac{\lambda _\textrm{max}}{\lambda _\textrm{min}}+\log \det F=\frac{\lambda _\textrm{max}}{\lambda _\textrm{min}}+2\log \lambda _\textrm{min}\,, \end{aligned}$$where \(\lambda _\textrm{max}\ge \lambda _\textrm{min}\) are the singular values of F, as our main example. In a previous contribution, we have shown that quasiconvexity of this function would imply quasiconvexity for all rank-one convex isotropic planar energies \(W:{\text {GL}}^+(2)\rightarrow {\mathbb {R}}\) with an additive volumetric-isochoric split of the form $$\begin{aligned} W(F)=W_\textrm{iso}(F)+W_\textrm{vol}(\det F)={\widetilde{W}}_\textrm{iso}\bigg (\frac{F}{\sqrt{\det F}}\bigg )+W_\textrm{vol}(\det F) \end{aligned}$$with a concave volumetric part. This example is therefore of particular interest with regard to Morrey’s open question whether or not rank-one convexity implies quasiconvexity in the planar case.","Jendrik Voss

790,A family of numerical schemes for kinematic flows with discontinuous flux,"Multiphase flows of suspensions and emulsions are frequently approximated by spatially one-dimensional kinematic models, in which the velocity of each species of the disperse phase is an explicitly given function of the vector of concentrations of all species. The continuity equations for all species then form a system of conservation laws which describes spatial segregation and the creation of areas of different composition. This class of models also includes multi-class traffic flow, where vehicles belong to different classes according to their preferential velocities. Recently, these models were extended to fluxes that depend discontinuously on the spatial coordinate, which appear in clarifier–thickener models, in duct flows with abruptly varying cross-sectional area, and in traffic flow with variable road surface conditions. This paper presents a new family of numerical schemes for such kinematic flows with a discontinuous flux. It is shown how a very simple scheme for the scalar case, which is adapted to the “concentration times velocity” structure of the flux, can be extended to kinematic models with phase velocities that change sign, flows with two or more species (the system case), and discontinuous fluxes. In addition, a MUSCL-type upgrade in combination with a Runge–Kutta-type time discretization can be devised to attain second-order accuracy. It is proved that two particular schemes within the family, which apply to systems of conservation laws, preserve an invariant region of admissible concentration vectors, provided that all velocities have the same sign. Moreover, for the relevant case of a multiplicative flux discontinuity and a constant maximum density, it is proved that one scalar version converges to a BV

t
 entropy solution of the model. In the latter case, the compactness proof involves a novel uniform but local estimate of the spatial total variation of the approximate solutions. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of all variants within the new family of schemes, including applications to problems of sedimentation, traffic flow, and the settling of oil-in-water emulsions.","R.

791,Numerical Simulation of Influence of Surface Features on the Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication of Sliding Line Contact Using Krylov Subspace Method,"The article presents an efficient novel numerical method to investigate overrolling (with slip) of transient EHL line contact problem with surface asperities. Jacobian free Newton–Krylov subspace (JFNK) method is used for the solution of discretized transient Reynolds and film thickness equations. The dense nonsymmetric large system of linear equations is solved using an iterative strategy based on wavelet based preconditioned generalized minimal residual (GMRES) algorithm incorporating a line search scheme to archive global convergence. The focus is on highly loaded (with Hertz pressure 2GPa) line contact EHL problem to obtain pressure and film profiles as functions of the slide to roll ratio. The nonsynchronization of pressure and film profiles (especially at dent locations) is found explicitly which is more pronounced as the dent approaches the contact central region and moves towards the exit. Leading/trailing of film profile is observed as the dent (attached with an upper surface) moves slower/faster compared with average speed (of surfaces). Also, there is an increase (in height as well as a spread) of Petrusevich pressure spike as dent moves through the contact region towards the exit. For the waviness attached with the upper surface, the pressure and film profiles are obtained again as functions of a slide to roll ratio. Pressure profiles are invariant with respect to this parameter whereas film profiles are entirely different in all these cases. The proposed method, with projection features, captures salient aspects of the model problem with much lesser degrees of freedom compared with conventional schemes.",N. M. Bujurke1 & M. H.

The results suggest that the nonlinear characteristics of the motions of atmosphere and oceans can be explored by NSV and CNOP. Also attentions are paid to the introduction of the classification of predictability problems, which are related to the maximum predictable time, the maximum prediction error, and the maximum allowing error of initial value and the parameters. All the information has the background of application to the evaluation of products of numerical weather and climate prediction. Furthermore the nonlinear optimization methods of the sensitivity analysis with numerical model are also introduced, which can give a quantitative assessment whether a numerical model is able to simulate the observations and find the initial field that yield the optimal simulation.

Specifically, a one-dimensional nonlinear heat equation is described which governs the temperature in the outer region. This is a numerically well posed problem and it is efficiently solved using standard methods. This solution is not valid in the inner region which includes the microwave source. An inner asymptotic approximation is derived to describe the temperature in this region. This approximation yields two unknown functions which are determined from matching to the outer solution. The results of the asymptotic theory are compared to calculations done on the full problem.

This procedure involves the computation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) z(s) of a set of polynomials T derived from P, and the factorisation of the product of the original set P, p(s) as p(s) = m(s)·z(s). The symbolic procedure leads to a numerical one, where robust methods for the computation of GCD are first used. In this numerical method the approximate factorisation of polynomials is an important part of the overall algorithm. The latter problem is handled by studying two associated problems: evaluation of order of approximation and the optimal completion problem.

This technique allows considering the subsoil-structure contact interaction, gravity field effects, the inhomogeneous structure of soil and the varieties location of the earthquake hypocenter. As part of this technique is substantiated sizing of the soil-structure computational domain and continuum model for hard and soft soil foundations describing. The numerical technique for determining the kinematic conditions at the lower boundary of the computational domain from the experimental accelerations at the soil surface is given, offered special non-reflecting waves boundary conditions. The methods described above and algorithms for seismic resistance solving have been implemented in certified software package “Dynamica-3”, parallelization of the algorithm has been held according to the spatial domain decomposition principle. The developed numerical technique allows correctly posing the problem of seismic vibrations of buried structure, reducing computing costs and increasing the efficiency of numerical studies of Earthquake Engineering. Through this, the multiple recalculation of the task with different action scenarios generated from experimental seismograms by probabilistic methods became technically possible. The results of these calculations allow reflecting the experience of many earthquakes, which increases reliability of the estimates. The paper presents the model calculations results of seismic stability of large-sized buried structure—the mutual vertical and horizontal displacement of soil and building walls—which can then be used to assess strength of adjacent underground pipelines.

As additional conditions, a non-local integral condition for the solution of the equation and condition of final overdetermination are given. This problem belongs to the class of combined inverse problems. By integrating the equation with the use of additional integral condition, the problem is transformed to a coefficient inverse problem with local conditions. The derivative with respect to the spatial variable is discretized and a special representation is proposed to solve the resultant semi-discrete problem. As a result, for each discrete value of the spatial variable, the semi-discrete problem splits into two parts: a Cauchy problem and a linear equation with respect to the approximate value of the unknown kinetic coefficient. To determine the source function, an explicit formula is also obtained. The numerical solution of the Cauchy problem uses the implicit Euler method. Numerical experiments are carried out on the basis of the proposed method.","Kh. M. Gamzaev1, S. O. Huseynzade1 & G. G.

The speed of changes in the size of the components of such systems usually lies in a wide range, as the dynamics and behavior of the vehicles can strongly differ. In this paper we introduce a multirate numerical scheme with a self-adjusting time stepping strategy. Instead of using a single step size for the whole system, the step size for each component is determined by estimating its own local variation. The stability analysis for the developed scheme is performed and the stability conditions are obtained. The presented multirate scheme provides a significant speed-up in the CPU times compared to the corresponding single-rate one. The use of multiple time steps allows parallel computing.",V. V.

817,Avoiding numerical cancellation in the interior point method for solving semidefinite programs," The matrix variables in a primal-dual pair of semidefinite programs are getting increasingly ill-conditioned as they approach a complementary solution. Multiplying the primal matrix variable with a vector from the eigenspace of the non-basic part will therefore result in heavy numerical cancellation. This effect is amplified by the scaling operation in interior point methods. A complete example illustrates these numerical issues. In order to avoid numerical problems in interior point methods, we propose to maintain the matrix variables in a Cholesky form. We discuss how the factors of the v-space Cholesky form can be updated after a main iteration of the interior point method with Nesterov-Todd scaling.

In Part I of this paper (He et al. in Proximal-like contraction methods for monotone variational inequalities in a unified framework I: effective quadruplet and primary methods, 2010), we proposed a unified framework consisting of an effective quadruplet and a corresponding accepting rule. Under the framework, various existing APPAs can be grouped in the same class of methods (called primary or elementary methods) which adopt one of the geminate directions in the effective quadruplet and take the unit step size. In this paper, we extend the primary methods by using the same effective quadruplet and the accepting rule. The extended (general) contraction methods need only minor extra even negligible costs in each iteration, whereas having better properties than the primary methods in sense of the distance to the solution set. A set of matrix approximation examples as well as six other groups of numerical experiments are constructed to compare the performance between the primary (elementary) and extended (general) methods.

As well known, within a similarity analysis we can define a family of solutions from a computed one, so that the solution of a target problem can be obtained by rescaling the solution of a reference problem. The main idea is to use scaling invariance and numerical analysis to find a reference problem easier to solve, from a numerical viewpoint, than the target problem. This allows us to save human efforts and computational resources every time we have to solve a challenging problem.We test our approach using three stiff solvers available within the most recent releases of MATLAB.

The activation and the deactivation of inequality constraints induce discontinuity points in the time evolution. A numerical method based on an operator splitting scheme and a fixed point algorithm is advocated. The ordinary differential equations are approximated by the Crank-Nicolson scheme, while a primal-dual interior-point method with warm-starts is used to solve the minimization problem. The computation of the discontinuity points is based on geometric arguments, extrapolation polynomials and sensitivity analysis. Second order convergence of the method is proved when an inequality constraint is activated. Numerical results for atmospheric particles confirm the theoretical investigations.","A. Caboussat1, C.

Seismic wave propagation in an elastic half-space is described by a system of first-order dynamic equations of elasticity theory. The propagation of acoustic-gravitational waves in the atmosphere in the presence of wind is described by the linearized Navier-Stokes equations.

The hypothesis that optimum convergence is achieved when the real and imaginary parts for the lowest harmonic in a Fourier solution cancel appears to be upheld. The Fourier solution for the problem has been advanced by a better understanding of the nature of the initial excitation. The relationship between the form of the initial condition used in this and many other numerical solutions of the Laplace equation and oscillatory behavior in the results is given a firmer theoretical basis.

The geometry of the computational domain is based on microtomographic scanning of bioprostheses. To set a variable pressure gradient causing an unsteady flow in the prostheses, personal-specific data of the Doppler echography of the blood flow of a particular patient are used. A comparative analysis of the velocity fields in the flow areas corresponding to three real samples of bioprostheses with multiple stenoses is carried out. In the zones of stenosis and outside of them, the distribution of the near-wall shear stress, which affects the risk factors for thrombosis in the prostheses, is analyzed.

851,Using Computer Algebra to Certify the Global Convergence of a Numerical Optimization Process,"The basic objective of blind signal separation is to recover a set of source signals from a set of observations that are mixtures of the sources with no, or very limited knowledge about the mixture structure and source signals. To extract the original sources, many algorithms have been proposed; among them, the cross-correlation and constant modulus algorithm (CC-CMA) appears to be the algorithm of choice due to its computational simplicity.An important issue in CC-CMA algorithm is the global convergence analysis, because the cost function is not quadratic nor convex and contains undesirable stationary points. If these undesirable points are local minimums, the convergence of the algorithm may not be guaranteed and the CC-CMA would fail to separate source signals.The main result of this paper is to complete the classification of these stationary points and to prove that they are not local minimums unless if the mixing parameter is equal to 1.This is obtained by using the theory of discriminant varieties to determine the stationnary points as a function of the parameter and then to show that the Hessian matrix of the cost function is not positive semidefinite at these stationnay points, unless if the mixing parameter is 1.","Nong Gu1, Daniel Lazard2, Fabrice Rouillier2 & …Yong Xiang",Mathematics in Computer Science,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11786-007-0021-7,"Primary 94A12,secondary 13P10, 14P10, 65K99"
852,Reduction in the Resonance Error in Numerical Homogenization II: Correctors and Extrapolation,"This paper is the follow-up of Gloria (Math Models Methods Appl Sci 21(8):1601–1630, 2011). One common drawback among numerical homogenization methods is the presence of the so-called resonance error, which roughly speaking is a function of the ratio \(\frac{\varepsilon }{\rho }\), where \(\rho \) is a typical macroscopic lengthscale and \(\varepsilon \) is the typical size of the heterogeneities. In the present work, we make a systematic use of regularization and extrapolation to reduce this resonance error at the level of the approximation of homogenized coefficients and correctors for general non-necessarily symmetric stationary ergodic coefficients. We quantify this reduction for the class of periodic coefficients, for the Kozlov subclass of almost-periodic coefficients, and for the subclass of random coefficients that satisfy a spectral gap estimate (e.g., Poisson random inclusions). We also report on a systematic numerical study in dimension 2, which demonstrates the efficiency of the method and the sharpness of the analysis. Last, we combine this approach to numerical homogenization methods, prove the asymptotic consistency in the case of locally stationary ergodic coefficients, and give quantitative estimates in the case of periodic coefficients.","Antoine Gloria1,2 & Zakaria Habibi",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-015-9246-z,"Numerical homogenization,Resonance error,Effective coefficients,Correctors,Periodic,Almost periodic,Random"
853,Analytical-Numerical Approach to Describing Time-Periodic Motion of Fronts in Singularly Perturbed Reaction–Advection–Diffusion Models,"AbstractThe paper presents an analytical-numerical approach to the study of moving fronts in singularly perturbed reaction–diffusion–advection models. A method for generating a dynamically adapted grid for the efficient numerical solution of problems of this class is proposed. The method is based on a priori information about the motion and properties of the front, obtained by rigorous asymptotic analysis of a singularly perturbed parabolic problem. In particular, the essential parameters taken into account when constructing the grid are estimates of the position of the transition layer, as well as its width and structure. The proposed analytical-numerical approach can significantly save computer resources, reduce the computation time, and increase the stability of the computational process in comparison with the classical approaches. An example demonstrating the main ideas and methods of application of the proposed approach is considered.","V. T. Volkov1, D. V. Lukyanenko1 & N. N.

Since no finite-difference approximations are used, no grid dispersion occurs in computing wave fields for arbitrary media models and observation points. An analytical solution representation in the spectral domain makes it possible to analyze the wave field by parts, specifically, to obtain primary waves. A program of computing the wave fields has been developed, and a simulation of water waves and seismic “ringing” of the Moon has been carried out. The phenomenon of a monotonic shift of the resonance to the lower frequency area with increasing distance of recording is explained. This phenomenon was detected in some experiments with a seismic vibrator.",B. G. Mikhailenko1 & A. G.

860,Numerical shape optimization to decrease failure probability of ceramic structures,"Ceramic is a material frequently used in industry because of its favorable properties. Common approaches in shape optimization for ceramic structures aim to minimize the tensile stress acting on the component, as it is the main driver for failure. In contrast to this, we follow a more natural approach by minimizing the component’s probability of failure under a given tensile load. Since the fundamental work of Weibull, the probabilistic description of the strength of ceramics is standard and has been widely applied. Here, for the first time, the resulting failure probabilities are used as objective functions in PDE constrained shape optimization. To minimize the probability of failure, we choose a gradient based method combined with a first discretize then optimize approach. For discretization finite elements are used. Using the Lagrangian formalism, the shape gradient via the adjoint equation is calculated at low computational cost. The implementation is verified by comparison of it with a finite difference method applied to a minimal 2d example. Furthermore, we construct shape flows towards an optimal / improved shape in the case of a simple beam and a bended joint.","Matthias Bolten1, Hanno Gottschalk1, Camilla Hahn1 & …Mohamed Saadi",Computing and Visualization in Science,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00791-019-00315-z,"Minimization of failure probability,Shape optimization,Fracture mechanics,Point processes"

862,Numerical stability of the cyclic Richardson iteration,"The success of the cyclic Richardson iteration depends on the proper ordering of the acceleration parameters. We give a rigorous error analysis to show that, with the proper ordering, the relative error in the iterative method, when properly terminated, is not larger than the error incurred in stable direct methods such as Cholesky factorization. For both the computed approximation\(\tilde u\) tou=L
−1f satisfies\(\left\| {u - \tilde u} \right\|\) ≦ cond (L)‖u‖2−t and this bound is attainable. We also show that the residual norm\(\left\| {f - L\tilde u} \right\|\) is bounded by ‖L‖ cond\((L)\left\| {\tilde u} \right\|2^{ - t} \). This bound is attainable for a small cycle lengthN. Our analysis suggests that for a larger cycle lengthN the residuals are bounded by\(\sqrt {cond(L)} \left\| L \right\|\left\| {\tilde u} \right\|2^{ - t} \). We construct a theoretical example in which this bound is attainable. However we observed in all numerical tests that ultimately the residual norms were of order\(\left\| L \right\|\left\| {\tilde u} \right\|2^{ - t} \). We explain why in practice even the factor\(\sqrt {cond(L)} \) is never encountered. Therefore the residual stopping criterion for the Richardson iteration appears to be very reliable and the method itself appears to be stable.",Adam T.

Accuracte numerical simulation of shock-associated noise requires numerical scheme with high order accuracy, low dissipation and low dispersion as well as robust shock-capturing ability. The applicability of eight kinds of upwind/symmetric WENO schemes for the direct numerical simulation of screech tone is evaluated through comparison study on the spectral characteristics and direct numerical simulations of underexpanded supersonic cold jet issuing from circular sonic nozzle. The spectral characteristics based on the approximate dispersion relation shows that the adaptive central-upwind (WENO-SYMCU-6) scheme has the best resolution and the minimum value of point-per-wavelength. However, the comparison of nonlinear response indicates that the improved upwind WENO-ZM-5 (\(p=1\)) scheme has almost the weakest nonlinear response for the single Fourier mode. And the performances in the direct numerical simulations also show that the WENO-ZM-5 (\(p=1\)) scheme is the best. With this method, not only the screech tones of the high amplitude axisymmetric mode are obtained, but also a variety of high-frequency coupling modes with the highest amplitudes can be distinguished in a wider spectrum range. And there is no nonphysical high-frequency wave induced by the nonlinear implementation of WENO schemes at the near region of the nozzle exit lip.","Hu Li1,2, Yong Luo1,2 & Shuhai Zhang

872,Application of M-PML reflectionless boundary conditions to the numerical simulation of wave propagation in anisotropic media. Part I: Reflectivity,"This paper presents a detailed study of the construction of reflectionless boundary conditions for anisotropic elastic problems. A Multiaxial Perfectly Matched Layer (M-PML) approach is considered. With a proper stabilization parameter, the M-PML ensures solution stability for arbitrary anisotropic media. It is proved that this M-PML modification is not perfectly matched, and the reflectivity of the M-PML exceeds that of the standard PML. Moreover, the reflection coefficient linearly depends on the stabilization parameter. A problem of constructing an optimal stabilization parameter is formulated as follows: find a minimum possible parameter that ensures stability. This problem is considered in the second part of this work.","M. N. Dmitriev1,2 & V. V.

874,Application of Asymptotic and Numerical Methods to Determine Stability Boundaries of Distributed Systems in a Flow,"The reasons and the set of parameters leading to aeroelastic flutter vibrations in distributed systems (DS) are investigated on the basis of asymptotic and numerical methods. The instability is caused by the combined influence of three factors: the drift of perturbations along the DS in the flow, bending stiffness, and the influence of the inertial force, which is a distributed load moving along the DS. An increase in the tensile force and bending stiffness of the DS shifts the instability to a higher-frequency range of vibrations. An increase in the relative flux density and the relative length of the DS expands the region of instability. The presence of the angle of inclination of the DS to the flow adds peculiarities to the balance of forces acting on the DS and to the formation of the boundary ofstability and instability of regions. However, it is not possible to correctly assess its influence within the framework of the considered model and a more detailed further consideration is required. The configuration of the DS in the unstable region indicates the concentration of stresses near its upper end. The results obtained for small angles of inclination of the DS to the flow are consistent with the available results obtained by other authors.","I. Kaliukh1,2 & O.

Despite the fact that no complete error analysis for the method is yet available, the numerical results indicate that if no eigenvalues of \({\mathcal{M}}\) are close to the imaginary axis then the method computes the exact Hamiltonian Schur form of a nearby Hamiltonian matrix and thus is numerically strongly backward stable.

In this paper, we construct three numerical integrators that preserve one or two of the invariants making use of the Hamiltonian structure, and give theoretical analyses of the schemes. We also present several numerical examples, which not only confirm the effectiveness of the schemes but also suggest a new insight that some solutions of the mCH can behave like solitons.","Yuto Miyatake1, Takayasu Matsuo1 & Daisuke Furihata",Japan Journal of Industrial and Applied Mathematics,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13160-011-0043-z,"Modified Camassa–Holm equation,Conservation,Discrete variational derivative method"

CVFE (Control Volume Finite Element) and DDFV (Discrete Duality Finite Volume) schemes are analyzed and tested.

In general, the lack of density of the smooth functions in the energy space, related to the Lavrentiev phenomenon for the associated variational problems, makes it necessary to distinguish two notions of solutions, the narrow ones (the H-solutions) and the broad ones (the W-solutions).

The algorithm combines Peskin’s immersed-interface method with the diffuse-interface approximation, wherein the step discontinuity in the fluid properties is replaced by a transition zone defined in terms of a mollifying function. A finite-difference method is implemented for integrating the generalized Navier–Stokes equation incorporating the jump in the interfacial traction, and a finite-volume method is implemented for solving the surfactant transport equation over the evolving interface. The accuracy of the overall scheme is confirmed by successfully comparing the numerical results with the predictions of linear stability analysis and numerical simulations based on a boundary-element method for Stokes flow. Results for selected case studies suggest that inertial effects have a mild effect on the growth rate of the surfactant-induced Marangoni instability.",C.

888,The opportunistic replacement problem: theoretical analyses and numerical tests,"We consider a model for determining optimal opportunistic maintenance schedules w.r.t. a maximum replacement interval. This problem generalizes that of Dickman et al. (J Oper Res Soc India 28:165–175, 1991) and is a natural starting point for modelling replacement schedules of more complex systems. We show that this basic opportunistic replacement problem is NP-hard, that the convex hull of the set of feasible replacement schedules is full-dimensional, that all the inequalities of the model are facet-inducing, and present a new class of facets obtained through a \({\{0, \frac{1}{2}\}}\) -Chvátal–Gomory rounding. For costs monotone with time, a class of elimination constraints is introduced to reduce the computation time; it allows maintenance only when the replacement of at least one component is necessary. For costs decreasing with time, these constraints eliminate non-optimal solutions. When maintenance occasions are fixed, the remaining problem is stated as a linear program and solved by a greedy procedure. Results from a case study on aircraft engine maintenance illustrate the advantage of the optimization model over simpler policies. We include the new class of facets in a branch-and-cut framework and note a decrease in the number of branch-and-bound nodes and simplex iterations for most instance classes with time dependent costs. For instance classes with time independent costs and few components the elimination constraints are used favorably. For fixed maintenance occasions the greedy procedure reduces the computation time as compared with linear programming techniques for all instances tested.","Torgny Almgren1, Niclas Andréasson2, Michael Patriksson3,4, Ann-Brith Strömberg3,4, Adam Wojciechowski3,4 & …Magnus Önnheim3,",Mathematical Methods of Operations Research,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00186-012-0400-y,"Maintenance optimization,Mixed integer programming,Complexity analysis,Polyhedral analysis"

890,A Mathematical and Numerical Investigation of the Hemodynamical Origins of Oscillations in Microvascular Networks,"Evidence is presented to show that self-sustained oscillations of purely hemodynamical origin are possible in some arcade-type microvascular networks supplied with steady boundary conditions, but that in others the oscillations disappear with sufficient reduction of the time step Δt, showing them to be numerical artefacts. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the onset of fluctuations, we proceed to perform a linear stability analysis for the convective model of Kiani et al. (Microvasc. Res. 45:219–232, 1993; Am. J. Physiol. 266(35):H1822–H1828, 1994), and show that this leads via a system of delay differential equations to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. This result generalises the characteristic equation obtained by Carr et al. (Ann. Biomed. Eng. 33:764–771, 2005) and Geddes et al. (SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst. 6(4):694–727, 2007) who solved a special case in a two node network. An implicit numerical method is proposed for the computation of blood flows in networks using the convective model.In a moderate size subnetwork of one of the networks chosen by Kiani et al. (Am. J. Physiol. 266(35):H1822–H1828, 1994), the topology, vessel lengths, and diameters of which were based on microvascular networks in the rat mesentery, we compare results generated using the original explicit numerical method of Kiani et al.

891,A Numerical Investigation on Configurational Distortions in Nematic Liquid Crystals,"When subjected to magnetic or electric fields, nematic liquid crystals confined between two parallel glass plates and initially uniformly oriented may undergo homogeneous one-dimensional spatial distortions (Fréedericksz and Zolina, Trans.

According to the experimental observations, periodic phases are stable configurations at intermediate intensity of the acting field, while homogeneous phases are stable at higher strengths.We present a fully nonlinear finite element approach able to describe homogeneous and periodic configurational phases in a cell of confined nematic liquid crystal with strong planar anchoring boundary conditions. Stationary configurations are obtained by setting to zero the first variation of the discretized total energy of the system. Unstable configurations are identified by evaluating the behavior of the solution under small numerical perturbations. Numerical calculations are able to describe the evolution of the configurational distortions as a function of the applied field and are able to capture the critical points between homogeneous and periodic phases.

893,PDE-constrained optimization in medical image analysis,"PDE-constrained optimization problems find many applications in medical image analysis, for example, neuroimaging, cardiovascular imaging, and oncologic imaging. We review the related literature and give examples of the formulation, discretization, and numerical solution of PDE-constrained optimization problems for medical imaging. We discuss three examples. The first is image registration, the second is data assimilation for brain tumor patients, and the third is data assimilation in cardiovascular imaging. The image registration problem is a classical task in medical image analysis and seeks to find pointwise correspondences between two or more images. Data assimilation problems use a PDE-constrained formulation to link a biophysical model to patient-specific data obtained from medical images. The associated optimality systems turn out to be sets of nonlinear, multicomponent PDEs that are challenging to solve in an efficient way. The ultimate goal of our work is the design of inversion methods that integrate complementary data, and rigorously follow mathematical and physical principles, in an attempt to support clinical decision making. This requires reliable, high-fidelity algorithms with a short time-to-solution. This task is complicated by model and data uncertainties, and by the fact that PDE-constrained optimization problems are ill-posed in nature, and in general yield high-dimensional, severely ill-conditioned systems after discretization. These features make regularization, effective preconditioners, and iterative solvers that, in many cases, have to be implemented on distributed-memory architectures to be practical, a prerequisite. We showcase state-of-the-art techniques in scientific computing to tackle these challenges.","Andreas Mang1, Amir Gholami2, Christos Davatzikos3 & …George Biros",Optimization and Engineering,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-018-9390-9,"Optimal control,Medical imaging,PDE-constrained optimization,Memory-distributed algorithms"
894,Inertia effect on a structure of pressure-driven flames in porous media,"The phenomenon of a subsonic pressure-driven flame in an inert porous medium filled with a flammable gaseous mixture is considered in the present work. The paper focuses on the analysis of the impact of the inertia of a fluid on the fine structure of the flame front and its velocity. In the frame of reference attached to an advancing combustion wave and after a suitable non-dimensionalization the corresponding mathematical model includes three highly nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The system is converted into a singularly perturbed system of ODEs by a suitable choice of new phase coordinates and then treated analytically along the lines of a suggested asymptotic machinery (modified version of the method of invariant (integral) manifolds - MIM). According to the MIM, an arbitrary solution of the initial system of ODEs under consideration is represented as a trajectory in the phase space. It is shown that two principally different parts of the trajectory exist: fast motion from the initial point to a slow curve and another fast motion from the matching point lying on the slow curve to the singular (final) point of the system. The first stage is associated with a pre-heat subzone of the flame, whereas the second is interpreted as a reaction subzone. It is demonstrated that the matching point of these two parts of the trajectory plays a crucial role in the description of the flame characteristics. The proposed analytical approach allows one to obtain an analytical expression for the effect of inertia on the flame velocity. The theoretical predictions show reasonably good agreement with data resulting from direct numerical simulations.","Viatcheslav Bykov1, Igor Goldfarb1 & Vladimir Gol'dshtein",Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2004,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B%3AENGI.0000014895.52392.c2,"inertia of gas mixture,integral manifolds,porous media,pressure-driven flames,slow curve"

In studying approximate polynomials, we must consider two points, 1) the “error term’ may be quite large in approximate algebra, and 2) approximate polynomials show various pathological features occasionally. For example, as for 1), the error term may be of relative magnitude of 10−3 or even 10−2 in approximate factorization, and as for 2), conventional division algorithm leads to very inaccurate results if the leading coefficient of the divisor is small.

902,Numerical Schemes and Hybrid Approach for the Simulation of Unsteady Turbulent Flows,"AbstractThe paper presents a brief review of computational approaches for the simulation of turbulent flows and shows that the correct calculation of large-scale vortex structures necessarily requires the use of eddy-resolving methods, while the applied numerical schemes must be stable and accurately describe the spatial evolution of vortices. The dissipative properties and stability of most numerical schemes implemented in the OpenFOAM package are analyzed by solving problems on the decay of the homogeneous isotropic turbulence and scalar transfer. It is established that the considered schemes are not suitable for correctly calculating the propagation and dissipation of vortices in space; therefore, they are refined to eliminate oscillations and maintain an acceptable level of dissipation. An algorithm for combining the URANS and LES methods using zoning of the computational domain is described and implemented. To test the implemented calculation method of unsteady turbulent flows, we simulate the flow around a maneuvering aircraft with an installed airbrake deflection. The flow patterns of the aircraft and its aerodynamic characteristics are obtained and compared with the experimental data.","A. S.

Furthermore, Richardson extrapolation is implemented to improve the accuracy by accelerating up the rate of convergence of the upwind scheme to obtain a second order accuracy. Finally, a hybrid scheme is applied, wherein central difference scheme is applied on the finer mesh region and midpoint difference operator on the coarser mesh region. The hybrid scheme also provides a second order uniform convergence.

By applying dimensional analysis and owing to the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for tensors, a new turbulence enclosure model so-called the extended k-ε model has been developed. The coefficients of the model expression were determined by the wind tunnel experimental data of homogeneous shear turbulent flow. The model was compared with the standard k-ε model in its composition and the prediction of the Reynold's normal stresses. Using the new model the numerical simulation of wind flow around a square cross-section tall building was performed. The results show that the extended k-ε model improves the prediction of wind velocities around the building and wind pressures on the building envelope.","Chen Shuifu1, Sun Bingnan1 & Tang Jinchun",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,1998,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02458985,"turbulence model,Reynolds stress,wind flow,numerical simulation"

The fluid is a silicone oil (Prandtl number equal to 105) contained in a three-dimensional box bounded by rigid and impermeable walls with top free surface exposed to a gaseous phase. At the lateral box walls a different non-uniform temperature distribution is assumed so to induce horizontal convection and to keep separated thermocapillary and buoyancy effects. The vorticity-velocity formulation of the time-dependent Navier–Stokes equations for a non-isothermal incompressible fluid is used. A procedure based on a linearized fully implicit finite difference second order scheme has been adopted. We obtained very complex steady configurations for several values of the temperature difference at the lateral walls, ΔT=30, 40 and 50°C. Along the direction perpendicular to the lateral walls, for ΔT increasing, we observe a physically meaningful growth of heat transfer. Confidence in these results is supported by a comparison with recent experimental and numerical observations.",E. Bucchignani1 & D.

In order to solve numerically the above equation, whose solutions blow up in finite time, the authors advocate a numerical methodology based on the Strang’s symmetrized operator-splitting scheme. With this approach, one can decouple nonlinearity and differential operators, leading to the alternate solution at every time step of the equation as follows: (i) The first Painlevé ordinary differential equation, (ii) a linear wave equation with a constant coefficient. Assuming that the space dimension is two, the authors consider a fully discrete variant of the above scheme, where the space-time discretization of the linear wave equation sub-steps is achieved via a Galerkin/finite element space approximation combined with a second order accurate centered time discretization scheme. To handle the nonlinear sub-steps, a second order accurate centered explicit time discretization scheme with adaptively variable time step is used, in order to follow accurately the fast dynamic of the solution before it blows up. The results of numerical experiments are presented for different coefficients and boundary conditions.

940,"Numerical Convergence Study of Nearly Incompressible, Inviscid Taylor–Green Vortex Flow","A spectral method and a fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory method were used to examine the consequences of filtering in the numerical simulation of the three-dimensional evolution of nearly-incompressible, inviscid Taylor–Green vortex flow. It was found that numerical filtering using the high-order exponential filter and low-pass filter with sharp high mode cutoff applied in the spectral simulations significantly affects the convergence of the numerical solution. While the conservation property of the spectral method is highly desirable for fluid flows described by a system of hyperbolic conservation laws, spectral methods can yield erroneous results and conclusions at late evolution times when the flow eventually becomes under-resolved. In particular, it is demonstrated that the enstrophy and kinetic energy, which are two integral quantities often used to evaluate the quality of numerical schemes, can be misleading and should not be used unless one can assure that the solution is sufficiently well-resolved. In addition, it is shown that for the Taylor–Green vortex (for example) it is useful to compare the predictions of at least two numerical methods with different algorithmic foundations (such as a spectral and finite-difference method) in order to corroborate the conclusions from the numerical solutions when the analytical solution is not known.","Chi-Wang Shu1, Wai-Sun Don1, David Gottlieb1, Oleg Schilling2 & …Leland Jameson",Journal of Scientific Computing,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-004-5407-y,"spectral methods,weighted essentially non-oscillatory method,Taylor–Green vortex,convergence"

944,Numerical anisotropy in finite differencing,"Numerical solutions to hyperbolic partial differential equations, involving wave propagations in one direction, are subject to several specific errors, such as numerical dispersion, dissipation or aliasing. In the multi-dimensional case, where the waves propagate in all directions, there is an additional specific error resulting from the discretization of spatial derivatives along the grid lines. Specifically, waves or wave packets in the multi-dimensional case propagate at different phase or group velocities, respectively, along different directions. A commonly used term for the aforementioned multi-dimensional discretization error is the numerical anisotropy or isotropy error. In this review, the numerical anisotropy is briefly described in the context of the wave equation in the multi-dimensional case. Then several important studies that were focused on optimizations of finite difference schemes with the objective of reducing the numerical anisotropy are discussed.",Adrian Sescu,Advances in Difference Equations,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13662-014-0343-0,"Finite Difference Scheme,Advection Equation,Numerical Dispersion,Compact Scheme,Helmholtz Equation"

946,Comparison of Numerical Methods for the Computation of Energy Spectra in 2D Turbulence. Part I: Direct Methods,"The widely accepted theory of two-dimensional turbulence predicts a direct enstrophy cascade with an energy spectrum that behaves in terms of the frequency range k as k−3 and an inverse energy cascade with a k−5/3 decay. However, the graphic representation of the energy spectrum (even its shape) is closely related to the tool which is used to perform the numerical computation. With the same initial flow, eventually treated thanks to different tools such as wavelet decompositions or POD representations, the energy spectra are computed using direct various methods: FFT, auto-covariance function, auto regressive model, and wavelet transform. Numerical results are compared to each other and confronted with theoretical predictions. In a forthcoming part II some adaptative methods combined with the above direct ones will be developed.","Ch.

This facilitates the comparison of methods and generalizes considerably the concept of error constants.

Further, the effects of the viscous forces, Joule heating, heat source/sink, and radiation on the flow are taken into account. The non-dimensional transformations are used to solve the governing equations. Then, the reduced system is resolved by the fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method along with the shooting technique. The effects of different physical parameters on the heat transfer and entropy generation are discussed in detail through graphs. From the perspective of numerical results, it is recognized that the production of entropy can be improved with the Joule heating, viscous dissipation, and convective heating aspects. It is concluded that the production of entropy is the maximum with increases in the Casson parameter, the angle of inclination, and the Hartmann number.

954,A Numerical Framework for Integrating Deferred Correction Methods to Solve High Order Collocation Formulations of ODEs,"Recent analysis and numerical experiments show that the deferred correction methods are competitive numerical schemes for time dependent differential equations. These methods differ in the mathematical formulations, choices of collocation points, and numerical integration or differentiation strategies. Existing analyses of these methods usually follow traditional ODE theory and study each algorithm’s convergence and stability properties as the step size \(\varDelta t\) varies. In this paper, we study the deferred correction methods from a different perspective by separating two different concepts in the algorithm: (1) the properties of the converged solution to the collocation formulation, and (2) the convergence procedure utilizing the deferred correction schemes to iteratively and efficiently reduce the error in the provisional solution. This new viewpoint allows the construction of a numerical framework to integrate existing techniques, by (1) selecting an appropriate collocation discretization based on the physical properties of the solution to balance the time step size and accuracy of the initial approximate solution; and by (2) applying different deferred correction strategies for reducing different components in the error of the provisional solution. This paper discusses properties of different components in the numerical framework, and presents preliminary results on the effective integration of these components for ODE initial value problems. Our results provide useful guidelines for implementing “optimal” time integration schemes for general time dependent differential equations.","Wenzhen Qu1, Namdi Brandon2, Dangxing Chen2, Jingfang Huang2 & …Tyler Kress",Journal of Scientific Computing,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-015-0146-9,"Deferred correction methods,Krylov subspace methods ,Collocation formulations,Preconditioners,Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov methods"

956,Numerical and analytical solution to a conformable fractional Fornberg–Whitham equation,"In this work, we perform a broader analytical and numerical study of a space-time conformable fractional Fornberg–Whitham equation. The concept of conformable fractional Laplace transform was infused in the well-known homotopy analysis method (HAM), to obtain a more accurate solution. We named this method q-Homotopy Analysis Conformable Fractional Laplace Transform Method (q-HACFLTM). In addition, thorough numerical analysis using graphs and error analysis confirms that q-HACFLTM performs better and more accurately than the q-HAM technique previously applied to solve this problem. Moreover, the proposed method eliminates any form of restriction on the fractional order of the derivatives as was the case in the previous work of Iyiola and Ojo (Pramana J Phys 58(4): 567–575, 2005). Our method (q-HACFLTM) is quite easy and highly accurate and could be adopted for use in solving other fractional differential equation models, once similar properties of Laplace transform used here could be established. The q-HACFLTM technique applied here does not require any perturbation, discretization, polynomials or Lagrange multiplier, thus giving it some advantage over methods like ADM, HPTM or VIM, etc. The Laplace transform introduced was able to handle the nonlinear terms of the equation in a more robust manner, resulting in more accurate solution and faster convergence.","Cyril D.

959,Finite difference Wavelet–Galerkin method for the numerical solution of elastohydrodynamic lubrication problems,"The use of compactly supported wavelet functions has become increasingly popular in the development of numerical solutions for differential equations, especially for problems with local high gradient. Daubechies wavelets have been successfully used as base functions in several schemes like the Wavelet–Galerkin Method, due to their compact support, orthogonality, and multi-resolution properties.
 Another advantage of wavelet-based methods is the fact that the calculation of the inner products of wavelet basis functions and their derivatives can be made by solving a linear system of equations, thus avoiding the problem of approximating the integral by some numerical method. These inner products were defined as connection coefficients and they are employed in the calculation of stiffness, mass and geometry matrices. Solving connection coefficients in the Wavelet–Galerkin Method is complicated. In this work, Finite Difference Wavelet–Galerkin Method is developed for the numerical solution of elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) problems. This approach enables the use of the finite difference and multiresolution analysis. Using this method numerical solution (pressure (P) and film thickness (H)) of the EHL problem is obtained and presented in comparison with the finite difference solution in tables and figures. Finite difference Wavelet–Galerkin method is easier to implement than the Wavelet–Galerkin Method and it gives fast and accurate solution.

The numerical solution is obtained by using at any step an approximation of the matrix exponential, e.g. a polynomial or a rational approximation. We study the long-time behavior of \(\gamma _n\) by comparing it to the relative error \(\gamma _n^{\mathrm{long}}\) in the numerical integration of the long-time solution, i.e. the projection of the solution on the eigenspace of the rightmost eigenvalues. The error \( \gamma _n^{\mathrm{long}}\) grows linearly in time, it is small and it remains small in the long-time. We give a condition under which \(\gamma _n\approx \gamma _n^{\mathrm{long}}\), i.e. \(\frac{\gamma _n}{\gamma _n^{\mathrm{long}}}\approx 1\), in the long-time.

970,Numerical stability of biorthogonal wavelet transforms,"Biorthogonal wavelets are essential tools for numerous practical applications. It is very important that wavelet transforms work numerically stable in floating point arithmetic. This paper presents new results on the worst-case analysis of roundoff errors occurring in floating point computation of periodic biorthogonal wavelet transforms, i.e. multilevel wavelet decompositions and reconstructions. Both of these wavelet algorithms can be realized by matrix–vector products with sparse structured matrices. It is shown that under certain conditions the wavelet algorithms can be remarkably stable. Numerous tests demonstrate the performance of the results.","Gerlind Plonka1, Hagen Schumacher2 & Manfred Tasche",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-007-9034-7,"Biorthogonal wavelet transform,Low-pass filter,High-pass filter,Periodic wavelet transform,Wavelet decomposition,Wavelet reconstruction,Wavelet decomposition–reconstruction,Numerical stability"
971,Viscous fingering in yield stress fluids: a numerical study,"The effect of yield stress is numerically investigated on the viscous fingering phenomenon in a rectangular Hele–Shaw cell. It is assumed that the displacing fluid is Newtonian, while the displaced fluid is assumed to obey the bi-viscous Bingham model. The lubrication approximation together with the creeping-flow assumption is used to simplify the governing equations. The equations so obtained are made two-dimensional using the gap-averaged variables. The initially flat interface between the two (immiscible) fluids is perturbed by a waveform perturbation of arbitrary amplitude/wavelength to see how it grows in the course of time. Having treated the interfacial tension like a body force, the governing equations are solved using the finite-volume method to obtain the pressure and velocity fields. The volume-of-fluid method is then used for interface tracking. Separate effects of the Bingham number, the aspect ratio, the perturbation parameters (amplitude/wavelength), and the inlet velocity are examined on the steady finger width and the morphology of the fingers (i.e., tip-splitting and/or side-branching). It is shown that the shape of the fingers is dramatically affected by the fluid’s yield stress. It is also shown that a partial slip has a stabilizing effect on the viscous fingering phenomenon for yield-stress fluids.","Behnam Ebrahimi1, Peyman Mostaghimi2, Hamed Gholamian1 & …Kayvan Sadeghy1,",Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-015-9803-0,"Bi-viscous Bingham model,Saffman–Taylor instability,Slip boundary condition,Viscous fingering"
972,Numerical simulation for two-phase flow in a porous medium,"In this paper, we introduce a numerical study of the hydrocarbon system used for petroleum reservoir simulations. This system is a simplified model which describes a two-phase flow (oil and gas) with mass transfer in a porous medium, which leads to fluid compressibility. This kind of flow is modeled by a system of parabolic degenerated non-linear convection-diffusion equations. Under certain hypotheses, such as the validity of Darcy’s law, incompressibility of the porous medium, compressibility of the fluids, mass transfer between the oil and the gas, and negligible gravity, the global pressure formulation of Chavent (Mathematical Models and Finite Elements for Reservoir Simulation: Single Phase, Multiphase and Multicomponent Flows Through Porous Media, 1986) is formulated. This formulation allows the establishment of theoretical results on the existence and uniqueness of the solution (Gasmi and Nouri in Appl. Math. Sci. 7(42):2055-2064, 2013). Furthermore, different numerical schemes have been considered by many authors, among others we can refer the reader to (Chen in Finite element methods for the black oil model in petroleum reservoirs, 1994; Chen in Reservoir Simulation: Mathematical Techniques in Oil Recovery, 2007) and (Gagneux et al. in Rev.

973,Dynamic model of crop growth system and numerical simulation of crop growth process under the multi-environment external force action,"According to the biomechanic theory and method, the dynamic mechanism of crop growth under the external force action of multi-environment factors (light, temperature, soil and nutrients etc.) was comprehensively explored. Continuous-time Markov (CTM) approach was adopted to build the dynamic model of the crop growth system and the simulated numerical method. The growth rate responses to the variation of the external force and the change of biomass saturation value were studied. The crop grew in the semiarid area was taken as an example to carry out the numerical simulation analysis, therefore the results provide the quantity basis for the field management. Comparing the dynamic model with the other plant growth model, the superiority of the former is that it displays multi-dimension of resource utilization by means of combining macroscopic with microcosmic and reveals the process of resource transition. The simulation method of crop growth system is advanced and manipulated. A real simulation result is well identical with field observational results.","Li Zi-zhen Professor, Doctor1, Wang Wan-xiong Associate Professor2 & Xu Cai-lin",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02437875,"external force of environment,crop growth,dynamic model,numerical simulation"

975,Numerical investigation into the dependence of the Allen–Cahn equation on the free energy,"Phase-field modeling is strongly influenced by the shape of a free energy functional. In the theory of thermodynamics, it is a logarithmic type potential that is legitimate for modeling and simulating binary systems. Nevertheless, a tremendous amount of works have been dedicated to phase-field equations driven by 4-th double-well potentials as a polynomial approximation to the logarithmic type, which is valid only in the critical temperature regime. For comprehensive understanding of polynomial and logarithmic potentials and their relationship in the context of phase-field modeling, we provide and analyze a numerical framework for the Allen–Cahn equation derived from the Ginzburg–Landau functional with a logarithmic potential and its polynomial approximations. We prove that our numerical schemes guarantee the boundedness and energy dissipation properties of the solutions. As for the logarithmic free energy, we characterize different morphological changes of numerical solutions under various atomic binding energy configurations. Comparison of the logarithmic potential with its 2n-th order polynomial approximations reveals difference in the dynamics of spinodal decomposition. In particular, unlike the 6-th order or higher polynomials, the most studied solution by the 4-th order polynomial approximation using the 4-th double-well potential turns out to violate the logarithmic energy dissipation law. The geometric aspect of the Allen–Cahn equation with the logarithmic potential is also confirmed numerically. In summary, this study demonstrates the validity and applicability of the numerical framework for logarithmic and polynomial potentials and supports the need for further mathematical analysis on the logarithmic model.","Yunho Kim1 & Dongsun Lee

This difficulty can sometimes, but not always, be avoided by making use of coordinate transformations. In this paper we propose that the wrapping effect be reduced by enclosing the accumulated error in a convex polygon of a certain form, and we describe one possible way of choosing the faces of such a polygon.

In order to fulfill the aim, at first we develop and analyze an efficient numerical method by discretizing the model problem using a new finite difference scheme on an appropriate layer-adapted mesh in the spatial direction, and the time derivative using the backward-Euler method on an equidistant mesh. We adopt the two-stage discretization process to establish the parameter-uniform estimate in the discrete supremum norm; and provide stability analysis in both the temporal and spatial discretization cases. Afterwards, we apply the Richardson extrapolation technique solely in the temporal direction for enhancing the temporal accuracy. We finally show that the resulting numerical solution is globally second-order convergent with respect to both the spatial and the temporal variables. At the end, numerous numerical results are presented to corroborate the theoretical findings; and also to demonstrate the computational efficiency and the accuracy of the present numerical method in comparison with the existing numerical method. Besides this, we extend the computational experiment by solving the singularly perturbed semi-linear parabolic problem.","Narendra Singh Yadav1 & Kaushik Mukherjee

982,Semilinear Mixed Problems on Hilbert Complexes and Their Numerical Approximation,"Arnold, Falk, and Winther recently showed (Bull. Am. Math. Soc. 47:281–354, 2010) that linear, mixed variational problems, and their numerical approximation by mixed finite element methods, can be studied using the powerful, abstract language of Hilbert complexes. In another recent article (arXiv:1005.4455), we extended the Arnold–Falk–Winther framework by analyzing variational crimes (à la Strang) on Hilbert complexes. In particular, this gave a treatment of finite element exterior calculus on manifolds, generalizing techniques from surface finite element methods and recovering earlier a priori estimates for the Laplace–Beltrami operator on 2- and 3-surfaces, due to Dziuk (Lecture Notes in Math., vol. 1357:142–155, 1988) and later Demlow (SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 47:805–827, 2009), as special cases. In the present article, we extend the Hilbert complex framework in a second distinct direction: to the study of semilinear mixed problems. We do this, first, by introducing an operator-theoretic reformulation of the linear mixed problem, so that the semilinear problem can be expressed as an abstract Hammerstein equation. This allows us to obtain, for semilinear problems, a priori solution estimates and error estimates that reduce to the Arnold–Falk–Winther results in the linear case. We also consider the impact of variational crimes, extending the results of our previous article to these semilinear problems. As an immediate application, this new framework allows for mixed finite element methods to be applied to semilinear problems on surfaces.",Michael Holst1 & Ari Stern,Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-011-9110-8,"65N30,35J91,47H30"

995,On the numerical treatment of nonconvex energy problems of mechanics,"The present paper presents three numerical methods devised for the solution of hemivariational inequality problems. The theory of hemivariational inequalities appeared as a development of variational inequalities, namely an extension foregoing the assumption of convexity that is essentially connected to the latter. The methods that follow partly constitute extensions of methods applied for the numerical solution of variational inequalities. All three of them actually use the solution of a central convex subproblem as their kernel. The use of well established techniques for the solution of the convex subproblems makes up an effective, reliable and versatile family of numerical algorithms for large scale problems. The first one is based on the decomposition of the contigent cone of the (super)-potential of the problem into convex components. The second one uses an iterative scheme in order to approximate the hemivariational inequality problem with a sequence of variational inequality problems. The third one is based on the fact that nonconvexity in mechanics is closely related to irreversible effects that affect the Hessian matrix of the respective (super)-potential. All three methods are applied to solve the same problem and the obtained results are compared.","E. K. Koltsakis1, E. S. Mistakidis2 & M. Ap.

Dirac singularities will always be developed at boundary points as time evolves, which is known as the fixation phenomenon in genetic evolution. Three finite volume methods: FVM1-3, one central difference method: FDM1 and three finite element methods: FEM1-3 are considered. These methods lead to different equilibrium states after a long time. It is shown that only schemes FVM3 and FEM3, which are the same, preserve probability, expectation and positiveness and predict the correct probability of fixation. FVM1-2 wrongly predict the probability of fixation due to their intrinsic viscosity, even though they are unconditionally stable.

The numerical properties of a class of symmetric and asymmetric schemes are analysed. Implementation for the Navier–Stokes equations in cylindrical polar coordinates is discussed with particular attention given to treatment of the origin to ensure stability and efficiency. Validation of the schemes is carried out by detailed comparison with linear stability theory. The computer code is applied to study the initial stages of nonlinear development of unstable modes in a Mach 3 jet. The modes of instability that are present include strongly unstable axisymmetric acoustic and helical vortical waves, as well as weakly unstable radiating acoustic and vortical modes. Three distinctive wave patterns are observed from the simulations including a cross-hatched internal shock structure. Nonlinear interactions between the vortical and acoustic modes are investigated.",K. H. Luo1 & N. D.

1000,Numerical study of macroscopical drainage process in fabricating foamed aluminum using microscopical method,"The velocity field in a single Plateau border (PB) of the aluminum foam in the drainage process is studied using a mathematical model for the flow inside a microchannel. We show that the liquid/gas interface mobility characterized by the Newtonian surface viscosity has a substantial effect on the velocity inside the single PB. With the same liquid/gas interfacial mobility and the same radius of the curvature, the maximum velocity inside an exterior PB is about 6 ∼ 8 times as large as that inside an interior PB. We also find a critical value of the interfacial mobility in the interior PB. For the values greater and less than this critical value, the effects of the film thickness on the velocity in the PB show opposite tendencies. Based on the multiscale methodology, with the coupling between the microscale and the macroscale and the results obtained from the microscopical model, a simplified macroscopical drainage model is presented for the aluminum foams. The comparisons among the computational results obtained from the present model, the experimental data quoted in the literature, and the results of the classical drainage equation show a reasonable agreement. The computational results reveal that the liquid holdup of the foams is strongly dependent on the value of the mobility and the bubble radius.","Ke Li

1005,Natural damped vibrations of anisotropic box beams of polymer composite materials. 2. Numerical experiments,"The influence of the orientation of reinforcing fibers on the natural frequencies and mechanical loss coefficient of coupled vibrations of unsupported symmetric and asymmetric box beams, as evaluated in numerical experiments, is discussed. The calculations were performed under the assumption that the real parts of the complex moduli and mechanical loss coefficient are frequency-independent. Vibration modes were identified by their surface shapes. The boundaries of the regions of mutual transformation of interacting vibration modes were determined by the joint analysis of the dependences of the coupled and partial eigenfrequencies and the mechanical loss coefficients on the orientation angle of reinforcing fibers. It is established that vibrations of a symmetric box beam give rise to two primary interactions: bending–torsional and longitudinal–shear ones, which are united into a unique longitudinal–bending–torsional–shear interaction by the secondary interaction caused by transverse shear strains. Vibrations of an asymmetric box beam give rise to longitudinal–torsional and bending–bending (in two mutually orthogonal planes) interactions. It is shown that in a number of cases variation in the orientation angle of reinforcing fibers is accompanied with a mutual transformation of coupled vibration modes. If the differential equations for natural vibrations involve odd-order derivatives with respect to the spatial variable (a symmetric beam and the bending–bending interaction of an asymmetric beam), then, with variation in the orientation angle of reinforcing fibers, the mutual transformation of coupled vibration modes proceeds. If the differential equations for natural vibrations involve only even-order derivatives (the longitudinal–torsional interaction of an asymmetric beam), no mutual transformation of coupled vibration modes occurs.",V.

The LP approach naturally provides both upper and lower bounds on the quantities of interest.

Elastoplastic processes are described using the Prandtl-Reuss model. The spatial discretization of the Euler equations is carried out by the Godunov method on a moving grid. In order to improve the accuracy of the scheme, piecewise linear reconstruction of the grid functions is employed using a MUSCL-type interpolation scheme generalized to unstructured grids. The basic idea of the method is to split the system of governing equations into a hydrodynamic and an elastoplastic component. The hydrodynamic equations are solved by an absolutely stable explicit-implicit scheme, and the constitutive equations (elastoplastic component) are solved by a two-stage Runge-Kutta scheme. Theoretical analysis is performed and analytical solutions are obtained for a one-dimensional model describing the structures of a shock wave and a rarefaction wave in an elastoplastic material in the approximation of uniaxial strains. The proposed method is verified by the obtained analytical solutions and the solutions calculated using alternative approaches.","I. S. Menshov1,2, A. V. Mischenko2 & A. A.

1011,Numerical methods for nonlinear stochastic differential equations with jumps,"We present and analyse two implicit methods for Ito stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with Poisson-driven jumps. The first method, SSBE, is a split-step extension of the backward Euler method. The second method, CSSBE, arises from the introduction of a compensated, martingale, form of the Poisson process. We show that both methods are amenable to rigorous analysis when a one-sided Lipschitz condition, rather than a more restrictive global Lipschitz condition, holds for the drift. Our analysis covers strong convergence and nonlinear stability. We prove that both methods give strong convergence when the drift coefficient is one-sided Lipschitz and the diffusion and jump coefficients are globally Lipschitz. On the way to proving these results, we show that a compensated form of the Euler–Maruyama method converges strongly when the SDE coefficients satisfy a local Lipschitz condition and the pth moment of the exact and numerical solution are bounded for some p>2. Under our assumptions, both SSBE and CSSBE give well-defined, unique solutions for sufficiently small stepsizes, and SSBE has the advantage that the restriction is independent of the jump intensity. We also study the ability of the methods to reproduce exponential mean-square stability in the case where the drift has a negative one-sided Lipschitz constant. This work extends the deterministic nonlinear stability theory in numerical analysis. We find that SSBE preserves stability under a stepsize constraint that is independent of the initial data. CSSBE satisfies an even stronger condition, and gives a generalization of B-stability. Finally, we specialize to a linear test problem and show that CSSBE has a natural extension of deterministic A-stability. The difference in stability properties of the SSBE and CSSBE methods emphasizes that the addition of a jump term has a significant effect that cannot be deduced directly from the non-jump literature.",Desmond J.

Using appropriately chosen Hilbert spaces, it is shown that the kernel gives rise to a mapping which is the sum of a unitary operator and a compact operator. This enables us to study the problem in terms of an equivalent integral equation of the second kind. Using Galerkin's method, we are able to derive a convergent numerical algorithm for its solution.

Self-excited attractors can be localized numerically by a standard computational procedure, in which after a transient process a trajectory starting from a point of unstable manifold in a neighborhood of equilibrium reaches a state of oscillation, and therefore one can readily identify it. In contrast, for a hidden attractor, the basin of attraction does not intersect with small neighborhoods of equilibria. While classical attractors are self-excited, attractors can therefore be obtained numerically by the standard computational procedure. For localization of hidden attractors, it is necessary to develop special procedures, since there are no similar transient processes leading to such attractors. In this paper, we propose a new efficient analytical-numerical method for the study of hidden oscillations in multidimensional dynamical systems.","I. M.

1018,A hybrid asymptotic-numerical method for calculating drag coefficients in 2-D low Reynolds number flows,"Steady-state incompressible low-Reynolds-number fluid flow past a cylindrical body in an unbounded two-dimensional domain is a singular perturbation problem involving an infinite logarithmic expansion in the Reynolds number \({\displaystyle \varepsilon }\) as \({\displaystyle \varepsilon }\rightarrow 0\). The central difficulty with applying a conventional matched asymptotic approach to this problem is that only the first few terms in the infinite logarithmic expansion of the drag coefficient and of the flow field can be calculated analytically. To overcome this difficulty, a hybrid asymptotic-numerical method that incorporates all logarithmic correction terms is implemented for three low-Reynolds-number flow problems. In particular, for a nanocylinder of circular cross section with surface roughness, modeled by a Navier boundary condition involving a sliplength parameter, a hybrid asymptotic-numerical method is formulated and implemented to determine an approximation to the drag coefficient that is accurate to all powers of \({-1/\log {\displaystyle \varepsilon }}\). A similar analysis is done to determine a corresponding approximation of the drag coefficient for a porous cylinder, where the flow inside the cylinder is modeled by the Brinkman equation. For both the nano- and porous-cylinder problems, the hybrid asymptotic-numerical method is extended to calculate the first transcendentally small correction term to the Stokes flow near a body. This term, which governs weak upstream/downstream asymmetry in the Stokes flow, is extrapolated to finite \({\displaystyle \varepsilon }\) to predict the formation of any eddies near the body. Finally, the hybrid method is used to determine the drag coefficient, valid to within all logarithmic terms, for two identical cylinders of circular cross section in tandem alignment with the free stream. An extension of the theoretical framework to more general slow viscous flow problems is discussed.",Sarah Hormozi1 & Michael J.

The infinite state representation contains an improper integral with respect to frequency, expressing the history dependence of the fractional derivative. The integral generally has a weakly singular kernel, which may lead to problems in numerical computations. A reformulation of the integral generates a kernel that decays to zero at both ends of the integration interval leading to better convergence properties of the related numerical scheme.

In the first numerical scheme, we explore a fractional step method (operator splitting) to decouple the phase-field (Cahn–Hilliard equation) from the velocity field (Stokes–Darcy fluid equations). To further decouple the Stokes–Darcy system, we introduce a first order pressure stabilization term in the Darcy solver in the second numerical scheme so that the Stokes system is decoupled from the Darcy system and hence the CHSD system can be solved in a fully decoupled manner. We show that both decoupled numerical schemes are uniquely solvable, energy stable, and mass conservative.

1025,Superconvergence and the Numerical Flux: a Study Using the Upwind-Biased Flux in Discontinuous Galerkin Methods,"One of the beneficial properties of the discontinuous Galerkin method is the accurate wave propagation properties. That is, the semi-discrete error has dissipation errors of order \(2k+1\) (\(\le Ch^{2k+1}\)) and order \(2k+2\) for dispersion (\(\le Ch^{2k+2}\)). Previous studies have concentrated on the order of accuracy, and neglected the important role that the error constant, C,  plays in these estimates. In this article, we show the important role of the error constant in the dispersion and dissipation error for discontinuous Galerkin approximation of polynomial degree k,  where \(k=0,1,2,3.\) This gives insight into why one may want a more centred flux for a piecewise constant or quadratic approximation than for a piecewise linear or cubic approximation. We provide an explicit formula for these error constants. This is illustrated through one particular flux, the upwind-biased flux introduced by Meng et al., as it is a convex combination of the upwind and downwind fluxes. The studies of wave propagation are typically done through a Fourier ansatz. This higher order Fourier information can be extracted using the smoothness-increasing accuracy-conserving (SIAC) filter. The SIAC filter ties the higher order Fourier information to the negative-order norm in physical space. We show that both the proofs of the ability of the SIAC filter to extract extra accuracy and numerical results are unaffected by the choice of flux.","Daniel J. Frean1 & Jennifer K. Ryan

1026,Numerical simulation of piezoelectrically agitated surface acoustic waves on microfluidic biochips,"Microfluidic biochips are biochemical laboratories on the microscale that are used for genotyping and sequencing in genomics, protein profiling in proteomics, and cytometry in cell analysis. There are basically two classes of such biochips: active devices, where the solute transport on a network of channels on the chip surface is realized by external forces, and passive chips, where this is done using a specific design of the geometry of the channel network. Among the active biochips, current interest focuses on devices whose operational principle is based on piezoelectrically driven surface acoustic waves (SAWs) generated by interdigital transducers placed on the chip surface. In this paper, we are concerned with the numerical simulation of such piezoelectrically agitated SAWs relying on a mathematical model that describes the coupling of the underlying piezoelectric and elastomechanical phenomena. Since the interdigital transducers usually operate at a fixed frequency, we focus on the time-harmonic case. Its variational formulation gives rise to a generalized saddle point problem for which a Fredholm alternative is shown to hold true. The discretization of the time-harmonic surface acoustic wave equations is taken care of by continuous, piecewise polynomial finite elements with respect to a nested hierarchy of simplicial triangulations of the computational domain. The resulting algebraic saddle point problems are solved by blockdiagonally preconditioned iterative solvers with preconditioners of BPX-type.

1028,3D numerical simulation on fluid-structure interaction of structure subjected to underwater explosion with cavitation,"In the underwater-shock environment, cavitation occurs near the structural surface. The dynamic response of fluid-structure interactions is influenced seriously by the cavitation effects. It is also the difficulty in the field of underwater explosion. With the traditional boundary element method and the finite element method (FEM), it is difficult to solve the nonlinear problem with cavitation effects subjected to the underwater explosion. To solve this problem, under the consideration of the cavitation effects and fluid compressibility, with fluid viscidity being neglected, a 3D numerical model of transient nonlinear fluid-structure interaction subjected to the underwater explosion is built. The fluid spectral element method (SEM) and the FEM are adopted to solve this model. After comparison with the FEM, it is shown that the SEM is more precise than the FEM, and the SEM results are in good coincidence with benchmark results and experiment results. Based on this, combined with ABAQUS, the transient fluid-structure interaction mechanism of the 3D submerged spherical shell and ship stiffened plates subjected to the underwater explosion is discussed, and the cavitation region and its influence on the structural dynamic responses are presented. The paper aims at providing references for relevant research on transient fluid-structure interaction of ship structures subjected to the underwater explosion.","A-man Zhang

We show that this phenomenon occurs when the singular point s is located at the midpoint of each subinterval and obtain the corresponding supercovergence analysis. Then we apply the rule to construct a collocation scheme for solving the relevant hypersingular integral equation, by choosing the midpoints as the collocation points.

We carry out a rigorous numerical stability analysis of each of these methods. This has not previously been done for solution schemes for the thin wire EFIEs.

The distribution defining the solutions is taken to be defined only on the relevant manifold and hence all the intermediate points occuring in the computations are projected orthogonally to the manifold. We analyse the order of such methods, and somewhat surprisingly there does not appear any new order conditions for the Runge—Kutta methods in our context, at least up to order 4. The analysis shows that some terms appearing in the error expansions can be quite naturally expressed in terms of standard notions of Riemannian geometry.

1035,Overcoming the Curse of Dimensionality in the Numerical Approximation of Parabolic Partial Differential Equations with Gradient-Dependent Nonlinearities ,"Partial differential equations (PDEs) are a fundamental tool in the modeling of many real-world phenomena. In a number of such real-world phenomena the PDEs under consideration contain gradient-dependent nonlinearities and are high-dimensional. Such high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs can in nearly all cases not be solved explicitly, and it is one of the most challenging tasks in applied mathematics to solve high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs approximately. It is especially very challenging to design approximation algorithms for nonlinear PDEs for which one can rigorously prove that they do overcome the so-called curse of dimensionality in the sense that the number of computational operations of the approximation algorithm needed to achieve an approximation precision of size \({\varepsilon }> 0\) grows at most polynomially in both the PDE dimension \(d \in \mathbb {N}\) and the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy \({\varepsilon }\). In particular, to the best of our knowledge there exists no approximation algorithm in the scientific literature which has been proven to overcome the curse of dimensionality in the case of a class of nonlinear PDEs with general time horizons and gradient-dependent nonlinearities. It is the key contribution of this article to overcome this difficulty. More specifically, it is the key contribution of this article (i) to propose a new full-history recursive multilevel Picard approximation algorithm for high-dimensional nonlinear heat equations with general time horizons and gradient-dependent nonlinearities and (ii) to rigorously prove that this full-history recursive multilevel Picard approximation algorithm does indeed overcome the curse of dimensionality in the case of such nonlinear heat equations with gradient-dependent nonlinearities.","Martin Hutzenthaler1, Arnulf Jentzen2,3 & Thomas Kruse",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-021-09514-y,"Curse of dimensionality,Partial differential equation,PDE,Backward stochastic differential equation,BSDE,Multilevel Picard,Multilevel Monte Carlo,Gradient-dependent nonlinearity"
1036,Spectral variational integrators,"In this paper, we present a new variational integrator for problems in Lagrangian mechanics. Using techniques from Galerkin variational integrators, we construct a scheme for numerical integration that converges geometrically, and is symplectic and momentum preserving. Furthermore, we prove that under appropriate assumptions, variational integrators constructed using Galerkin techniques will yield numerical methods that are arbitrarily high-order. In particular, if the quadrature formula used is sufficiently accurate, then the resulting Galerkin variational integrator has a rate of convergence at the discrete time-steps that is bounded below by the approximation order of the finite-dimensional function space. In addition, we show that the continuous approximating curve that arises from the Galerkin construction converges on the interior of the time-step at half the convergence rate of the solution at the discrete time-steps. We further prove that certain geometric invariants also converge with high-order, and that the error associated with these geometric invariants is independent of the number of steps taken. We close with several numerical examples that demonstrate the predicted rates of convergence.",James Hall1 & Melvin Leok,Numerische Mathematik,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-014-0679-0,"37M15,65M70,65P10,70H25"

The model is described by the advection-diffusion boundary-value problem with a system of two differential equations. In view of the specific features of the input parameters of the problem, when the advection coefficient significantly exceeds the diffusion coefficient, the application of the classical finite-element method with linear and quadratic basis functions leads to the loss of stability of the computational process. We propose a new approach to the solution of the advection-diffusion problems with large Péclet numbers based on the replacement of the unknown function by an exponential function in the formulation of the problem and the inverse replacement prior to the application of the finite-element method. We also perform the numerical analysis of the results obtained by the application of the proposed method for the approximate solution of the problem of propagation of drugs in the wall of a vessel.",Ya.

1039,Numerical study on the instability of localized buckling modes in the axially compressed strut on a distributed-spring elastic foundation with softening quadratic nonlinearity,"Localized buckling modes in the axially compressed strut on a distributed-spring elastic foundation with a softening quadratic nonlinearity are numerically calculated based on a modified Petviashvili method in the spatial frequency domain. As the load decreases (increases), the maximum displacement of the corresponding localized buckling mode increases (decreases) and its width decreases (increases). Then, under the influence of longitudinal and transverse perturbations, stabilities of these localized buckling modes are numerically investigated. The adopted numerical method is the spatial Fourier transform in space and the finite difference method in time. For initial positive longitudinal perturbations, localized buckling modes are unstable showing focusing-type finite-time blowup singularities. For initial negative perturbations, localized buckling modes are unstable and become dispersed showing small-amplitude oscillations. For initial transverse perturbations, localized buckling modes are unstable and are transformed into three-dimensional locally confined modes, finally showing finite-time blowup singularities.","Youn J.

The first step consists of rigorously computing high order parametrizations of the local stable and unstable manifolds. If the local manifolds intersect, the Newton–Kantorovich theorem is applied to validate the existence of a so-called short connecting orbit. If the local manifolds do not intersect, a boundary value problem with boundary values in the local manifolds is rigorously solved by a contraction mapping argument on a ball centered at the numerical solution, yielding the existence of a so-called long connecting orbit. In both cases our argument yields transversality of the corresponding intersection of the manifolds. The method is applied to the Lorenz equations, where a study of a pitchfork bifurcation with saddle-to-saddle stability is done and where several proofs of existence of short and long connections are obtained.","Jean-Philippe Lessard1, Jason D.

We show here that this framework can be applied to a family of degenerate non-linear parabolic equations (which contain in particular the Richards’, Stefan’s and Leray–Lions’ models), and we prove a uniform-in-time strong-in-space convergence result for the gradient scheme approximations of these equations. In order to establish this convergence, we develop several discrete compactness tools for numerical approximations of parabolic models, including a discontinuous Ascoli–Arzelà theorem and a uniform-in-time weak-in-space discrete Aubin–Simon theorem.

A coupling algorithm is presented, which allows a flexible use of finite element method and boundary element method as local discretization techniques.

1047,Retinal oxygen distribution and the role of neuroglobin,"The retina is the tissue layer at the back of the eye that is responsible for light detection. Whilst equipped with a rich supply of oxygen, it has one of the highest oxygen demands of any tissue in the body and, as such, supply and demand are finely balanced. It has been suggested that the protein neuroglobin (Ngb), which is found in high concentrations within the retina, may help to maintain an adequate supply of oxygen via the processes of transport and storage. We construct mathematical models, formulated as systems of reaction–diffusion equations in one-dimension, to test this hypothesis. Numerical simulations show that Ngb may play an important role in oxygen transport, but not in storage. Our models predict that the retina is most susceptible to hypoxia in the regions of the photoreceptor inner segment and inner plexiform layers, where Ngb has the potential to prevent hypoxia and increase oxygen uptake by 30–40 %. Analysis of a simplified model confirms the utility of Ngb in transport and shows that its oxygen affinity (\(P_{50}\) value) is near optimal for this process. Lastly, asymptotic analysis enables us to identify conditions under which the piecewise linear and quadratic approximations to the retinal oxygen profile, used in the literature, are valid.","Paul A.

However, effective numerical methods and supporting error analysis for the fractional equations which describe the process of wound healing are still limited.In this paper, we consider the numerical simulation of a fractional mathematical model of epidermal wound healing (FMM-EWH), which is based on the coupled advection-diffusion equations for cell and chemical concentration in a polar coordinate system. The space fractional derivatives are defined in the Left and Right Riemann-Liouville sense. Fractional orders in the advection and diffusion terms belong to the intervals (0,1) or (1,2], respectively. Some numerical techniques will be used. Firstly, the coupled advection-diffusion equations are decoupled to a single space fractional advection-diffusion equation in a polar coordinate system. Secondly, we propose a new implicit difference method for simulating this equation by using the equivalent of Riemann-Liouville and Grünwald-Letnikov fractional derivative definitions. Thirdly, its stability and convergence are discussed, respectively. Finally, some numerical results are given to demonstrate the theoretical analysis.","J. Chen1, F. Liu2, K. Burrage3 & …S.

The mathematical model for the numerical simulations is based on the enthalpy-porosity method in vorticity-velocity formulation, equations are discretised on a fixed grid by means of a finite volume technique. A fully implicit method has been adopted for the mass and momentum equations. Experiments are performed for water in a differentially heated cube surrounded by air. The experimental data for natural convection with freezing in the cavity are collected to create a reference for comparison with numerical results. The method of simultaneous measurement of the flow and temperature fields using liquid crystal tracers is used. It allows us to collect transient data on the interface position, and the temperature and velocity fields. In order to improve the capability of the numerical method to predict experimental results, a conjugate heat transfer problem was solved, with finite thickness and internal heat conductivity of the non-isothermal walls. These results have been compared with the simulations obtained for the idealised case of perfectly adiabatic side walls, and with our experimental findings. Results obtained for the improved numerical model shown a very good agreement with the experimental data only for pure convection and initial time of freezing process. As time passes the discrepancies between numerical predictions and the experiment became more significant, suggesting a necessity for further improvements of the physical model used for freezing water.","Marilena Giangi1, Fulvio Stella1 & Tomasz A.

The contact is modeled with the normal compliance condition with finite penetration, the regularized Coulomb law, and the regularized electrical conductivity condition. The existence and uniqueness results are provided using the theory of variational inequalities and Schauder’s fixed-point theorem.

(J Sci Comput 42(1):68, 2009, Quart Appl Math 65(2):259–279, 2007). All characteristic fields are carefully studied and explicit expressions are derived for the Riemann invariants and the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions. Due to the presence of multiple characteristics in the system under consideration, non-standard wave phenomena can occur. Therefore we briefly review admissibility conditions for discontinuities and then discuss possible wave interactions. In particular we will show that overlapping rarefaction waves are possible and moreover we may have shocks that lie inside a rarefaction wave. In contrast to nonconservative two phase flow models, such as the Baer–Nunziato system, we can use the advantage of the conservative form of the model under consideration. Furthermore, we show the relation between the considered conservative SHTC system and the corresponding barotropic version of the nonconservative Baer–Nunziato model. Additionally, we derive the reduced four equation Kapila system for the case of instantaneous relaxation, which is the common limit system of both, the conservative SHTC model and the non-conservative Baer–Nunziato model. Finally, we compare exact solutions of the Riemann problem with numerical results obtained for the conservative two-phase flow model under consideration, for the non-conservative Baer–Nunziato system and for the Kapila limit. The examples underline the previous analysis of the different wave phenomena, as well as differences and similarities of the three systems.

1130,A new method for the numerical solution of the Reynolds equation for gas-lubricated slider bearings,"The steady-state Reynolds equation for gas lubricating leads to a quasilinear boundary-value problem in two dimensions. This equation contains a first-order derivative term whose coefficient is nonlinear and also large for most of the practical cases. Thus, this becomes a quasilinear singular perturbation problem. Existing numerical schemes are faced with the failure of convergence as well as numerical instability which often results in overshooting the answers. Asymptotic approximations also give poor results if the film-thickness ratios are not small. In this paper an accurate and reliable numerical scheme is presented. Convergence is proved independent of the bearing numbers and film-thickness ratios. A weighted upwind-difference form is used to discretize the differential equation. Theory of M-matrices and associated inequalities are employed to prove the ensuing monotonicity. The analysis presented in this paper can be extended to a more general class of singular-perturbation quasilinear boundary-value problems.

1131,Numerical Simulation of Fluid-Structure Interaction Using Modified Ghost Fluid Method and Naviers Equations,"
In this work, we deal with the 1D compressible fluid coupled with elastic solid in an Eulerian-Lagrangian system. To facilitate the analysis, the Naviers equation for elastic solid is cast into a 2×2 system similar to the Euler equation but in Lagrangian coordinate. The modified Ghost Fluid Method is employed to treat the fluid-elastic solid coupling, where an Eulerian-Lagrangian Riemann problem is defined and a nonlinear characteristic from the fluid and a Riemann invariant from the solid are used to predict and define the ghost fluid states. Theoretical analysis shows that the present approach is accurate in the sense of approximating the solution of the Riemann problem at the interface. Numerical validation of this approach is also accomplished by extensive comparison to 1D problems (both water-solid and gas-solid) with their respective analytical solutions.

This method is based on interpolation by radial basis functions including multiquadric (MQ), using Legendre–Gauss–Radau nodes and weights. The proposed method does not require any background mesh or cell structures, so it is meshless and consequently independent of the geometry of domain. Newton method is employed for solving the nonlinear system obtained with MQ RBF collocation method. Also a theorem is proved for convergence analysis. Some numerical examples are presented and the results are compared with the analytical solution to demonstrate the validity and the applicability of the proposed method.","Khosrow Maleknejad1, Hossein Mohammadikia1 & Jalil Rashidinia",Afrika Matematika,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13370-018-0589-x,"Nonlinear system of Volterra–Fredholm integral equations,Radial basis function,Legendre–Gauss–Radau"

The Lyapunov exponents for the fractional-order chaotic systems have been calculated to characterize the behaviors of the dynamics of the considered fractional-order system. The stability analysis of the equilibrium points of the considered model has been investigated with two methods. The phase portraits of the fractional chaotic model studied in this paper have been obtained via the fractional linear multistep method and Adams–Basford method. The fractional operators in our modeling are the Caputo derivative, the fractional derivative with the Mittag–Leffler kernel, and the Caputo–Fabrizio fractional derivative. The circuit schematics for the fractional version of our presented model regarding resistors and capacitors have been proposed to confirm the theoretical results.","Ndolane Sene

By taking the view that artificial recurrent neural nets are dynamical systems described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), new neural nets were recently derived in the literature using a unified control Liapunov function (CLF) approach, after interpreting the zero finding problem as a regulation problem for a closed-loop continuous-time dynamical system. The resulting neural net or continuous-time ODE is discretized by Euler’s method and the discretization step size interpreted as a control which is chosen so as to optimize the decrement in the chosen CLF, along system trajectories. Given the viewpoint adopted in this article, the words dynamical system, ODE and neural net are used interchangeably. For standard test functions of two variables, the basins of attraction are found by numerical simulation, starting from a uniformly distributed grid of initial points. For the chosen test functions, analysis of the basins shows a correlation between regularity of the basin boundaries and the predictability of convergence to a zero. In addition, this analysis suggests how to construct a team algorithm with favorable convergence properties.",Fernando A.

Here, approximation theory for fully-connected neural networks predicts that the performance of the model should depend only very mildly on the dimension of the parameter space and is determined by the intrinsic dimension of the solution manifold of the parametric partial differential equation. We use various methods to establish comparability between test-cases by minimizing the effect of the choice of test-cases on the optimization and sampling aspects of the learning problem.

A reduction of the isotropy error is attained for large wave numbers and, most notably, the stability restrictions associated with MacCormack time marching schemes are considerably improved.

We will present and compare methods to construct approximations of the solution which have tensor structure and the computational effort is governed by only solving elliptic problems on lower-dimensional domains. A zero-th order tensor approximation is derived by using tools from asymptotic analysis (method 1). The resulting approximation is an elementary tensor and, hence has a fixed error which turns out to be very close to the best possible approximation of zero-th order. This approximation can be used as a starting guess for the derivation of higher-order tensor approximations by a greedy-type method (method 2). Numerical experiments show that this method is converging towards the exact solution. Method 3 is based on the derivation of a tensor approximation via exponential sums applied to discretized differential operators and their inverses.

involved bilinear forms. The considerations are restricted to piecewise

the optimum rate of convergence\(O (h)\)

cases a quadrature formula of first degree of precision is used.
Quadrature formulas with degree of precision equal to zero are also
analyzed and in the case when the exact eigenfunctions belong only to\(H^1(\Omega )\)

1163,Numerical Simulation of Low Mach Number Reactive Flows,"A new formulation for the numerical solution of low Mach number compressible flow problems is presented and analyzed. In this formulation the thermal part (energy and species equations) is solved implicitly and decoupled from the momentum equation, whereas the hydrodynamic part (momentum-continuity) is advanced in time using a high order splitting approach which results in overall high order accuracy in time and minimal errors in mass conservation. These errors are analyzed using both analytical tools and benchmark numerical examples. Results from two-dimensional simulations with one-step global reaction in opposed jet flame and porous particle configurations are also presented.","A. G. Tomboulides1 nAff2, J. C. Y. Lee1 nAff2 & S.

1164,Numerical exploitation of symmetry in integral equations,"Linear integral operators describing physical problems on symmetric domains often are equivariant, which means that they commute with certain symmetries, i.e., with a group of orthogonal transformations leaving the domain invariant. Under suitable discretizations the resulting system matrices are also equivariant. A method for exploiting this equivariance in the numerical solution of linear equations and eigenvalue problems via symmetry reduction is described. A very significant reduction in the computational expense in both the assembling of the system matrix and in solving linear systems can be obtained in this way. This reduction is particularly important because the system matrices are typically full. The basic ideas underlying our method and its analysis involve group representation theory. We concentrate here on the use of symmetry adapted bases and their automated generation. In this paper symmetry reduction is studied in connection with quadrature formulae and the Nyström method. A software package has been posted on the Internet.",Eugene L.

1165,On the effect of numerical integration in the finite element solution of an elliptic problem with a nonlinear Newton boundary condition,"This paper is concerned with the analysis of the finite element method for the numerical solution of an elliptic boundary value problem with a nonlinear Newton boundary condition in a two-dimensional polygonal domain. The weak solution loses regularity in a neighbourhood of boundary singularities, which may be at corners or at roots of the weak solution on edges. The main attention is paid to the study of error estimates. It turns out that the order of convergence is not dampened by the nonlinearity if the weak solution is nonzero on a large part of the boundary. If the weak solution is zero on the whole boundary, the nonlinearity only slows down the convergence of the function values but not the convergence of the gradient. The same analysis is carried out for approximate solutions obtained by numerical integration. The theoretical results are verified by numerical experiments.","Ondřej Bartoš1, Miloslav Feistauer1 & Filip Roskovec",Applications of Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.21136/AM.2019.0192-18,"elliptic equation,nonlinear Newton boundary condition,weak solution,finite element discretization,numerical integration,error estimation,effect of numerical integration"
1166,Stable and accurate numerical methods for generalized Kirchhoff–Love plates,"Kirchhoff–Love plate theory is widely used in structural engineering. In this paper, efficient and accurate numerical algorithms are developed to solve a generalized Kirchhoff–Love plate model subject to three common physical boundary conditions: (i) clamped; (ii) simply supported; and (iii) free. The generalization stems from the inclusion of additional physics to the classical Kirchhoff–Love model that accounts for bending only. We solve the model equation by discretizing the spatial derivatives using second-order finite-difference schemes, and then advancing the semi-discrete problem in time with either an explicit predictor–corrector or an implicit Newmark-Beta time-stepping algorithm. Stability analysis is conducted for the schemes, and the results are used to determine stable time steps in practice. A series of carefully chosen test problems are solved to demonstrate the properties and applications of our numerical approaches. The numerical results confirm the stability and 2nd-order accuracy of the algorithms and are also comparable with experiments for similar thin plates. As an application, we illustrate a strategy to identify the natural frequencies of a plate using our numerical methods in conjunction with a fast Fourier transformation power spectrum analysis of the computed data. Then we take advantage of one of the computed natural frequencies to simulate the interesting physical phenomena known as resonance and beat for a generalized Kirchhoff–Love plate.","Duong T. A.

Then, these approximations are applied to the Volterra–Fredholm integral equations system, which turns it into a linear system that is solvable by conventional methods.

1168,Numerical Solution of Multidimensional Hyperbolic PDEs Using Defect Correction on Adaptive Grids,"We propose a novel computational approach to obtain high order accurate, finite difference based numerical solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations, through a combination of grid adaptation, non-iterative defect correction and monotonicity preserving interpolation methods. Reduction of local truncation error is achieved primarily due to a particular choice of an adaptive, non-uniform grid where the local Courant–Friedrich–Levy number is unity, along with non-iterative defect correction. A monotonicity preserving interpolant is further used to map the dependent variables from the non-uniform to uniform grids and vice versa. Dimensional splitting techniques are used to extend the range of application of this method from single to multiple dimensions. Using the monotonicity preserving feature of this interpolant, finite difference schemes with high order of accuracy are developed for solving multidimensional, hyperbolic PDEs. In this work, for the proof of concept, five canonical problems including Liouville equations (in one and two dimensions) with spatially dependent drift coefficients and one-dimensional Burgers equation as well as a two-dimensional nonlinear hyperbolic equation are solved. The results demonstrate four major features of the proposed methodology including: (1) the capability to improve the order of accuracy of difference schemes up to any desired level, (2) the ability to obtain the given level of accuracy at a lower computational cost (or time) when compared to some widely used standard finite difference schemes (3) accurate oscillation-free resolution of discontinuities and (4) the computational simplicity for application to multidimensional problems.","Mani Razi1, Peter Attar1 & Prakash Vedula",Journal of Scientific Computing,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-016-0209-6,"Adaptive finite difference solution,Dimensional splitting,Modified differential equation,Multidimensional hyperbolic equations,Non-iterative defect correction,Order of accuracy"

The elasticity problem is formulated using complex Goursat functions, resulting in a set of singular integro-differential equations on the boundary. The resulting boundary integral equations are solved numerically using a Chebyshev collocation method which is augmented by a fractional power term, derived by asymptotic analysis of the corner region, to resolve stress singularities at corners of the hole. We apply our numerical method to the test case of the hole formed by two partially overlapping circles, which can include either a corner pointing into the solid or a corner pointing out of the solid. Our numerical results recover the exact stress on the boundary to within relative error \(10^{-3}\) for modest computational effort.","Weiqi Wang

Another new concept called the fracture asymmetry coefficient is used to define the asymmetry of the fracture about the well. Finite element method (FEM) is used to solve the new mathematical model. The well test type curves and pressure fields are obtained and analyzed.

Sections of coronal dentin are made from human molars in three groups: young, mid-aged, and old patients. A nanoindentation test is conducted from regions near the pulp to the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ) to evaluate the load-depth indentation response and determine Young’s modulus and hardness. Based on the loading and unloading load-displacement curves in nanoindentation, a numerical model of plastic damage is used to study the plastic and the damage behaviors and the contribution to the degradation in the unloading stiffness. The experimental results show that Young’s modulus of the inner dentin is significantly lower than that of outer dentin in each age group. Compared with the young dentin, the old dentin has greater hardness and Young’s modulus with similar spatial variations. The magnitudes of the yield strength and the damage variable are also affected by aging and vary with spatial locations. In the same age group, the yield strength in inner dentin is lower than those in middle and outer dentin, more damage occurs with similar spatial variations, and the yield strength of young dentin is generally lower and more damage compared with those in both the mid-aged and old groups.","Xingguo Li1, Bingbing An2 & Dongsheng Zhang2,",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-015-1987-9,"dentin,mechanical property,nanoindentation,numerical simulation"

1193,Numerical and statistical approach for Casson-Maxwell nanofluid flow with Cattaneo-Christov theory,"The rheological features of an incompressible axi-symmetric Casson-Maxwell nanofluid flow between two stationary disks are examined. The lower permeable disk is located at z = −a, while the upper disk is placed at z = a. Both the disks are porous and subjected to uniform injection. The fluid properties such as thermal conductivity vary with temperature. The Cattaneo-Christov thermal expression is implemented along with the Buongiorno nanofluid theory. By operating the similarity functions, the reduced form of the fluid model in terms of ordinary differential equations is obtained and solved by the bvp4c numerical technique. The physical quantities are demonstrated graphically on the velocity and temperature fields. Three-dimensional flow arrangements and two-dimensional contour patterns against several dimensionless variables are also sketched. The numerical values of the local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers for various quantities are presented in tabular set-up. The intensity of the linear relationship between the Nusselt and Sherwood numbers is assessed through Pearson’s product-moment correlation technique. The statistical implication of the linear association between variables is also examined by the t-test statistic approach.","T. Mushtaq1, A. Rauf2, S. A. Shehzad2, F. Mustafa2, M. Hanif1 & …Z.

We prove that strict local minima of the control problem can be approximated uniformly by local minima of discrete control problems and we also get an estimate of the rate of this convergence.

This solution can be thought as the marginal pdf of the stochastic process called the generalized grey Brownian motion (ggBm). The ggBm includes some well-known stochastic processes: Brownian motion, fractional Brownian motion, and grey Brownian motion. To obtain a convergent numerical scheme we transform the fractional diffusion equation into its weak form and apply the discretization of the Erdélyi–Kober fractional derivative. We prove the stability of the solution of the semi-discrete problem and its convergence to the exact solution. Due to the singularity in the time term appearing in the main equation, the proposed method converges slower than first order. Finally, we provide a numerical analysis of the full-discrete problem using orthogonal expansion in terms of Hermite functions.","Łukasz Płociniczak1 & Mateusz Świtała

In this paper, we present a proficient collocation method based on cubic trigonometric B-Splines (CuTBSs) for time-fractional diffusion equations (TFDEs). The methodology involves discretization of the Caputo time-fractional derivatives using the typical finite difference scheme with space derivatives approximated using CuTBSs. A stability analysis is performed to establish that the errors do not magnify. A convergence analysis is also performed The numerical solution is obtained as a piecewise sufficiently smooth continuous curve, so that the solution can be approximated at any point in the given domain.

1203,A mathematical model and numerical estimation of setting stresses in polymer composites molded under hydrostatic pressure,"The effect of compression molding (i.e. molding under hydrostatic pressure) on the magnitude and distribution of setting stresses in particle-reinforced polymer composites is investigated using the finite element method. Models based on fairly random arrangements of the reinforcing particles are used, with different particle size gradations, as well as different aggregate-to-resin ratios. An analytical expression of the maximum setting stresses in these composites is introduced. A non-linear constrained optimization technique is used to obtain the mathematical model parameters which aid in a reasonable numerical estimation of the maximum setting stresses in real systems. The numerical results show that externally applied hydrostatic pressure helps diminish some of the local setting stresses. However, this relief becomes insignificant at the interface between aggregate particles and the resin domains where local setting stresses are maximum. This indicates that the practice of compression molding does not have a significant effect in reducing local setting stresses in ordinary polymer concrele systems.","A. M. Boriek1, A. S.

In this study we use a fourth-order finite-difference method supplemented by special two-way artificial boundary conditions (ABCs) to solve the NLH as a true boundary value problem.

1205,Special boundedness properties in numerical initial value problems,"For Runge-Kutta methods, linear multistep methods and other classes of general linear methods much attention has been paid in the literature to important nonlinear stability properties known as total-variation-diminishing (TVD), strong stability preserving (SSP) and monotonicity. Stepsize conditions guaranteeing these properties were studied by Shu and Osher (J. Comput. Phys. 77:439–471, 1988) and in numerous subsequent papers. Unfortunately, for many useful methods it has turned out that these properties do not hold. For this reason attention has been paid in the recent literature to the related and more general properties called total-variation-bounded (TVB) and boundedness.In the present paper we focus on stepsize conditions guaranteeing boundedness properties of a special type. These boundedness properties are optimal, and distinguish themselves also from earlier boundedness results by being relevant to sublinear functionals, discrete maximum principles and preservation of nonnegativity. Moreover, the corresponding stepsize conditions are more easily verified in practical situations than the conditions for general boundedness given thus far in the literature.The theoretical results are illustrated by application to the two-step Adams-Bashforth method and a class of two-stage multistep methods.","W.

1208,Numerical comparison of classical and permutation statistical hypothesis testing methods,"The article is devoted to the classical problem of statistical hypothesis testing for the equality of two distributions. For normal distributions, Student’s test is optimal in many senses. However, in practice, distributions to be compared are often not normal and, generally speaking, unknown. When nothing is known about the distributions to be compared, one usually applies the nonparametric Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to solve this problem. In the present paper, methods are considered that are based on permutations and, in recent years, have attracted interest for their simplicity, universality, and relatively high efficiency. Methods of stochastic simulation are applied to the comparative analysis of the power of a few permutation tests and classical methods (such as the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Student’s test, and the Mann–Whitney test) for a wide class of distribution functions. Normal distributions, Cauchy distributions, and their mixtures, as well as exponential, Weibull, Fisher’s, and Student’s distributions are considered. It is established that, for many typical distributions, the permutation method based on the sum of the absolute values of differences is the most powerful one. The advantage of this method over other ones is especially large when one compares symmetric distributions with the same centers. Thus, this permutation method can be recommended for application in cases when the distributions to be compared are different from normal ones.","V. B. Melas1, D. I. Sal’nikov1 & A. O.

Depending upon the choice of the weight parameter, the scheme is automatically transformed fromthe backward Euler scheme to amonotone hybrid scheme. Three kinds of nonuniform grids are considered, especially the standard Shishkin mesh, the Bakhavalov–Shishkinmesh and the adaptive grid. Themethods are shown to be uniformly convergent with respect to the perturbation parameter for all three types of meshes. The rate of convergence is of first order for the backward Euler scheme and second order for themonotone hybrid scheme. Furthermore, the proposed method is extended to a parameterized problem with mixed type boundary conditions and is shown to be uniformly convergent.

1211,Numerical algorithms for multidimensional time-fractional wave equation of distributed-order with a nonlinear source term,"Fractional differential equations (FDEs) of distributed-order are important in depicting the models where the order of differentiation distributes over a certain range. Numerically solving this kind of FDEs requires not only discretizations of the temporal and spatial derivatives, but also approximation of the distributed-order integral, which brings much more difficulty. In this paper, based on the mid-point quadrature rule and composite two-point Gauss–Legendre quadrature rule, two finite difference schemes are established. Different from the previous works, which concerned only one- or two-dimensional problems with linear source terms, time-fractional wave equations of distributed-order whose source term is nonlinear in two and even three dimensions are considered. In addition, to improve the computational efficiency, the technique of alternating direction implicit (ADI) decomposition is also adopted. The unique solvability of the difference scheme is discussed, and the unconditional stability and convergence are analyzed. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithms for both the two- and three-dimensional cases.","Jiahui Hu1,2, Jungang Wang1 & Yufeng Nie",Advances in Difference Equations,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13662-018-1817-2,"35R11,65M06,65M12"

1214,"Weighted Non-linear Compact Schemes for the Direct Numerical Simulation of Compressible, Turbulent Flows","A new class of compact-reconstruction weighted essentially non-oscillatory (CRWENO) schemes were introduced (Ghosh and Baeder in SIAM J Sci Comput 34(3): A1678–A1706, 2012) with high spectral resolution and essentially non-oscillatory behavior across discontinuities. The CRWENO schemes use solution-dependent weights to combine lower-order compact interpolation schemes and yield a high-order compact scheme for smooth solutions and a non-oscillatory compact scheme near discontinuities. The new schemes result in lower absolute errors, and improved resolution of discontinuities and smaller length scales, compared to the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme of the same order of convergence. Several improvements to the smoothness-dependent weights, proposed in the literature in the context of the WENO schemes, address the drawbacks of the original formulation. This paper explores these improvements in the context of the CRWENO schemes and compares the different formulations of the non-linear weights for flow problems with small length scales as well as discontinuities. Simplified one- and two-dimensional inviscid flow problems are solved to demonstrate the numerical properties of the CRWENO schemes and its different formulations. Canonical turbulent flow problems—the decay of isotropic turbulence and the shock-turbulence interaction—are solved to assess the performance of the schemes for the direct numerical simulation of compressible, turbulent flows.",Debojyoti Ghosh1 nAff2 & James D.

1219,Adaptive Numerical Treatment of Elliptic Systems on Manifolds,"Adaptive multilevel finite element methods are developed and analyzed for certain elliptic systems arising in geometric analysis and general relativity. This class of nonlinear elliptic systems of tensor equations on manifolds is first reviewed, and then adaptive multilevel finite element methods for approximating solutions to this class of problems are considered in some detail. Two a posteriori error indicators are derived, based on local residuals and on global linearized adjoint or dual problems. The design of Manifold Code (MC) is then discussed; MC is an adaptive multilevel finite element software package for 2- and 3-manifolds developed over several years at Caltech and UC San Diego. It employs a posteriori error estimation, adaptive simplex subdivision, unstructured algebraic multilevel methods, global inexact Newton methods, and numerical continuation methods for the numerical solution of nonlinear covariant elliptic systems on 2- and 3-manifolds. Some of the more interesting features of MC are described in detail, including some new ideas for topology and geometry representation in simplex meshes, and an unusual partition of unity-based method for exploiting parallel computers. A short example is then given which involves the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints in the Einstein equations, a representative nonlinear 4-component covariant elliptic system on a Riemannian 3-manifold which arises in general relativity. A number of operator properties and solvability results recently established in [55] are first summarized, making possible two quasi-optimal a priori error estimates for Galerkin approximations which are then derived. These two results complete the theoretical framework for effective use of adaptive multilevel finite element methods. A sample calculation using the MC software is then presented; more detailed examples using MC for this application may be found in [26].",M.

1224,"Numerical methods for finding multiple eigenvalues of matrices depending on parameters
","Let \(A(\alpha,\lambda)\) be a square matrix dependent on parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\lambda\), of which we choose \(\lambda\) as the eigenvalue parameter. Many computational problems are equivalent to finding a point \((\alpha^*,\lambda^*)\) such that \(A(\alpha,\lambda)\) has a multiple eigenvalue \(\lambda=\lambda^*\) at \(\alpha=\alpha^*\). An incomplete \(QR\) decomposition of a matrix dependent on several parameters is proposed. Based on the developed theory two new algorithms are presented for computing multiple eigenvalues of \(A(\alpha, \lambda)\) with geometric multiplicity \(m\ge 2\). A third algorithm is designed for the computation of multiple eigenvalues with geometric multiplicity \(m=1\) but which also appears to have local quadratic convergence to semi-simple eigenvalues. Convergence analyses of these methods are given. Several numerical examples are presented which illustrate the behaviour and applications of our methods.

1225,Numerical approaches to the functional distribution of anomalous diffusion with both traps and flights,"The functional distributions of particle trajectories have wide applications. This paper focuses on providing effective computation methods for the models, which characterize the distribution of the functionals of the paths of anomalous diffusion with both traps and flights. Two kinds of discretization schemes are proposed for the time fractional substantial derivatives. The Galerkin method with interval spline scaling bases is used for the space approximation; compared with the usual finite element or spectral polynomial bases, the spline scaling bases have the advantages of keeping the Toeplitz structure of the stiffness matrix, and being easy to generate the matrix elements and to perform preconditioning. The rigorous stability analyses for both the semi and the full discrete schemes are skillfully developed. Under the assumptions of the regularity of the exact solution, the convergence of the provided schemes is also theoretically proved and numerically verified. Moreover, the theoretical background of the selected basis function and the implementation details of the algorithms involved are described in detail.",Zhijiang Zhang1 & Weihua Deng,Advances in Computational Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-016-9503-y,"Functional distribution,Fractional substantial derivative,Spline scaling bases,PI and FBDF schemes"

1227,Numerical treatment of nonlinear model of virus propagation in computer networks: an innovative evolutionary Padé approximation scheme,"This work proposes a novel mesh free evolutionary Padé approximation (EPA) framework for obtaining closed form numerical solution of a nonlinear dynamical continuous model of virus propagation in computer networks. The proposed computational architecture of EPA scheme assimilates a Padé approximation to transform the underlying nonlinear model to an equivalent optimization problem. Initial conditions, dynamical positivity and boundedness are dealt with as problem constraints and are handled through penalty function approach. Differential evolution is employed to obtain closed form numerical solution of the model by solving the developed optimization problem. The numerical results of EPA are compared with finite difference schemes like fourth order Runge–Kutta (RK-4), ODE45 and Euler methods. Contrary to these standard methods, the proposed EPA scheme is independent of the choice of step lengths and unconditionally converges to true steady state points. An error analysis based on residuals witnesses that the convergence speed of EPA is higher than a globally convergent non-standard finite difference (NSFD) scheme for smaller as well as larger time steps.","Javaid Ali1, Muhammad Saeed1, Muhammad Rafiq2 & …Shaukat Iqbal",Advances in Difference Equations,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13662-018-1672-1,"Nonlinear model,Evolutionary computing,Padé approximation,Optimization"

1245,A numerical study of the convergence properties of ENO schemes,"We report numerical results obtained with finite difference ENO schemes for the model problem of the linear convection equation with periodic boundary conditions. For the test function sin(x), the spatial and temporal errors decrease at the rate expected from the order of local truncation errors as the discretization is refined. If we take sin4(x) as our test function, however, we find that the numerical solution does not converge uniformly and that an improved discretization can result in larger errors. This difficulty is traced back to the linear stability characteristics of the individual stencils employed by the ENO algorithm. If we modify the algorithm to prevent the use of linearly unstable stencils, the proper rate of convergence is reestablished. The way toward recovering the correct order of accuracy of ENO schemes appears to involve a combination of fixed stencils in smooth regions and ENO stencils in regions of strong gradients —a concept that is developed in detail in a companion paper by Shu (this issue, 1990).",A.

1256,Combined grid-characteristic method for the numerical solution of three-dimensional dynamical elastoplastic problems,"A combined method blending the advantages of smoothed particles hydrodynamics (SPH) and the grid-characteristic method (GCM) is proposed for simulating elastoplastic bodies. Various grid methods, including the GCM, have long been used for the numerical simulation of elastoplastic media. This method applies to the simulation of wave processes in elastic media, including elastic impacts, in which case an advantage is the use of moving tetrahedral meshes. Additionally, fracture processes can be simulated by applying various fracture criteria. However, this is a technically complicated task with the accuracy of the results degrading due to the continual updating of the grid. A more suitable approach to the simulation of processes involving substantial fractures and deformations is based on SPH, which is a meshless method. However, this method also has shortcomings: it produces spurious modes, and the simulation of oscillations requires particle refinement. Thus, two families of methods are available that are optimal as applied to two different groups of problems. However, a realworld problem can frequently be a mixed one, which requires a substantial tradeoff in the numerical methods applied. Aimed at solving such problems, a combined GCM-SPH method is developed that blends the advantages of two constituting techniques and partially eliminates their shortcomings.","A. V. Vasyukov1, A. S.

1264,Pseudo Numerical Ranges and Spectral Enclosures,"We introduce the new concepts of pseudo numerical range for operator functions and families of sesquilinear forms as well as the pseudo block numerical range for \(n\!\times \! n\) operator matrix functions. While these notions are new even in the bounded case, we cover operator polynomials with unbounded coefficients, unbounded holomorphic form families of type (a) and associated operator families of type (B). Our main results include spectral inclusion properties of pseudo numerical ranges and pseudo block numerical ranges. For diagonally dominant and off-diagonally dominant operator matrices they allow us to prove spectral enclosures in terms of the pseudo numerical ranges of Schur complements that no longer require dominance order 0 and not even \(<\!1\). As an application, we establish a new type of spectral bounds for linearly damped wave equations with possibly unbounded and/or singular damping.","Borbala Gerhat1 & Christiane Tretter

Without any alterations in this technique, it is proposed that the estimation of the unknown function of the integral equation is further achieved by using the Hermite interpolation formula instead of the Lagrange interpolation formula. Alternatively, the unknown function can be estimated from the error term of the numerical integration rule used for Cauchy-type integrals. Both these techniques permit a significant increase in the accuracy of the numerical results obtained with an insignificant increase in the additional computations required and no change in the system of linear equations solved.

Along the course of a renal tubule, cell type may change abruptly, resulting in abrupt changes in the physical characteristics and transmural transport properties of the tubule. A mathematical model that faithfully represents these abrupt changes will have jump discontinuities in model parameters. Without proper treatment, such discontinuities may cause unrealistic transmural fluxes and introduce suboptimal spatial convergence in the numerical solution to the model equations. In this study, we show how to treat discontinuous parameters in the context of a previously developed numerical method that is based on the semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit method and Newton's method.

1301,A boundary preserving numerical algorithm for the Wright-Fisher model with mutation,"The Wright-Fisher model is an Itô stochastic differential equation that was originally introduced to model genetic drift within finite populations and has recently been used as an approximation to ion channel dynamics within cardiac and neuronal cells. While analytic solutions to this equation remain within the interval [0,1], current numerical methods are unable to preserve such boundaries in the approximation. We present a new numerical method that guarantees approximations to a form of Wright-Fisher model, which includes mutation, remain within [0,1] for all time with probability one. Strong convergence of the method is proved and numerical experiments suggest that this new scheme converges with strong order 1/2. Extending this method to a multidimensional case, numerical tests suggest that the algorithm still converges strongly with order 1/2. Finally, numerical solutions obtained using this new method are compared to those obtained using the Euler-Maruyama method where the Wiener increment is resampled to ensure solutions remain within [0,1].","C.

We have obtained the optimal order of convergence, \({\mathcal{O}(h^{2k})}\), of the error in the computed functional, when the integrals in the stiffness matrix and the load vector are computed with a quadrature rule of algebraic precision 2k − 1. However, this result was obtained under an increased regularity assumption on the data, which is more than required to obtain the optimal order of convergence of the energy norm of the error in the finite element solution with quadrature. We have obtained a lower bound of the error in the computed functional for a particular problem, which indicates the necessity of the increased regularity requirement of the data. Numerical experiments have been presented indicating that over-integration may be necessary to accurately approximate the functional, when the data lack the increased regularity.","Ivo Babuška1, Uday Banerjee2 & Hengguang Li",Numerische Mathematik,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-010-0335-2,"65N15,65N30"

1315,An adaptive Newton algorithm based on numerical inversion: Regularization as postconditioner,"We examine a class of approximate inversion processes, satisfying estimates similar to those defined by finite element or truncated spectral approximations; these are to be used as approximate right inverses for Newton iteration methods. When viewed at the operator level, these approximations introduce a defect, or “loss of derivatives”, of order one or more. Regularization is introduced as a form of defect correction. A superlinearly convergent, approximate Newton iteration is thereby obtained by using the numerical inversion adaptively, i.e., with spectral or grid parameters correlated to the magnitude of the current residual in an intermediate norm defined by the defect. This adaptive choice makes possible ascribing an order to the convergent process, and this is identified as essentially optimal for elliptic problems, relative to complexity. The design of the algorithm involves multi-parameter selection, thereby opening up interesting avenues for elliptic problems, relative to complexity. This applies also to the regularization which may be carried out in the Fourier transform space, and is band-limited in the language of Whittaker-Shannon sampling theory. The norms employed in the analysis are of Hölder space type; the iteration is an adaptation of Nash-Moser interation; and, the complexity studies use Vituškin's theory of information processing.

1316,Comparison of Dissipation and Dispersion Properties of Compact Difference Schemes for the Numerical Solution of the Advection Equation,"AbstractThe dissipation and dispersion properties of the Hermite characteristic scheme intended for solving the one-dimensional advection equation are examined. The scheme is based on Hermite interpolation using not only the nodal values of the function, but also the nodal values of its spatial derivative. The derivatives at a new time step are computed so as to ensure the correct redistribution of the input fluxes over the output faces. Note that the scheme is constructed within a single cell, so it belongs to the class of bicompact schemes. The derivatives at a new time level are reconstructed using an integral average and the Euler–Maclaurin formula. The scheme is compared with modern conservative schemes, such as the bicompact Rogov scheme and the Goloviznin–Chetverushkin scheme. It is shown that the Hermite characteristic scheme has low dissipation and ultralow dispersion as compared with schemes of the same class. The dispersion of the Hermite characteristic scheme is lower than that of the semidiscrete bicompact Rogov scheme. In turn, the latter scheme with time approximation based on the trapezoidal rule has zero dissipation. Similar ideas of using characteristic schemes with an additional algorithm ensuring conservativeness are used in the Goloviznin–Chetverushkin scheme, which is the simplest in implementation. The schemes used for comparison have a compact stencil and similar technics used for closing difference schemes.",E. N. Aristova1 & G. O.

Finally, numerical experiments are presented to test the convergence order in the temporal and spatial direction, respectively. To precisely demonstrate the computational efficiency of the derived high-order numerical method, the maximum norm error and the CPU time are measured in contrast with the second-order finite difference scheme for the same temporal grid size.

1323,Mathematical models for tumour angiogenesis: Numerical simulations and nonlinear wave solutions,"To ensure its sustained growth, a tumour may secrete chemical compounds which cause neighbouring capillaries to form sprouts which then migrate towards it, furnishing the tumour with an increased supply of nutrients. In this paper a mathematical model is presented which describes the migration of capillary sprouts in response to a chemoattractant field set up by a tumour-released angiogenic factor, sometimes termed a tumour angiogenesis factor (TAF). The resulting model admits travelling wave solutions which correspond either to successful neovascularization of the tumour or failure of the tumour to secure a vascular network, and which exhibit many of the characteristic features of angiogenesis. For example, the increasing speed of the vascular front, and the evolution of an increasingly developed vascular network behind the leading capillary tip front (the brush-border effect) are both discernible from the numerical simulations. Through the development and analysis of a simplified caricature model, valuable insight is gained into how the balance between chemotaxis, tip proliferation and tip death affects the tumour's ability to induce a vascular response from neighbouring blood vessels. In particular, it is possible to define the success of angiogenesis in terms of known parameters, thereby providing a potential framework for assessing the viability of tumour neovascularization in terms of measurable quantities.",H.

The simulations follow the motion of individual red blood cells as they enter the network from an arterial entrance point with a specified tube hematocrit, while simultaneously updating the nodal capillary pressures. Poiseuille’s law is used to describe flow in the capillary segments with an effective viscosity that depends on the number of cells residing inside each segment. The relative apparent viscosity is available from previous computational studies of individual red blood cell motion. Simulations are performed for a tree-like capillary network consisting of bifurcating segments. The results reveal that the probability of directional cell motion at a bifurcation (phase separation) may have an important effect on the statistical measures of the cell residence time and scattering of the tube hematocrit across the network. Blood cells act as regulators of the flow rate through the network branches by increasing the effective viscosity when the flow rate is high and decreasing the effective viscosity when the flow rate is low. Comparison with simulations based on conventional models of blood flow regarded as a continuum indicates that the latter underestimates the variance of the hematocrit across the vascular tree.",C.

Accordingly, this study proposes a new and effective hybrid algorithm based on quantum computing theory to solve the MIOCP.

The hybrid QA/DEQACA algorithm integrates the strengths of such algorithms to better balance the exploration and exploitation abilities.

Impacts of heat generation/absorption and destructive/generative chemical reactions are considered. Use of proper variables leads to a system of non-linear dimensionless expressions. Velocity, temperature and concentration profiles are achieved through a finite difference based algorithm with a successive over-relaxation (SOR) method. Emerging dimensionless quantities are described with graphs and tables. The temperature and concentration profiles decay due to enhancement in fluid parameters and Deborah numbers.","A. Rauf1,2, Z.

1334,Construction of weak solutions to compressible Navier–Stokes equations with general inflow/outflow boundary conditions via a numerical approximation,"The construction of weak solutions to compressible Navier–Stokes equations via a numerical method (including a rigorous proof of the convergence) is in a short supply, and so far, available only for one sole numerical scheme suggested in Karper (Numer Math, 125(3):441–510, 2013) for the no slip boundary conditions and the isentropic pressure with adiabatic coefficient \(\gamma >3\). Here we consider the same problem for the general non zero inflow–outflow boundary conditions, which is definitely more appropriate setting from the point of view of applications, but which is essentially more involved as far as the existence of weak solutions is concerned. There is a few recent proofs of existence of weak solutions in this setting, but none of them is performed via a numerical method. The goal of this paper is to fill this gap. The existence of weak solutions on the continuous level requires several tools of functional and harmonic analysis and differential geometry whose numerical counterparts are not known. Our main strategy therefore consists in rewriting of the numerical scheme in its variational form modulo remainders and to apply and/or to adapt to the new variational formulation the tools developed in the theoretical analysis. In addition to the result, which is new, the synergy between numerical and theoretical analysis is the main originality of the present paper.",Young-Sam Kwon1 & Antonin Novotný,Numerische Mathematik,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-021-01237-0,"35Q30,65N12,65N30,76N10,76N15,76M10,76M12"
1335,Fast numerical upscaling of heat equation for fibrous materials,"We are interested in numerical methods for computing the effective heat conductivities of fibrous insulation materials, such as glass or mineral wool, characterized by low solid volume fractions and high contrasts, i.e., high ratios between the thermal conductivities of the fibers and the surrounding air. We consider a fast numerical method for solving some auxiliary cell problems appearing in this upscaling procedure. The auxiliary problems are boundary value problems of the steady-state heat equation in a representative elementary volume occupied by fibers and air. We make a simplification by replacing these problems with appropriate boundary value problems in the domain occupied by the fibers only. Finally, the obtained problems are further simplified by taking advantage of the slender shape of the fibers and assuming that they form a network. A discretization on the graph defined by the fibers is presented and error estimates are provided. The resulting algorithm is discussed and the accuracy and the performance of the method are illusrated on a number of numerical experiments.","Oleg Iliev1, Raytcho Lazarov2 & Joerg Willems",Computing and Visualization in Science,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00791-010-0144-2,"Effective heat conductivity,Numerical upscaling,Fibrous materials"

RBC and vesicles are viscoelastic bodies consisting of a deformable elastic membrane enclosing an incompressible fluid. We provide an extension of the finite element immersed boundary method by Boffi and Gastaldi (Comput Struct 81:491–501, 2003), Boffi et al. (Math Mod Meth Appl Sci 17:1479–1505, 2007), Boffi et al. (Comput Struct 85:775–783, 2007) based on a model for the membrane that additionally accounts for bending energy and also consider inflow/outflow conditions for the external fluid flow. The stability analysis requires both the approximation of the membrane by cubic splines (instead of linear splines without bending energy) and an upper bound on the inflow velocity. In the fully discrete case, the resulting CFL-type condition on the time step size is also more restrictive. We perform numerical simulations for various scenarios including the tank treading motion of vesicles in microchannels, the behavior of ‘healthy’ and ‘sick’ RBC which differ by their stiffness, and the motion of RBC through thin capillaries. The simulation results are in very good agreement with experimentally available data.","Thomas Franke1, Ronald H. W.

We derive a formal asymptotic limit of the two-dimensional anisotropic problem, in the case where the anisotropy ratio goes to infinity.

1350,Theoretical and numerical comparison of relaxation methods for mathematical programs with complementarity constraints,"Mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPECs) are difficult optimization problems whose feasible sets do not satisfy most of the standard constraint qualifications. Hence MPECs cause difficulties both from a theoretical and a numerical point of view. As a consequence, a number of MPEC-tailored solution methods have been suggested during the last decade which are known to converge under suitable assumptions. Among these MPEC-tailored solution schemes, the relaxation methods are certainly one of the most prominent class of solution methods. Several different relaxation schemes are available in the meantime, and the aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical and numerical comparison of these schemes. More precisely, in the theoretical part, we improve the convergence theorems of several existing relaxation methods. There, we also take a closer look at the properties of the feasible sets of the relaxed problems and show which standard constraint qualifications are satisfied for these relaxed problems. Finally, the numerical comparison is based on the MacMPEC test problem collection.","Tim Hoheisel1, Christian Kanzow1 & Alexandra Schwartz",Mathematical Programming,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-011-0488-5,"Mathematical programs with complementarity constraints,Relaxation method,Constraint qualification,Global convergence,Performance profiles"

Therefore, there is a necessity of a numerical scheme for the solution of these problems. In this paper, we propose an efficient Chebyshev collocation scheme to solve a special kind of two-point fractional Bagley–Torvik equation considering the fractional derivative in the Caputo sense. The given problem is successfully reduced into the system of algebraic equations with a particular choice of collocation points. The error analysis and convergence criteria of the present scheme are also discussed. We get good results in the sense that just a few terms of basis functions (SCPFK) are required. The given scheme is simple and powerful in use to solve such problems since boundary conditions are taken into account automatically.

1352,On numerical cubatures of singular surface integrals in boundary element methods,"We present and analyze methods for the accurate and efficient evaluation of weakly, Cauchy and hypersingular integrals over piecewise analytic curved surfaces in ℝ3.The class of admissible integrands includes all kernels arising in the numerical solution of elliptic boundary value problems in three-dimensional domains by the boundary integral equation method. The possibly not absolutely integrable kernels of boundary integral operators in local coordinates are pseudohomogeneous with analytic characteristics depending on the local geometry of the surface at the source point. This rules out weighted quadrature approaches with a fixed singular weight.For weakly singular integrals it is shown that Duffy's triangular coordinates leadalways to a removal of the kernel singularity. Also asymptotic estimates of the integration error are provided as the size of the boundary element patch tends to zero. These are based on the Rabinowitz-Richter estimates in connection with an asymptotic estimate of domains of analyticity in ℂ2.It is further shown that the modified extrapolation approach due to Lyness is in the weakly singular case always applicable. Corresponding error and asymptotic work estimates are presented.For the weakly singular as well as for Cauchy and hypersingular integrals which e.g. arise in the study of crack problems we analyze a family of product integration rules in local polar coordinates. These rules are hierarchically constructed from “finite part” integration formulas in radial and Gaussian formulas in angular direction. Again, we show how the Rabinowitz-Richter estimates can be applied providing asymptotic error estimates in terms of orders of the boundary element size.",C. Schwab1 & W. L.

1353,Numerical Methods and Nature,In many numerical procedures one wishes to improve the basic approach either to improve efficiency or else to improve accuracy. Frequently this is based on an analysis of the properties of the discrete system being solved. Using a linear algebra approach one then improves the algorithm. We review methods that instead use a continuous analysis and properties of the differential equation rather than the algebraic system. We shall see that frequently one wishes to develop methods that destroy the physical significance of intermediate results. We present cases where this procedure works and others where it fails.

The conditions on the coefficients of a method to belong to these families turn out to be essentially weaker than the usual algebraic stability condition which appears in connection with the B-stability and convergence for stiff nonlinear systems. Thus there are important RK methods which are not algebraically stable but, according to our theory, they are suitable for the numerical integration of semilinear problems.This paper also extends previous results of Burrage, Hundsdorfer and Verwer on the optimal convergence of implicit Runge-Kutta methods for stiff semilinear systems with a constant coefficients linear part.","M.

This method combines a fully-conservative finite-difference approximation on a finite domain around the airfoil with an approximate asymptotic solution outside this finite domain. The errors are analyzed as a function of the accuracy of the approximate asymptotic expansion, of the distance to the airfoil of the far-field boundary of the finite domain and of the mesh size. The numerical experiments show that, for a given desired accuracy level, large reduction in grid sizes are possible, if the usual far-field asymptotic approximation (uniform flow plus first-order perturbation by a circulation vortex at infinity) is augmented by only a few extra terms in the approximate asymptotic far-field solution. In this way, considerable numerical efficiency improvements can be realized. It is expected that this conclusion can be generalized to many other applications where computations on infinite domains are performed.","F. W. Wubs1 nAff2, J. W. Boerstoel1 & A. J.

1368,Invasive behaviour under competition via a free boundary model: a numerical approach,"What will happen when two invasive species are competing and invading the environment at the same time? In this paper, we try to find all the possible scenarios in such a situation based on the diffusive Lotka-Volterra competition system with free boundaries. In a recent work, Du and Wu (Calc Var Partial Differ Equ, 57(2):52, 2018) considered a weak-strong competition case of this model (with spherical symmetry) and theoretically proved the existence of a “chase-and-run coexistence” phenomenon, for certain parameter ranges when the initial functions are chosen properly. Here we use a numerical approach to extend the theoretical research of Du and Wu (Calc Var Partial Differ Equ, 57(2):52, 2018) in several directions. Firstly, we examine how the longtime dynamics of the model changes as the initial functions are varied, and the simulation results suggest that there are four possible longtime profiles of the dynamics, with the chase-and-run coexistence the only possible profile when both species invade successfully. Secondly, we show through numerical experiments that the basic features of the model appear to be retained when the environment is perturbed by periodic variation in time. Thirdly, our numerical analysis suggests that in two space dimensions the population range and the spatial population distribution of the successful invader tend to become more and more circular as time increases no matter what geometrical shape the initial population range possesses. Our numerical simulations cover the one space dimension case, and two space dimension case with or without spherical symmetry. The numerical methods here are based on that of Liu et al. (Mathematics, 6(5):72, 2018, Int J Comput Math, 97(5): 959–979, 2020). In the two space dimension case without radial symmetry, the level set method is used, while the front tracking method is used for the remaining cases. We hope the numerical observations in this paper can provide further insights to the biological invasion problem, and also to future theoretical investigations. More importantly, we hope the numerical analysis may reach more biologically oriented experts and inspire applications of some refined versions of the model tailored to specific real world biological invasion problems.","Kamruzzaman Khan

Hence, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the distinguishability of the input-output mappings \(\Phi[\cdot]\) and \(\Psi[\cdot]\). Moreover, the measured output data \(f(t)\) and \(h(t)\) can be determined analytically by a series representation, which implies that the input-output mappings \(\Phi[\cdot]:\mathcal{K}\rightarrow C^{1}[0,T]\) and \(\Psi[\cdot]:\mathcal{K}\rightarrow C[0,T]\) can be described explicitly, where \(\Phi[r]=k(x)u_{x}(x,t;r)|_{x=0}\) and \(\Psi [r]=u(x,t;r)|_{x=1}\).

In a second part we instantiate this framework to a particular cooperation scheme, where propagation is associated to pruning operators implementing interval algorithms enclosing the possible solutions of constraint systems, whereas symbolic methods are mainly devoted to generate redundant constraints. When carefully chosen, it is well known that the addition of redundant constraint drastically improve the performances of systems based on local consistency (e.g. Prolog IV or Newton).

In fact, we use the HDG method for discretizing the space variable and the backward Euler explicit method for the time variable. To linearize the system, the time-lagging approach is also applied. The numerical stability of the method in the sense of the \(L_2\) norm is proved using the energy method under certain assumptions on the stabilization parameters for periodic or homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Numerical experiments confirm that the HDG method is capable of solving the system efficiently. It is observed that the best possible rate of convergence is achieved by the HDG method. Also, it is being illustrated numerically that the corresponding conservation laws are satisfied for the approximate solutions of the Ito-type coupled KdV system. Thanks to the numerical experiments, it is verified that the HDG method could be more efficient than the LDG method for solving some Ito-type coupled KdV systems by comparing the corresponding computational costs and orders of convergence.","Shima Baharlouei1, Reza Mokhtari

A full membrane model and the nonlinear theory of hyperelastic materials are used for describing the tube walls. The Riemann problem is solved, and its solutions confirm the theory of reversible discontinuity structures. Dispersion of short waves for such equations vanishes; for this reason, dissipative discontinuity structures can be included. The equations under examination are complicated due to which general numerical methods are developed. Application of the centered three-layer cross-type scheme and schemes based on the approximation of time derivatives using the Runge–Kutta method of various orders is considered. A technology for correcting schemes based on the Runge–Kutta method by adding dissipative terms is developed. In the scalar case, the third- and fourth-order methods do not require correction.

The PDE formulation of these models leads to analytical solutions only under very strong simplifications. For more general models the option price needs to be evaluated by numerical techniques. First, based on an ideal pure diffusion process for two risky asset prices with an additional path-dependent variable for continuous arithmetic average, we present a general form of PDE for pricing of Asian option contracts on two assets. Further, we focus only on one subclass—Asian options with floating strike—and introduce the concept of the dimensionality reduction with respect to the payoff leading to PDE with two spatial variables.

We predict the existence of a point of “geometrical phase transition” u0 = ln(1/2k2b); it corresponds to the transition from one class of trajectories to another that qualitatively differs from the initial class. Numerical simulation of the motion in a neighborhood of points of geometric phase transitions is performed. We prove that in the absence of friction forces, the minimization problem for the motion time for any motion along a curvilinear trough under the action of the gravity force can always be reduced to the brachistochrone problem and can be solved without involving methods of calculus of variation, only by general dynamical laws. We find a solution to the classical Bernoulli problem under the condition that the length of the trajectory is fixed. We show that under this isoperimetric condition, the class of trajectories differs from the classical brachistochrone.

Solving the equations via a novel use of the finite element method on a moving mesh, we show how a reaction-diffusion model can mimic a number of different ligament growth patterns with modest changes in the parameters. Our results imply the existence of a common mode of ligament pattern formation throughout the Arcoida. Consequently, arcoids that share a particular pattern cannot be assumed, on this basis alone, to share an immediate common ancestry. Strikingly different patterns within the set can easily be generated by the same developmental program. We further show how the model can be used to make quantitatively testable predictions with biological implications.","Anotida Madzvamuse1, Roger D. K. Thomas2, Philip K. Maini3 & …Andrew J.

1392,A numerical investigation of Brockett’s ensemble optimal control problems,"This paper is devoted to the numerical analysis of non-smooth ensemble optimal control problems governed by the Liouville (continuity) equation that have been originally proposed by R.W. Brockett with the purpose of determining an efficient and robust control strategy for dynamical systems. A numerical methodology for solving these problems is presented that is based on a non-smooth Lagrange optimization framework where the optimal controls are characterized as solutions to the related optimality systems. For this purpose, approximation and solution schemes are developed and analysed. Specifically, for the approximation of the Liouville model and its optimization adjoint, a combination of a Kurganov–Tadmor method, a Runge–Kutta scheme, and a Strang splitting method are discussed. The resulting optimality system is solved by a projected semi-smooth Krylov–Newton method. Results of numerical experiments are presented that successfully validate the proposed framework.","Jan Bartsch1, Alfio Borzì1, Francesco Fanelli2 & …Souvik Roy",Numerische Mathematik,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-021-01223-6,"35L03,49K20,49M15,65M08"

1395,Numerical simulation of the unsteady aerodynamic interaction of two plane airfoil cascades,A method for the calculation of unsteady aerodynamic interaction of two plane airfoil cascades that are in relative motion in a subsonic flow of ideal gas is developed. This interaction provides a two-dimensional approximation of the flow in a stage of an axial turbomachine. The method is based on the reduction of the problem to the calculation of the unsteady flow in a single interblade passage of each of the cascades. The calculation uses generalized space-time periodicity relations corresponding to the unsteady process of interest. The calculation is based on the direct numerical integration of the non-stationary gas dynamics equations with the use of the finite difference Godunov-Kolgan-Rodionov scheme of the second approximation order with respect to time and space. The calculation procedure includes the determination of the acoustic fields that are generated by the stage in the incident flow and in the flow behind it.

The error analysis is given when the true solution lies on appropriate Sobolev spaces defined on surfaces. The method only requires a set of scattered points on a given surface and an approximation to the surface normal vectors at these points.

This paper is based on our recent research on numerical pricing of path-dependent multi-asset options and extends these results also to the case of Asian options with fixed strike. First, we recall the three-dimensional backward parabolic PDE describing the evolution of European-style Asian option contracts on two assets, whose payoff depends on the difference of the strike price and the average value of the basket of two underlying assets during the life of the option. Further, a suitable transformation of variables respecting this complex form of a payoff function reduces the problem to a two-dimensional equation belonging to the class of convection-diffusion problems and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is applied to it in order to utilize its solving potentials. The whole procedure is accompanied with theoretical results and differences to the floating strike case are discussed. Finally, reference numerical experiments on real market data illustrate comprehensive empirical findings on Asian options.",Jiří Hozman1 & Tomáš Tichý,Applications of Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.21136/AM.2017.0176-17,"option pricing,discontinuous Galerkin method,Asian option,basket option,fixed strike"
1402,On the numerical solution of nonlinear integral equations on non-rectangular domains utilizing thin plate spline collocation method,"This article investigates an approximate scheme to solve nonlinear Fredholm integral equations of the second kind on non-rectangular domains. The integral equations considered in the current paper are considered together with either smooth or weakly singular kernels. The offered method utilizes thin plate splines as a basis in the discrete collocation method. We can regard thin plate splines as a type of the free shape parameter radial basis functions. These basis functions establish an accurate and stable technique to estimate an unknown function by using a set of scattered points on the solution domains. Since the thin plate splines have limited smoothness, the integrals appeared in the scheme cannot be estimated by classical integration rules. Therefore, we introduce a special precise quadrature formula on non-rectangular domains to compute these integrals. The proposed scheme does not require any mesh generations, so it is meshless and does not depend on the domain form. Error analysis is also provided for the method. The performance and convergence of the new approach are tested on four two-dimensional integral equations given on the wing, mushroom, pentagon and fish-like domains.","Pouria Assari

The aim of this paper is to present an implicit numerical scheme along with its error analysis to solve a fractional-order system of delay differential equations. The proposed method is an extension of the L1 numerical scheme and has the error estimate of \(O(h^2)\), where h denotes the step size. Further, we solve various non-trivial examples using the proposed method and compare the results with those obtained by some other established methods such as the fractional Adams method and the three-term new predictor–corrector method.

Hopf, saddle-node, homoclinic, codimension-two bifurcation points and chaotic behavior appeared in the system. Non-smooth such as sliding and stable pseudo equilibrium are also present when continuous systems are replaced by Fillipov systems.

Then, implicit and semi-implicit schemes are coupled to finite volumes space discretization and are compared for some classical problems relevant for magnetically confined plasmas.

1406,Numerical experiments with MALDI Imaging data,"This article does not present new mathematical results, it solely aims at discussing some numerical experiments with MALDI Imaging data. However, these experiments are based on and could not be done without the mathematical results obtained in the UNLocX project. They tackle two obstacles which presently prevent clinical routine applications of MALDI Imaging technology. In the last decade, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) has developed into a powerful bioanalytical imaging modality. MALDI imaging data consists of a set of mass spectra, which are measured at different locations of a flat tissue sample. Hence, this technology is capable of revealing the full metabolic structure of the sample under investigation. Sampling resolution as well as spectral resolution is constantly increasing, presently a conventional 2D MALDI Imaging data requires up to 100 GB per dataset. A major challenge towards routine applications of MALDI Imaging in pharmaceutical or medical workflows is the high computational cost for evaluating and visualizing the information content of MALDI imaging data. This becomes even more critical in the near future when considering cohorts or 3D applications. Due to its size and complexity MALDI Imaging constitutes a challenging test case for high performance signal processing. In this article we will apply concepts and algorithms, which were developed within the UNLocX project, to MALDI Imaging data. In particular we will discuss a suitable phase space model for such data and report on implementations of the resulting transform coders using GPU technology. Within the MALDI Imaging workflow this leads to an efficient baseline removal and peak picking. The final goal of data processing in MALDI Imaging is the discrimination of regions having different metabolic structures. We introduce and discuss so-called soft-segmentation maps which are obtained by non-negative matrix factorization incorporating sparsity constraints.","Jan Hendrik Kobarg1, Peter Maass1, Janina Oetjen1, Oren Tropp2, Eyal Hirsch2, Chen Sagiv2, Mohammad Golbabaee3 & …Pierre Vandergheynst",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-013-9325-0,"Imaging mass spectrometry,Dimensionality reduction"

In addition, a Crank–Nicolson scheme is presented and the corresponding error estimates are also established. Meanwhile, a compact ADI difference scheme for solving two-dimensional case is derived and the global convergence order of \(\mathcal{O }(\tau ^{3-\alpha }+h_1^4+h_2^4)\) is given. Then extension to the case with Robin boundary conditions is also discussed.

1415,Stable Numerical Solution for a Class of Structured Differential-Algebraic Equations by Linear Multistep Methods,"It is known that when we apply a linear multistep method to differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), usually the strict stability of the second characteristic polynomial is required for the zero stability. In this paper, we revisit the use of linear multistep discretizations for a class of structured strangeness-free DAEs. Both explicit and implicit linear multistep schemes can be used as underlying methods. When being applied to an appropriately reformulated form of the DAEs, the methods have the same convergent order and the same stability property as applied to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In addition, the strict stability of the second characteristic polynomial is no longer required. In particular, for a class of semi-linear DAEs, if the underlying linear multistep method is explicit, then the computational cost may be significantly reduced. Numerical experiments are given to confirm the advantages of the new discretization schemes.","Vu Hoang Linh

Gravitational data has a sensitivity to density perturbations that decays rapidly with depth in the Earth. Normal-mode data allows for more uniform resolution throughout the mantle. However, inversions based on either type of data suffer from non-uniqueness problems. Their joint inversion requires a weighting process to avoid a strong dominance of the gravitational data. Finally, an outlook on a sparse regularisation is given.","Paula Berkel1, Doreen Fischer1 & Volker Michel",GEM - International Journal on Geomathematics,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13137-010-0007-5,"Inverse problem,Regularisation,Tomography,Crust,Mantle,Inverse gravimetry,Normal-modes,Reproducing kernel,Spline,Sparse regularisation"
1421,Parameter-uniform fractional step hybrid numerical scheme for 2D singularly perturbed parabolic convection–diffusion problems,"This article focuses on developing and analyzing an efficient numerical scheme for solving two-dimensional singularly perturbed parabolic convection–diffusion initial-boundary value problems exhibiting a regular boundary layer. For approximating the time derivative, we use the Peaceman–Rachford alternating direction implicit method on uniform mesh and for the spatial discretization, a hybrid finite difference scheme is proposed on a special rectangular mesh which is tensor-product of piecewise-uniform Shishkin meshes in the spatial directions. We prove that the numerical scheme converges uniformly with respect to the perturbation parameter \(\varepsilon \) and also attains almost second-order spatial accuracy in the discrete supremum norm. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate the theoretical results. In addition to this, numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effect of the time-dependent boundary conditions in the order of convergence numerically by introducing the classical evaluation of the boundary data; and also the improvement in the spatial order of accuracy of the present method by considering the Bakhvalov–Shishkin mesh in the spatial directions.","Kaushik Mukherjee1 & Srinivasan Natesan

The cylinder’s diameter is 35 times larger than the diameter of the injected body. The numerical simulation is carried out using multilevel Cartesian grids with the local adaptation based on the wavelet analysis. The body’s motion is simulated by the free boundary method. The dynamics of the moving body’s interaction with the bow shock from the cylinder, the formation of the reverse flow region between the bodies, its evolution and disappearance, and the subsequent establishment of a stationary flow are studied. The decrease of the main body’s drag to 20% of the initial value is demonstrated.","A. L. Afendikov1, Ya. V. Khankhasaeva1, A. E. Lutsky1, I. S. Menshov1 & …V. S.

1426,Numerical behaviour of the modified gram-schmidt GMRES implementation,"In [6] the Generalized Minimal Residual Method (GMRES) which constructs the Arnoldi basis and then solves the transformed least squares problem was studied. It was proved that GMRES with the Householder orthogonalization-based implementation of the Arnoldi process (HHA), see [9], is backward stable. In practical computations, however, the Householder orthogonalization is too expensive, and it is usually replaced by the modified Gram-Schmidt process (MGSA). Unlike the HHA case, in the MGSA implementation the orthogonality of the Arnoldi basis vectors is not preserved near the level of machine precision. Despite this, the MGSA-GMRES performs surprisingly well, and its convergence behaviour and the ultimately attainable accuracy do not differ significantly from those of the HHA-GMRES. As it was observed, but not explained, in [6], it is thelinear independence of the Arnoldi basis, not the orthogonality near machine precision, that is important. Until the linear independence of the basis vectors is nearly lost, the norms of the residuals in the MGSA implementation of GMRES match those of the HHA implementation despite the more significant loss of orthogonality.In this paper we study the MGSA implementation. It is proved that the Arnoldi basis vectors begin to lose their linear independenceonly after the GMRES residual norm has been reduced to almost its final level of accuracy, which is proportional to κ(A)ε, where κ(A) is the condition number ofA and ε is the machine precision. Consequently, unless the system matrix is very ill-conditioned, the use of the modified Gram-Schmidt GMRES is theoretically well-justified.","A. Greenbaum1, M. Rozložník2 & Z.

However, the phenomenon of anomalous diffusion in discontinuous media (fractal, porous, etc.) shows that classical diffusion theory is no longer suitable. The differential equations with fractional order have recently been proved to be powerful tools for describing anomalous diffusion. Nevertheless, the analysis methods and numerical methods for fractional differential equations are still in the stage of exploration. In the paper, we consider the Sturm-Liouville problem and the numerical method of a fractional sub-diffusion equation with Dirichlet condition, respectively. We have given the series solution of equation and proved the stability and the convergence of the implicit numerical scheme. It is found that the numerical results are in satisfactory agreement with the analytical solution.

These problems usually entail very large computational costs and require also a suitable approach for representing and deforming efficiently the shape of the underlying geometry, as well as for computing the shape gradient of the cost functional to be minimized. Several approaches based on the displacement of a set of control points have been developed in the last decades, such as the so-called free-form deformations. In this paper we present a new theoretical result which allows to recast free-form deformations into the general class of perturbation of identity maps, and to guarantee the compactness of the set of admissible shapes. Moreover, we address both a general optimization framework based on the continuous shape gradient and a numerical procedure for solving efficiently three-dimensional optimal design problems.

The thin plate splines can be seen as a type of the free shape parameter radial basis functions which are used to establish an effective technique for the interpolation of an unknown function. The numerical method developed in the current paper utilizes the non-uniform Gauss–Legendre quadrature rule to compute its integrals.

The LBFS is used to discretize the macroscopic differential equations with a finite volume method and evaluate the interface fluxes through local reconstruction of the lattice Boltzmann solution.

Like the deterministic model, the dynamics of the stochastic model is also governed by a threshold parameter \({A}^{*}\), called FMD generation number. If we are able to make \({A}^{*} < 1\), then the disease will completely die out from the animal population. If \({A}^{*} > 1\), the disease will become endemic in animals.

1445,A new analytical-numerical method for calculating interacting stresses of a multi-hole problem under both remote and arbitrary surface stresses,"Based on the elementary solutions and new integral equations, a new analytical-numerical method is proposed to calculate the interacting stresses of multiple circular holes in an infinite elastic plate under both remote stresses and arbitrarily distributed stresses applied to the circular boundaries. The validity of this new analytical-numerical method is verified by the analytical solution of the bi-harmonic stress function method, the numerical solution of the finite element method, and the analytical-numerical solutions of the series expansion and Laurent series methods. Some numerical examples are presented to investigate the effects of the hole geometry parameters (radii and relative positions) and loading conditions (remote stresses and surface stresses) on the interacting tangential stresses and interacting stress concentration factors. The results show that whether the interference effect is shielding (k < 1) or amplifying (k > 1) depends on the relative orientation of holes (α) and remote stresses (<∞x
, <∞y
). When the maximum principal stress is aligned with the connecting line of two-hole centers and <∞y

The method is based on converting the model into a system of a nonlinear algebraic equation which is then solved using a novel iterative technique. To check the perfection and exactness of the proposed schemes, two novel residual error correction methods are illustrated to ensure that the method is effective. The method does not require any extensive computational time while providing good results. Some numerical simulations are provided and a comparison is made with other existing methods from the literature. From these results, it can be seen that the Bernoulli collocation method is effective yet simple in providing accurate results for such a model.

We first provide the detailed error estimate of a high-order numerical method proposed recently by Li et al. [21] for solving time fractional partial differential equation. We prove that this method has the convergence order O(τ3−α) for all α ∈ (0, 1) when the first and second derivatives of the solution are vanish at t = 0, where τ is the time step size and α is the fractional order in the Caputo sense. We then introduce a new time discretization method for solving time fractional partial differential equations, which has no requirements for the initial values as imposed in Li et al. [21]. We show that this new method also has the convergence order O(τ3−α) for all α ∈ (0, 1). The proofs of the error estimates are based on the energy method developed recently by Lv and Xu [26]. We also consider the space discretization by using the finite element method. Error estimates with convergence order O(τ3−α + h2) are proved in the fully discrete case, where h is the space step size.

Based on the decomposition of Toeplitz inversion and order-reduction algorithm, two new algorithms for the product of symmetric Toplitz inversion and the vector are proposed. Also, we give two fast algorithms for the solution of corner-modified symmetric Toeplitz linear system. The structured perturbation analysis of the symmetric Toplitz matrix inversion is presented next. We exploit the proposed methods for image encryption and decryption, which can be performed via the fast (corner-modified) symmetric Toeplitz matrix–vector multiplications, and (corner-modified) symmetric Toeplitz linear solvers. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithms are accurate and effective, especially in high-order systems (often over \(2^{12}\)).","Xing Zhang1,2, Yanpeng Zheng

The surface is assumed to be executing harmonic oscillations about a constant mean velocity. By the use of appropriate transformations, governing equations and boundary conditions are obtained in dimensionless form. Due to non-availability of analytical methods for the solution of 3D boundary-layer equations, we have chosen to employ explicit finite difference method to obtain the solution of the set of equations, and utilized MATLAB to extract information about the profiles of velocity and temperature, skin-friction and rate of heat transfer. Von-Neumann stability analysis of this scheme is also done to ensure the accuracy of solutions and boundedness of errors. The results reveal that thermal radiation elevates the rate of heat transfer in primary direction whereas rotation has opposite influence on it.",Rakesh Kumar,International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40819-017-0444-z,"3D flow,Cu nanoparticles,Thermal radiation,Rotating medium,Oscillating surface"
1454,Numerical Study of Partial Differential Equations by an Adaptive Diffusion Wavelet Method,"In the paper, an adaptive diffusion wavelet method (ADWM) is developed to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) with different boundary conditions. We construct diffusion wavelets using an approximation of second-order differential operators. We test the squeezing error behavior corresponding to different parameters involved in the constructed diffusion wavelet, using two test functions. The diffusion wavelet is used to construct adaptive grid arrangements and the fast computation of the diffusion operator’s dual power. The constructed adaptive grid arrangements and dual power of diffusion operators are more effective for finding the numerical solutions of PDEs. Test problems verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. For each test problem, the processing time taken by ADWM is compared with the existing methods like the fast diffusion wavelet method (FDWM) and finite difference method (FDM). The proposed method (ADWM) takes lesser processing time than FDWM and FDM. We verify the convergence of the given method.

1456,Estimating and localizing the algebraic and total numerical errors using flux reconstructions,"This paper presents a methodology for computing upper and lower bounds for both the algebraic and total errors in the context of the conforming finite element discretization of the Poisson model problem and an arbitrary iterative algebraic solver. The derived bounds do not contain any unspecified constants and allow estimating the local distribution of both errors over the computational domain. Combining these bounds, we also obtain guaranteed upper and lower bounds on the discretization error. This allows to propose novel mathematically justified stopping criteria for iterative algebraic solvers ensuring that the algebraic error will lie below the discretization one. Our upper algebraic and total error bounds are based on locally reconstructed fluxes in \({\mathbf {H}}(\mathrm{div},\varOmega )\), whereas the lower algebraic and total error bounds rely on locally constructed \(H^1_0(\varOmega )\)-liftings of the algebraic and total residuals. We prove global and local efficiency of the upper bound on the total error and its robustness with respect to the approximation polynomial degree. Relationships to the previously published estimates on the algebraic error are discussed. Theoretical results are illustrated on numerical experiments for higher-order finite element approximations and the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. They in particular witness that the proposed methodology yields a tight estimate on the local distribution of the algebraic and total errors over the computational domain and illustrate the associated cost.","J.

Moreover, the sharp error estimate in \(L^2\)-norm is established, by an elaborate application of the generalized Gauss–Radau projection.

Two deferred equations are used to approximate the solution and the error, respectively, at each integration step. For the solution, the deferred equation, which is based on a modified Euler’s polygon including the information of both the solution and its estimated error at the previous integration step, is solved with the classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. For the error, the deferred equation, which is based on a local Hermite cubic polynomial with three pieces of information—the solution, its estimated error at the previous step, and the constructed solution—is solved by the seventh-order Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method. The constructed algorithm controls the error and possesses a good behavior of error bound in a long time simulation. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the proposed algorithm.","Philsu Kim1, Xiangfan Piao2, WonKyu Jung3 & …Sunyoung Bu",Advances in Difference Equations,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13662-018-1619-6,"Error correction method,Runge–Kutta method,Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method,Long time simulation,Initial value problem"
1459,Governing equations and numerical solutions of tension leg platform with finite amplitude motion,"It is demonstrated that when tension leg platform (TLP) moves with finite amplitude in waves, the inertia force, the drag force and the buoyancy acting on the platform are nonlinear functions of the response of TLP. The tensions of the tethers are also nonlinear functions of the displacement of TLP. Then the displacement, the velocity and the acceleration of TLP should be taken into account when loads are calculated. In addition, equations of motions should be set up on the instantaneous position. A theoretical model for analyzing the nonlinear behavior of a TLP with finite displacement is developed, in which multifold nonlinearities are taken into account, i.e., finite displacement, coupling of the six degrees of freedom, instantaneous position, instantaneous wet surface, free surface effects and viscous drag force. Based on the theoretical model, the comprehensive nonlinear differential equations are deduced. Then the nonlinear dynamic analysis of ISSC TLP in regular waves is performed in the time domain. The degenerative linear solution of the proposed nonlinear model is verified with existing published one. Furthermore, numerical results are presented, which illustrate that nonlinearities exert a significant influence on the dynamic responses of the TLP.","Zeng Xiao-hui Doctor

1460, Numerical Taylor expansions of invariant manifolds in large dynamical systems," In this paper we develop a numerical method for computing higher order local approximations of invariant manifolds, such as stable, unstable or center manifolds near steady states of a dynamical system. The underlying system is assumed to be large in the sense that a large sparse Jacobian at the equilibrium occurs, for which only a linear (black box) solver and a low dimensional invariant subspace is available, but for which methods like the QR–Algorithm are considered to be too expensive. Our method is based on an analysis of the multilinear Sylvester equations for the higher derivatives which can be solved under certain nonresonance conditions. These conditions are weaker than the standard gap conditions on the spectrum which guarantee the existence of the invariant manifold. The final algorithm requires the solution of several large linear systems with a bordered Jacobian. To these systems we apply a block elimination method recently developed by Govaerts and Pryce [12, 14].

The results of computations for 2D examples show, that the method allows to determine an approximation of the global solution to the inverse problem, sufficiently closed to the exact solution. The proposed method can be extended to the problems with an opening of general shape and to the identification problems of small inclusions. However, the mathematical theory of the proposed approach still requires futher research. In particular, the proof of global convergence of the method is an open problem.","L.

We only require a fairly mild condition on the diffusion coefficient, namely to be non-zero in a point of discontinuity of the drift, while we need to impose certain structural assumptions on the measure-dependence of the drift. Second, we study Euler–Maruyama type schemes for the particle system to approximate the solution of the one-dimensional McKean–Vlasov SDE. Here, we will prove strong convergence results in terms of the number of time-steps and number of particles. Due to the discontinuity of the drift, the convergence analysis is non-standard and the usual strong convergence order 1/2 known for the Lipschitz case cannot be recovered for all presented schemes.

1470,Investment in Cleaner Technologies in a Transboundary Pollution Dynamic Game: A Numerical Investigation,"Within a noncooperative transboundary pollution dynamic game, we study the strategic impact of a region’s investment in the adoption of a cleaner technology, as embodied by a reduction in the emission per output ratio, on the equilibrium outcomes and regions’ welfare. The ratio of emissions to output is endogenous and is a decreasing function of the level of the stock of cleaner technology. Each region can invest in a cleaner technology in addition to its control of emissions. Cleaner technology is assumed to be public knowledge so that both regions benefit from the investment in this technology of an individual region. Pollution damage is modeled as a strictly convex function in the pollution stock. We analyze the feedback equilibrium of the noncooperative game between two regions played over an infinite horizon. The formulation of the transboundary pollution dynamic game does not fit any special structure of analytically tractable games such as linear-state or linear-quadratic differential games. We use numerical methods to characterize the feedback equilibrium of the noncooperative game. The equilibrium trajectories of the stocks of pollution and cleaner technology as well the regions’ welfare are compared under different scenarios.

1471,Clean numerical simulation: a new strategy to obtain reliable solutions of chaotic dynamic systems,"It is well-known that chaotic dynamic systems, e.g., three-body system and turbulent flow, have sensitive dependence on the initial conditions (SDIC). Unfortunately, numerical noises, i.e., truncation error and round-off error, always exist in practice. Thus, due to the SDIC, the long-term accurate prediction of chaotic dynamic systems is practically impossible. In this paper, a new strategy for chaotic dynamic systems, i.e., the clean numerical simulation (CNS), is briefly described, and applied to a few Hamiltonian chaotic systems. With negligible numerical noises, the CNS can provide convergent (reliable) chaotic trajectories in a long enough interval of time. This is very important for Hamiltonian systems, and thus should have many applications in various fields. It is found that the traditional numerical methods in double precision cannot give not only reliable trajectories but also reliable Fourier power spectra and autocorrelation functions (ACFs). In addition, even the statistic properties of chaotic systems cannot be correctly obtained by means of traditional numerical algorithms in double precision, as long as these statistics are time-dependent. The CNS results strongly suggest that one had better to be very careful on the direct numerical simulation (DNS) results of statistically unsteady turbulent flows, although DNS results often agree well with experimental data when the turbulent flow is in a statistical stationary state.","Xiaoming Li1 & Shijun Liao1,2,3,",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-018-2383-6,"chaos,numerical noise,clean numerical simulation (CNS),reliability of computation"

We present an analytical formula for hydraulic conductivity based on Poiseuille flow that can be used in network models contrasting the typical geometric approach leading to many different estimations of the hydraulic conductivity. We consider perturbations to an equilateral triangle by changing the length of one of the triangle sides. We look at both small and large triangles in order to capture triangles that are near and far from equilateral.

The mounted position is chosen at 0.065–0.09 of chord length from the leading edge. The influence of oscillation frequency is investigated both by numerical simulations and experiments. The optimal frequencies are near the dominant frequencies of shear layer vortices and wake vortices. The patterns of shear vortices caused by local vibration are also studied to determine the drag reduction mechanism of this flow control method.

In this paper, the rear-end shape optimization of Ahmed body is performed. Before changing the geometry, to identify the suitable simulation method and validate it, the standard Ahmed body is simulated using k − ω shear stress transport (SST) and k-epsilon turbulence models. The slant angle, rear box angle, and rear box length as variables were optimized simultaneously. Optimizations conducted by genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods indicate a 26.3% decrease in the drag coefficient. To ensure the validity of the results, a numerical-experimental study is conducted on the optimized model. Thereafter, the velocity profiles and flow structure in the boundary layers of the original geometry were compared to those of the optimized geometry at different sections. The results indicate that there are points where the velocity profile in the boundary layer can exceed the free stream velocity and return to it again, an overlooked observation in the previous studies.

In these cells, the strands are modelled as a three-dimensional (3D) finite element beam. In particular, we consider four types of strands cross sections: (1) circular (2) square (3) triangular and (4) Plateau shape. Our numerical results are in agreement with the experimental results obtained on a real Nickel metallic foam. In addition, we perform a parametric analysis to study the effect of some geometrical characteristics on the elasticity of a metal foam. Among these geometrical characteristics, we consider the shape and dimensions of strands cross section as well as the inertia variation.","Sid Ali Kaoua1, Salah Boutaleb2, Djaffar Dahmoun1 & …Mohammed Azzaz",Computational and Applied Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-015-0217-4,"Modelling,Metal foam,Kelvin model,3D Beam finite element, Tensile loading"
1479,Numerical solving of equations in the work of José Mariano Vallejo,"The progress of Mathematics during the nineteenth century was characterised both by an enormous acquisition of new knowledge and by the attempts to introduce rigour in reasoning patterns and mathematical writing. Cauchy’s presentation of Mathematical Analysis was not immediately accepted, and many writers, though aware of that new style, did not use it in their own mathematical production. This paper is devoted to an episode of this sort that took place in Spain during the first half of the century: It deals with the presentation of a method for numerically solving algebraic equations by José Mariano Vallejo, a late Spanish follower of the Enlightenment ideas, politician, writer, and mathematician who published it in the fourth (1840) edition of his book Compendio de Matemáticas Puras y Mistas, claiming to have discovered it on his own. Vallejo’s main achievement was to write down the whole procedure in a very careful way taking into account the different types of roots, although he paid little attention to questions such as convergence checks and the fulfilment of the hypotheses of Rolle’s Theorem. For sure this lack of mathematical care prevented Vallejo to occupy a place among the forerunners of Computational Algebra.","José-Miguel Pacheco Castelao1, F.

1480,A numerical study for optimal low-thrust limited power transfers between coplanar orbits with small eccentricities,"A numerical study of optimal time-fixed low-thrust limited power transfers (no rendezvous), in an inverse-square force field, between coplanar orbits with small eccentricities is performed by means of two different approaches. The first approach uses a numerical method based on the second variation theory, usually known as neighboring extremals method, to solve the two-point boundary value problem obtained from the application of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to the optimization problem formulated as a Mayer problem with the radial distance and the components of the velocity vector as state variables. The second approach is based on the solution of the two-point boundary value problem defined by a first-order analytical solution expressed in terms of non-singular orbital elements, which include short periodic terms, and derived through canonical transformations theory in a previous work. For transfers between close orbits, a simplified solution expressed by a linear system of algebraic equations is straightforwardly derived from this analytical first-order solution. In this case, the two-point boundary value problem can be solved by simple techniques. Numerical results are presented for transfers between circular orbits, considering several radius ratios and transfer durations. Some maneuvers involving orbits with arbitrary small eccentricities are also considered. The fuel consumption is taken as the performance criterion in comparison of the results.","Francisco das Chagas Carvalho1, Sandro da Silva Fernandes2 & Rodolpho Vilhena de Moraes",Computational and Applied Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-016-0325-9,"Optimization of space trajectories,Low-thrust limited power trajectories,Transfers between coplanar orbits with small eccentricities,Neighboring extremals method"

1482,Numerical simulation for 2D double-diffusive convection (DDC) in rectangular enclosures based on a high resolution upwind compact streamfunction model I: numerical method and code validation,"A high resolution upwind compact streamfunction numerical algorithm for two-dimensional (2D) double-diffusive convection (DDC) is developed. The unsteady Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in the streamfunction-velocity form and the scalar temperature and concentration equations are used. An optimized third-order upwind compact (UCD3_opt) scheme with a low dispersion error for the first derivatives is utilized to approximate the third derivatives of the streamfunction in the advection terms of the N-S equations and the first derivatives in the advection terms of the scalar temperature and concentration equations. The remaining first derivatives of the streamfunction (velocity), temperature, and concentration variables used in the governing equations are discretized by the fourth-order compact Padé (SCD4) schemes. With the temperature and concentration variables and their approximate values of the first derivatives obtained by the SCD4 schemes, the explicit fourth-order compact schemes are suggested to approximate the second derivatives of temperature and concentration in the diffusion terms of the energy and concentration equations. The discretization of the temporal term is executed with the second-order Crank-Nicolson (C-N) scheme. To assess the spatial behavior capability of the established numerical algorithm and verify the developed computer code, the DDC flow is numerically solved. The obtained results agree well with the benchmark solutions and some accurate results available in the literature, verifying the accuracy, effectiveness, and robustness of the provided algorithm. Finally, a preliminary application of the proposed method to the DDC is carried out.","Yaping Yan1,2, Shuang Wu1, Kaiyuan Tian3,4 & …Zhenfu Tian1,",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-022-2895-6,"double diffusive convection (DDC),high resolution,heat and mass transfer,upwind compact difference,streamfunction formulation"
1483,Conservative Numerical Schemes with Optimal Dispersive Wave Relations: Part II. Numerical Evaluations,"A new energy and enstrophy conserving scheme (EEC) for the shallow water equations is proposed and evaluated using a suite of test cases over the global spherical or bounded domain.
 The evaluation is organized around a set of pre-defined properties: accuracy of individual operators, accuracy of the whole scheme, conservation of key quantities, control of the divergence variable, representation of the energy and enstrophy spectra, and simulation of nonlinear dynamics. The results confirm that the scheme is between the first and second order accurate, and conserves the total energy and potential enstrophy up to the time truncation errors. The scheme is capable of producing more physically realistic energy and enstrophy spectra, indicating that it can help prevent the unphysical energy cascade towards the finest resolvable scales. With an optimal representation of the dispersive wave relations, the scheme is able to keep the flow close to being non-divergent, and maintain the geostrophically balanced structures with large-scale geophysical flows over long-term simulations.","Qingshan Chen

1484,Acoustically generated unsteady vorticity field in a long narrow cylinder with sidewall injection,"Asymptotic and computational analyses of a well-posed initial-boundary-value problem are used to describe the time history of co-existing acoustic and rotational velocity disturbances in a long, narrow cylinder with uniform steady sidewall mass injection. Transient planar pressure disturbances prescribed on the open exit plane of the cylinder are the source of acoustic disturbances in the axisymmetric flow. Both the asymptotic and numerical solutions describe the nonlinear aspects of the flow interactions. The full computational results are compared favorably with those of the asymptotic study to show that; (1) transient vorticity is generated near the injection surface and is transported into the cylinder by the radial velocity component of the flow field, (2) at any sufficiently small value of time, a well defined front separates the fluid containing transient vorticity from a flow field in the interior of the cylinder containing a much smaller amplitude vorticity and, (3) at sufficiently large values of time, vorticity is present throughout the cylinder. In addition, the analytically derived acoustic solution obtained from the asymptotic analysis is used to show that the present numerical solution and all earlier studies of similar problems are missing travelling waves (eigenfunctions) which should be present in a complete mathematical solution of the defined initial-boundary-value problem.","Kadir Kirkkopru1, David R.

Finally, another equation, which is generated by using the eigenvectors, is solved to produce a surface Green’s function. In numerical computations, a perturbation will be added into the matrix at the first step. As a result, by computing the eigenvectors of the perturbed matrix at the second step, a considerable numerical error of the function will emerge at the third step. In this paper, we modify the algorithm in order to successfully compute surface Green’s functions. We replace the first and second steps in the algorithm by an alternative step so that we can compute the eigenvectors of the matrix without computing the matrix.

Bottom hole pressure response curves and the pressure field are obtained by solving the model equations with the finite-element method. By analyzing bottom hole pressure curves and the fluid flow in the pressure field, seven flow stages can be recognized on the curves. An upscaling method is developed to compare with the dual-porosity model (DPM). The comparisons results show that the DPM overestimates the inter-porosity coefficient λ and the storage factor ω. The analysis results show that fracture conductivity plays a leading role in the fluid flow. Matrix permeability influences the beginning time of flow from the matrix to fractures. Fractures density is another important parameter controlling the flow. The fracture linear flow is hidden under the large fracture density.

Both the viscosity and thermal conductivity are assumed to vary as a linear function of the temperature, and dynamic viscosity is considered in a new form. Using an appropriate transformation, the governing partial differential equations are transformed into ordinary differential equations. Numerical solutions to these equations subject to corresponding boundary conditions are obtained by efficient numerical shooting technique coupled with Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg scheme. The effects of pertinent parameters are shown through tables and graphs, and meanwhile the associated transfer characteristics are analyzed in detail. The results show that: with the increase of viscosity variation parameter or the thermal conductivity, the local skin-friction coefficient increases but the local Nusselt number decreases. The increasing in viscosity variation parameter is to increase the velocity boundary layer thickness and decrease in the magnitude of the velocity gradient. Furthermore, thermal conductivity parameter has the same effect on the thermal boundary layer thickness and the temperature gradient.","Wenli Cai1, Ning Su2 & Xijun He",Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computing,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12190-015-0942-2,"MHD,Temperature-dependent viscosity,Temperature-dependent thermal conductivity,Heat transfer,Stretching wedge"

1589,Parameter uniform numerical method for a system of two coupled singularly perturbed parabolic convection-diffusion equations,"In this paper, we propose a numerical scheme for a system of two linear singularly perturbed parabolic convection-diffusion equations. The presented numerical scheme consists of a classical backward-Euler scheme on a uniform mesh for the time discretization and an upwind finite difference scheme on an arbitrary nonuniform mesh for the spatial discretization. Then, for the time semidiscretization scheme, an a priori and an a posteriori error estimations in the maximum norm are obtained. It should be pointed out that the a posteriori error bound is suitable to design an adaptive algorithm, which is used to generate an adaptive spatial grid. It is proved that the method converges uniformly in the discrete maximum norm with first-order time and spatial accuracy, respectively, for the fully discrete scheme. At last, some numerical results are given to validate the theoretical results.","Li-Bin Liu1, Guangqing Long1 & Yong Zhang",Advances in Difference Equations,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13662-018-1907-1,"65M06,65M12"

The calculations are based upon a velocity–vorticity formulation of the governing equations which allows efficient tracking of the time evolution of disturbances. The neutral-stability curve for two-dimensional disturbances was computed and found to agree well with the predictions of earlier semi-analytical studies. Further previously determined properties of two-dimensional disturbances in a Stokes layer were also compared to the results obtained by direct numerical simulation.

The first requirement can be formulated in a more specific form of consistency of an a posteriori bound, assuming that it is not improvable in the order and, at least, coincides in the order with the a priori error estimate. Several new a posteriori error bounds are presented, which improve accuracy and reduce the computational cost.

1592,Quantification of Errors Introduced in the Numerical Approximation and Implementation of Smoothness-Increasing Accuracy Conserving (SIAC) Filtering of Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Fields,"The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method continues to maintain heightened levels of interest within the simulation community because of the discretization flexibility it provides. Although one of the fundamental properties of the DG methodology and arguably its most powerful property is the ability to combine high-order discretizations on an inter-element level while allowing discontinuities between elements, this flexibility generates a plethora of difficulties when one attempts to post-process DG fields for analysis and evaluation of scientific results. Smoothness-increasing accuracy-conserving (SIAC) filtering enhances the smoothness of the field by eliminating the discontinuity between elements in a way that is consistent with the DG methodology; in particular, high-order accuracy is preserved and in many cases increased. Fundamental to the post-processing approach is the convolution of a spline-based kernel against a DG field.This paper presents a study of the impact of numerical quadrature approximations on the resulting convolution. We discuss both theoretical estimates as well as empirical results which demonstrate the efficacy of the post-processing approach when different levels and types of quadrature approximation are used. Finally, we provide some guidelines for effective use of SIAC filtering of DG fields when used as input to common post-processing and visualization techniques.","Hanieh Mirzaee1, Jennifer K.

In addition, the transient dynamics from traveling breathers to standing breathers have been numerically investigated, and the existence and stability of breathers have been studied by (semi-)rigorous approaches. However, the mechanism of transient dynamics has yet to be clarified, even using numerical approaches, since the global bifurcation diagram of breathers has not been obtained. In this article, we propose a numerical scheme that enables unstable breathers to be tracked. By using the global bifurcation diagram, we numerically investigate the global behavior of unstable manifolds emanating from the bifurcation point associated with the transient dynamics and clarify the onset mechanism of the transient dynamics.","Masaharu Nagayama1,2, Kei-ichi Ueda3 & Masaaki Yadome",Japan Journal of Industrial and Applied Mathematics,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13160-010-0015-8,"Oscillatory pulse,Reaction–diffusion system,Transient dynamics,Bifurcation"

The problem is considered in the traditional formulation without introducing instability exciters. Unstable modes arise due to the controlled background of small perturbations of the exact solutions produced by the truncation errors of the scheme. The presented solutions describe a scenario in which packets of Tollmien–Schlichting waves of time-dependent intensity develop near the leading edge of the plate and propagate downstream with increasing amplitudes. The influence exerted by the spectral content of the dissipative part of the scheme on the wave numbers and the amplitudes of the wave packets is estimated.

1616,An industrial view on numerical simulation for aircraft aerodynamic design,"In Airbus view, one major objective for the aircraft industry is the reduction of aircraft development lead-time and the provision of robust solutions with highly improved quality. In that context it is important to exploit all opportunities provided by enhanced or new classes of numerical simulation tools, e.g. high fidelity multi-disciplinary Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and powerful High Performance Computing (HPC) capabilities.To help meet the challenge of superior product development it will finally be essential to numerically ‘flight-test’ a virtual aircraft with all its multi-disciplinary interactions in a computer environment and to compile all of the data required for the development and certification with guaranteed accuracy in a reduced time frame. Numerical simulation is foreseen to provide a tremendous increase in aircraft design efficiency and quality over the next decades. This concept is considered by Airbus as one of the long term main objectives for aircraft development.Progress in HPC will essentially contribute to achieve this goal. Considerable changes of aircraft design processes and way of working will lead to significant reduction of development times while including more and more disciplines in the early phases of design activities in order to find an overall optimum aircraft design.Aerodynamic Design deals with the development of outer shapes of an aircraft, optimizing for its performance, handling qualities and loads. A major ingredient to the design process is the numerical simulation of the external airflow. The capabilities to predict the flow not only near the design point but also under other challenging conditions in a given flight envelope is a prerequisite for optimization towards market requirements.Since it began about 50 years ago, CFD has made important progress in terms of accuracy of the physical models, robustness and efficiency of the nonlinear solution algorithms and reliability of the overall prediction approach. This trend will continue over the next decades. In our view, along with the increasing capability to model and compute all major multi-disciplinary aspects of an aircraft, in the long term it will become possible to ‘fly’ and investigate the complete aircraft in the computer.Currently numerical simulation provides good means to analyse the flow around the aircraft in detail, although the regime of flow separation onset up to maximum lift conditions is still not modelled accurately enough, nonlinearities and turbulence modelling for separated flows are still a major concern.It was not only the increase in HPC power that made more sophisticated Navier-Stokes solving enter the daily industrial design process. Better understanding and mathematical analysis of the system of Navier-Stokes equations led to more powerful algorithms, to more capable software and more comprehensive analysis of aircraft flows.However, a lot work remains to be done. Next decade’s goal will be to better exploit more accurate and efficient numerical formulations, advanced turbulence models and to achieve a fully flexible and automatic CFD capability that works in a fully adaptive manner, providing the best quality solution at minimum cost and time. This will lead to a complete change in the way future aircraft will be designed.",Adel Abbas-Bayoumi1 & Klaus Becker,Journal of Mathematics in Industry,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2190-5983-1-10,"Computational Fluid Dynamics,Wind Tunnel,Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulation,Aircraft Design,Computational Fluid Dynamics Result"

When modelling surface or interface waves an incompatibility of the numerical flux with the physical boundary condition leads to numerical artefacts. We present a stable and arbitrary order accurate DG method for elastic waves with a physically motivated numerical flux. Our numerical flux is compatible with all well-posed, internal and external, boundary conditions, including linear and nonlinear frictional constitutive equations for modelling spontaneously propagating shear ruptures in elastic solids and dynamic earthquake rupture processes. By construction our choice of penalty parameters yield an upwind scheme and a discrete energy estimate analogous to the continuous energy estimate. We derive a priori error estimate for the DG method proving optimal convergence to discontinuous and nearly singular exact solutions. The spectral radius of the resulting spatial operator has an upper bound which is independent of the boundary and interface conditions, thus it is suitable for efficient explicit time integration. We present numerical experiments in one and two space dimensions verifying high order accuracy and asymptotic numerical stability. We demonstrate the potential of the method for modelling complex nonlinear frictional problems in elastic solids with 2D dynamically adaptive meshes and non-planar topography with 2D curvilinear elements.","Kenneth Duru

1623,Numerical methods for hyperbolic SPDEs: a Wiener chaos approach ,"In this paper we propose a novel numerical scheme based on the Wiener chaos expansion for solving hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs). Through the Wiener chaos expansion the stochastic PDE is reduced to an infinite hierarchy of deterministic PDEs which is then truncated to a finite system of PDEs, that can be addressed by standard techniques. A priori and a posteriori convergence results for the method are provided. The proposed method is applied to solve the stochastic wave equation with additive noise and the stochastic Klein–Gordon wave equation with multiplicative noise and the results are compared to those derived by the Monte Carlo method. The main advantages of the proposed scheme is that it provides almost identical results and is significantly faster than the Monte Carlo simulation method, providing a convenient way to compute numerically the statistical moments of the solution.","Evangelia A.

1624,Numerical use of exterior singularities for computation of gravity waves in shallow water,"This paper describes fully nonlinear, fully dispersive computation for two-dimensional motion of periodic gravity waves of permanent form in an ideal fluid of arbitrary uniform depth. The rate of convergence of a series solution of this motion becomes slow with decrease of the water depth-to-wavelength ratio, and a considerably large number of terms in series are required to obtain accurate numerical solutions for long waves in shallow water, even if the wave amplitude is small. Domb–Sykes plots for coefficients of the computed series solutions show that the slow rate of convergence is due to a singularity outside the flow domain in a conformally mapped complex plane. This exterior singularity can be theoretically estimated using analytic continuation of an ordinary differential equation given by the free surface condition. It is shown that a conformal mapping regularizes this singularity and enlarges the radius of convergence of a series solution. In addition, iterative use of this mapping for regularization further improves convergence. This work proposes a new method to compute long waves in shallow water using regularization of the exterior singularity. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method can produce accurate enough solutions for a wide range of water depth-to-wavelength ratios. Validity of cnoidal wave solutions is also discussed using comparison with the computed results.",Sunao Murashige,Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-012-9541-5,"Analytic continuation,Conformal mapping,Numerical computation,Singularity,Water waves"

Domains are bounded, and have finite fluctuations. The key feature is the combination of a fictitious domain approach and a polynomial chaos expansion. The PDE is solved in a larger, fixed domain (the fictitious domain), with the original boundary condition enforced via a Lagrange multiplier acting on a random manifold inside the new domain. A (generalized) Wiener expansion is invoked to convert such a stochastic problem into a deterministic one, depending on an extra set of real variables (the stochastic variables). Discretization is accomplished by standard mixed finite elements in the physical variables and a Galerkin projection method with numerical integration (which coincides with a collocation scheme) in the stochastic variables. A stability and convergence analysis of the method, as well as numerical results, are provided.

Under the assumption of sufficiently fast spatial decay of the entropy solution we can even establish the convergence rate h

1639,Mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of wave-front flow on a vertical wall with surfactant effects,"The modeling of thin-layer flow in the presence of surfactant is considered. The classical problem of wave-front flow down a vertical wall, as discussed by Tuck and Schwartz (SIAM Rev 32:453, 1990), is extended to demonstrate the effects of an assumed insoluble surfactant. Results using the thin-layer approximation (“lubrication theory”) are compared with numerical solutions of the full Navier–Stokes problem using a volume-of-fluid method. The surfactant takes the form of either (i) a concentrated clump, or ‘bolus,’ or (ii) an initially uniform distribution. The basic problem is two-dimensional downhill flow from thick to thin wetting layers. If no surfactant is present, or if the surfactant is entirely passive, and if the layers are long, a steadily propagating solution exists. A discrete quantity of surfactant, when deposited on the liquid surface will be transported to the neighbourhood of the wave front. An apparently stable steady-state will ultimately arise. Similar surfactant transport will occur for uniform surfactant, although no steady-state solution is possible then because the quantity of surfactant becomes unbounded. The volume-of-fluid calculations confirm the validity of all the qualitative features revealed by the lubrication analysis. Quantitative discrepancies appear when the evolving free-surface slope or curvature is no longer small, even in the absence of surfactant effect.",L. W. Schwartz1 & M. R.

1641,Asymptotic and numerical study of resonant tunneling in two-dimensional quantum waveguides of variable cross section,"A waveguide is considered that coincides with a strip having two narrows of width ɛ. The electron wave function satisfies the Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The part of the waveguide between the narrows plays the role of a resonator, and there arise conditions for electron resonant tunneling. This phenomenon means that, for an electron of energy E, the probability T(E) of passing from one part of the waveguide to the other through the resonator has a sharp peak at E = E
res, where E
res is a “resonant” energy. To analyze the operation of electronic devices based on resonant tunneling, it is important to know E
res and the behavior of T(E) for E close to E
res. Asymptotic formulas for the resonance energy and the transition and reflection coefficients as ɛ → 0 are derived. These formulas depend on the limit shape of the narrows. The limit waveguide near each narrow is assumed to coincide with a pair of vertical angles. The asymptotic results are compared with numerical ones obtained by approximately computing the waveguide scattering matrix. Based on this comparison, the range of ɛ is found in which the asymptotic approach agrees with the numerical results. The methods proposed are applicable to much more complicated models than that under consideration. Specifically, the same approach is suitable for an asymptotic and numerical analysis of tunneling in three-dimensional quantum waveguides of variable cross section.","L. M. Baskin1, M. Kabardov1, P.

1648,"A Positivity Preserving, Energy Stable Finite Difference Scheme for the Flory-Huggins-Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes System","In this paper, we propose and analyze a finite difference numerical scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system, with logarithmic Flory-Huggins energy potential. In the numerical approximation to the singular chemical potential, the logarithmic term and the surface diffusion term are implicitly updated, while an explicit computation is applied to the concave expansive term. Moreover, the convective term in the phase field evolutionary equation is approximated in a semi-implicit manner. Similarly, the fluid momentum equation is computed by a semi-implicit algorithm: implicit treatment for the kinematic diffusion term, explicit update for the pressure gradient, combined with semi-implicit approximations to the fluid convection and the phase field coupled term, respectively. Such a semi-implicit method gives an intermediate velocity field. Subsequently, a Helmholtz projection into the divergence-free vector field yields the velocity vector and the pressure variable at the next time step. This approach decouples the Stokes solver, which in turn drastically improves the numerical efficiency. The positivity-preserving property and the unique solvability of the proposed numerical scheme is theoretically justified, i.e., the phase variable is always between -1 and 1, following the singular nature of the logarithmic term as the phase variable approaches the singular limit values. In addition, an iteration construction technique is applied in the positivity-preserving and unique solvability analysis, motivated by the non-symmetric nature of the fluid convection term. The energy stability of the proposed numerical scheme could be derived by a careful estimate. A few numerical results are presented to validate the robustness of the proposed numerical scheme.

1652,Energy Dissipation during Vibrations of Heterogeneous Composite Structures: 3. Numerical Experiments,"The influence of the relative thickness of a “stiff” viscoelastic polymer layer and the orientation of reinforcing layers of the bearing layer on the values of their natural frequencies and loss factors of damped vibrations of an unsupported two-layered composite plate has been investigated. It has been established that each natural vibration mode of a two-layered plate corresponds to a certain effective relative thickness of an isotropic viscoelastic polymer layer. A further increase in the relative thickness of plates with an orthotropic bearing layer depending on ambient temperature may result in both an increase and decrease in natural frequencies without any considerable change in their energy dissipation. For plates with a monoclinic bearing layer, the increase in relative thickness of the isotropic viscoelastic polymer layer is accompanied by both a decrease and increase of loss factor for different vibration modes. It is shown that a change in the stacking sequence of reinforcing layers in the bearing layer brings about mutual transformation domains of coupled vibration modes. It has been established that the mutual transformation of the natural shapes of coupled modes of an unsupported quasi-uniform rectangular plate vibrations appears if one of the natural shapes has an even number of quarter-wavelengths in at least one of the plate directions, whereas another natural shape has an odd number of those. It has been demonstrated that the temperature-frequency relationship of elastic-dissipative characteristics of the “stiff” viscoelastic polymer has a considerable effect upon natural frequencies and loss factors of all the investigated vibration modes for an unsupported rectangular two-layered plate.","L.

1654,Numerical Bifurcation Theory for High-Dimensional Neural Models,"Numerical bifurcation theory involves finding and then following certain types of solutions of differential equations as parameters are varied, and determining whether they undergo any bifurcations (qualitative changes in behaviour). The primary technique for doing this is numerical continuation, where the solution of interest satisfies a parametrised set of algebraic equations, and branches of solutions are followed as the parameter is varied. An effective way to do this is with pseudo-arclength continuation. We give an introduction to pseudo-arclength continuation and then demonstrate its use in investigating the behaviour of a number of models from the field of computational neuroscience. The models we consider are high dimensional, as they result from the discretisation of neural field models—nonlocal differential equations used to model macroscopic pattern formation in the cortex. We consider both stationary and moving patterns in one spatial dimension, and then translating patterns in two spatial dimensions. A variety of results from the literature are discussed, and a number of extensions of the technique are given.",Carlo R Laing,The Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2190-8567-4-13,"Pseudo-arclength,Continuation,Bifurcation,Neural field"

It is deduced from a priori estimates that the approximate solution converges to the weak solution of the reaction-diffusion problem and satisfies estimates which do not depend on the kinetic rate. It follows that the solution converges to the solution of a nonlinear diffusion problem, as the size of the volume elements and the time steps converge to zero while the kinetic rate tends to infinity.","Robert Eymard1, Danielle Hilhorst2, Hideki Murakawa3 & …Michal Olech4,","Chinese Annals of Mathematics, Series B",2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11401-010-0604-5,"Instantaneous reaction limit,Mass-action kinetics,Finite volume methods,Convergence of approximate solutions,Discrete a priori estimates,Kolmogorov’s theorem"
1656,Flow efficiency of perforated systems – a combined analytical and numerical treatment,"The effect of the spatial distribution of perforations on the flow from the reservoir to the wellbore for single phase liquid flow is studied. The reservoir is taken to be isotropic and, for most of the paper, the model used here assumes that the perforations and the wellbore are both undamaged. Thus, there is no change of permeability around the wellbore and perforations. The pressure/flow along a single perforation is studied in detail first and an integral equation is derived which can be solved numerically to give the pressure/flow everywhere along the perforation. The interaction of the perforations is considered by an approximation in which each perforation is represented by a point source of unknown strength positioned at the centre of the perforation. A simple ellipsoidal model of the perforation is also considered which provides a faster approach for evaluating the flow. The resulting flux of fluid from each perforation into the wellbore is presented numerically for the above-mentioned approximate methods and the comparison with the full numerical method is also made. For the ellipsoidal perforation, the modelling of the perforation skin effect (a mathematical treatment of pressure drops which is caused by perforation damage) is also described, but no detailed numerical results are given.",C.Y.

First, we use the mid-point quadrature rule to transform the space distributed-order term into multi-term fractional derivatives. Second, based on the piecewise-quadratic polynomials, we construct the nodal basis functions, and then discretize the multi-term fractional equation by the finite volume method. For the time-fractional derivative, the finite difference method is used. Finally, the iterative scheme is proved to be unconditionally stable and convergent with the accuracy O(σ2 + τ2−β + h3), where τ and h are the time step size and the space step size, respectively. A numerical example is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","Jing Li

In this work, we propose a method so called fractional Chebyshev finite difference method. In this technique, we approximate the proposed model with a finite dimensional problem. The method is based on the combination of the useful properties of Chebyshev polynomials approximation and finite difference method. The Caputo fractional derivative is replaced by a difference quotient and the integral by a finite sum. By this method, the given problem is reduced to a problem for solving a system of algebraic equations, and by solving this system, we obtain the solution of SIRC model.

Two test problems are used to illustrate the accuracy of the present approximation. Comparisons are made with the existing methods in the literature. The approximation is analyzed by von-Neumann stability analysis method and it is displayed that the approximation is unconditionally stable.

1663,Efficient or Inaccurate? Analytical and Numerical Modelling of Random Search Strategies,"A large number of observational and theoretical studies have investigated animal movement strategies for finding randomly located food items. Many of these studies have claimed that a particular strategy is advantageous over other strategies or that the spatial distribution of the food items affects the search efficiency. Here, we study a deliberately idealised problem, in which a blind forager searches for re-visitable food items. We show analytically that the forager’s efficiency is completely independent of both its movement strategy and the spatial pattern of the food items and depends only on the density of food in the environment. However, in some cases, apparent optima in search strategies can arise as artefacts of inappropriate and inaccurate numerical simulations. We discuss modifications to the idealised foraging problem that can confer an advantage on certain strategies, including when the forager has some memory or knowledge of the environment; when the food items are non-revisitable; and when the problem is viewed in an evolutionary context.","Alex James1, Jonathan W.

1664,Hybrid asymptotic/numerical methods for the evaluation of layer heat potentials in two dimensions,"We present a hybrid asymptotic/numerical method for the accurate computation of single- and double-layer heat potentials in two dimensions. It has been shown in previous work that simple quadrature schemes suffer from a phenomenon called “geometrically induced stiffness,” meaning that formally high-order accurate methods require excessively small time steps before the rapid convergence rate is observed. This can be overcome by analytic integration in time, requiring the evaluation of a collection of spatial boundary integral operators with non-physical, weakly singular kernels. In our hybrid scheme, we combine a local asymptotic approximation with the evaluation of a few boundary integral operators involving only Gaussian kernels, which are easily accelerated by a new version of the fast Gauss transform. This new scheme is robust, avoids geometrically induced stiffness, and is easy to use in the presence of moving geometries. Its extension to three dimensions is natural and straightforward, and should permit layer heat potentials to become flexible and powerful tools for modeling diffusion processes.","Jun Wang1,2 & Leslie Greengard

1665,Derivation and numerical validation of a homogenized isothermal Li-ion battery model,"Lithium-ion batteries are multiscale systems with processes occurring at different scales. We start from a mathematical model derived on the microscale level of a single battery cell [Latz et al., NMA’10, 2011, pp. 329–337] where we can resolve the porous structure of the electrodes. Direct numerical simulations on this scale lead to a huge number of degrees of freedom and, consequently, very high computational costs. From an application perspective, it is often sufficient to predict the macroscopic properties of the electrodes. Therefore, we derive homogenized macroscopic equations with effective transport coefficients for the concentration of lithium ions in the electrolyte, potential in the electrolyte, and potential in the solid particles. These upscaled equations are coupled via the Butler–Volmer interface conditions to a microscale equation for the concentration of lithium ions in the electrode particles. We follow the idea developed by Ciucci and Lai [Transport Porous Med 88(2):249–270, 2011] and extend their analysis by computing the asymptotic order of the interface exchange current densities, which is an important factor in the homogenization study of the problem. We also perform a numerical homogenization and run extensive numerical simulations in order to validate the derived upscaled model. The numerical experiments show very good agreement between the homogenized model and the microscale one. Hence we are able to predict the macroscopic properties of the porous electrodes and capture the small-scale effects on the large scales without fully resolving all the microscale features.","Vasilena Taralova1, Oleg Iliev1 & Yalchin Efendiev",Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-015-9842-6,"Coupled macro-microscale model,Effective transport coefficients,Homogenization theory, Li-ion batteries,Numerical results"

The method is implemented for two different cases to obtain the approximate solution of the two dimensional Laplace equation. For both the cases, the inner surfaces are maintained at a constant temperature. However, the outermost periphery is subjected to a constant temperature in the first case and kept at convective condition in the second case. Here the discretization of the boundary produces a system of equations which on solving produce the expression for temperature. The results predicted by BEM are validated with those predicted by Ansys Fluent®. The remarkable accuracy of the results with those obtained from Fluent shows the capability of the method to successfully handle the considered steady-state conduction problem in heat exchanger tubes of multiply connected cross sections. This article uses BEM to study conduction problems in multiply connected exchanger tubes.

The focus is put on a size-structured population balance equation (PBE) predicting the evolution of the number distribution of a single cell population as a function of the size variable. Since the inverse problem at hand is ill-posed, an adequate regularization scheme is required to avoid amplification of measurement errors in the solution method. The technique developed in this work to determine a rate function in a PBE is based on the approximate inverse method, a pointwise regularization scheme, which employs two key ideas. Firstly, the mollification in the directions of time and size variables are separated. Secondly, instable numerical data derivatives are circumvented by shifting the differentiation to an analytically given function. To examine the performance of the introduced scheme, adapted test scenarios have been designed with different levels of data disturbance simulating the model and measurement errors in practice. The success of the method is substantiated by visualizing the results of these numerical experiments.","Andreas Groh1, Holger Kohr2 & Alfred K.

1672,Numerical Methods for the Wigner Equation with Unbounded Potential,"Unbounded potentials are always utilized to strictly confine quantum dynamics and generate bound or stationary states due to the existence of quantum tunneling. However, the existed accurate Wigner solvers are often designed for either localized potentials or those of the polynomial type. This paper attempts to solve the time-dependent Wigner equation in the presence of a general class of unbounded potentials by exploiting two equivalent forms of the pseudo-differential operator: integral form and series form (i.e., the Moyal expansion). The unbounded parts at infinities are approximated or modeled by polynomials and then a remaining localized potential dominates the central area. The fact that the Moyal expansion reduces to a finite series for polynomial potentials is fully utilized. In order to accurately resolve both the pseudo-differential operator and the linear differential operator, a spectral collocation scheme for the phase space and an explicit fourth-order Runge–Kutta time discretization are adopted. We are able to prove that the resulting full discrete spectral scheme conserves both mass and energy. Several typical quantum systems are simulated with a high accuracy and reliable estimation of macroscopically measurable quantities is thus obtained.","Zhenzhu Chen1, Yunfeng Xiong1 & Sihong Shao",Journal of Scientific Computing,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-018-0853-0,"Wigner equation,Moyal expansion,Spectral method,Quantum dynamics,Unbounded potential,Uncertainty principle,Double-well,Pöschl–Teller potential,Anharmonic oscillator"
1673,Scalability of parallel spatial direct numerical simulations on intel hypercube and IBM SP1 and SP2,"The implementation and performance of a parallel spatial direct numerical simulation (PSDNS) approach on the Intel iPSC/860 hypercube and IBM SP1 and SP2 parallel computers is documented. Spatially evolving disturbances associated with laminar-to-turbulent transition in boundary-layer flows are computed with the PSDNS code. The feasibility of using the PSDNS to perform transition studies on these computers is examined. The results indicate that PSDNS approach can effectively be parallelized on a distributed-memory parallel machine by remapping the distributed data structure during the course of the calculation. Scalability information is provided to estimate computational costs to match the actual costs relative to changes in the number of grid points. By increasing the number of processors, slower than linear speedups are achieved with optimized (machine-dependent library) routines. This slower than linear speedup results because the computational cost is dominated by FFT routine, which yields less than ideal speedups. By using appropriate compile options and optimized library routines on the SP1, the serial code achieves 52–56 Mflops on a single node of the SP1 (45 percent of theoretical peak performance). The actual performance of the PSDNS code on the SP1 is evaluated with a “real world” simulation that consists of 1.7 million grid points. One time step of this simulation is calculated on eight nodes of the SP1 in the same time as required by a Cray Y/MP supercomputer. For the same simulation, 32-nodes of the SP1 and SP2 are required to reach the performance of a Cray C-90. A 32 node SP1 (SP2) configuration is 2.9 (4.6) times faster than a Cray Y/MP for this simulation, while the hypercube is roughly 2 times slower than the Y/MP for this application.","Ronald D.

1675,Slip flow of Maxwell viscoelasticity-based micropolar nanoparticles with porous medium: a numerical study,"This article presents the mass and heat transport aspects in viscoelastic nanofluid flows under the presence of velocity slip conditions. To explore the non-Newtonian behavior, a Maxwell viscoelasticity-based micropolar is considered. Moreover, a porous medium saturates the stretching sheet. A set of similarity variables is introduced to derive the dimensionless ordinary differential equations of velocity, concentration, and temperature profiles. The numerical solution is computed by using the MATLAB bvp4c package. The salient flow features of velocity, concentration, and temperature profiles are described and discussed through various graphs. It is observed that with an increase in the slip parameter, the micro-rotation velocity also increases. The temperature of nanoparticles gets maximum values by varying the viscoelastic parameter and the porosity parameter while an opposite trend is noted for the micro-rotation parameter. The local Nusselt number and the local Sherwood number increase by increasing the viscoelastic parameter, the porosity parameter, and the slip velocity parameter.

1676,Primal Dual Methods for Wasserstein Gradient Flows,"Combining the classical theory of optimal transport with modern operator splitting techniques, we develop a new numerical method for nonlinear, nonlocal partial differential equations, arising in models of porous media, materials science, and biological swarming. Our method proceeds as follows: first, we discretize in time, either via the classical JKO scheme or via a novel Crank–Nicolson-type method we introduce. Next, we use the Benamou–Brenier dynamical characterization of the Wasserstein distance to reduce computing the solution of the discrete time equations to solving fully discrete minimization problems, with strictly convex objective functions and linear constraints. Third, we compute the minimizers by applying a recently introduced, provably convergent primal dual splitting scheme for three operators (Yan in J Sci Comput 1–20, 2018). By leveraging the PDEs’ underlying variational structure, our method overcomes stability issues present in previous numerical work built on explicit time discretizations, which suffer due to the equations’ strong nonlinearities and degeneracies. Our method is also naturally positivity and mass preserving and, in the case of the JKO scheme, energy decreasing. We prove that minimizers of the fully discrete problem converge to minimizers of the spatially continuous, discrete time problem as the spatial discretization is refined. We conclude with simulations of nonlinear PDEs and Wasserstein geodesics in one and two dimensions that illustrate the key properties of our approach, including higher-order convergence our novel Crank–Nicolson-type method, when compared to the classical JKO method.","José A.

1688,Error estimates for the numerical approximation of time-dependent flow of Bingham fluid in cylindrical pipes by the regularization method,"The flow of a Bingham fluid in a cylindrical pipe can give rise to free boundary problems. The fluid behaves like a viscous fluid if the shear stress, expressed as a linear function of the shear rate, exceeds a yield value, and like a rigid body otherwise. The surfaces dividing fluid and rigid zones are the free boundaries. Therefore the solution for such highly nonlinear problems can in general only be obtained by numerical methods. Considerable progress has been made in the development of numerical algorithms for Bingham fluids [2,20,27,29,30,32]. However, very little research can be found in the literature regarding the rate of convergence of the numerical solution to the true continuous solution, that is the error estimate of these numerical methods. Error estimates are a critically important issue because they tells us how to control the error by appropriately choosing the grid sizes and other related parameters. This paper concerns the error estimates of a unsteady Bingham fluid modeled as a variational inequality due to Duvaut-Lions [16] and Glowinski [30]. The difficulty both in the analytical and numerical treatment of the mathematical model is due to the fact that it contains a nondifferentiable term. A common technique, called the regularization method, is to replace the non-differentiable term by a perturbed differentiable term which depends on a small regularization parameter ε. The regularization method effectively reduces the variational inequality to an equation (a regularized problem) which is much easier to cope with. This paper has achieved the following. (1) Error estimates are derived for a continuous time Galerkin method in suitable norms. (2) We give an estimate of the difference between the true solution and the regularized solution in terms of ε. (3) Some regularity properties for both regularized solution and the true solution are proved. (4) The error estimates for full discretization of the regularized problem using piecewise linear finite elements in space, and backward differencing in time are established for the first time by coupling the regularization parameter ε and the discretization parameters h and Δt. (5) We are able to improve our estimates in the one-dimensional case or under stronger regularity assumptions on the true solution. The estimates for the one-dimensional case are optimal and confirmed by numerical experiment. The estimates from (4) and (5) provide very important information on the measure of the error and give us a powerful mechanism to properly choose the parameters h, Δt and ε in order to control the error (see Corollary 4.4). The above estimates extend the error bounds derived in Glowinski, Lions and Trémolières [32] (chapter 5, pp. 348–404) for the stationary Bingham fluid to the time-dependent one, which is the main contribution of this paper.

We describe solutions of a three-dimensional stochastic advection-dispersion equation using a probabilistic collocation method (PCM) on sparse grids for several distributions of hydraulic conductivity. Three random distributions of log hydraulic conductivity are considered: uniform, Gaussian, and truncated Gaussian (beta). Log hydraulic conductivity is represented by a Karhunen-Loève (K-L) decomposition as a second-order random process with an exponential covariance function. The convergence of PCM has been demonstrated. It appears that the accuracy in both the mean and the standard deviation of PCM solutions can be improved by using the Jacobi-chaos representing the truncated Gaussian distribution rather than the Hermite-chaos for the Gaussian distribution.

The vertical and grooved walls of the enclosure are kept at constant low temperature while the top horizontal walls are thermally insulated and different thermal boundary conditions are set to the bottom horizontal walls. The fluid within the enclosure is initially assumed to be at rest and the initial temperature of the nanofluid is considered at low temperature. The governing equations representing the flow model are converted into dimensionless form using appropriate transformations and then solved with finite element method based on Galerkin weighted residual technique. The effects of pertinent parameters have been displayed graphically and discussed in terms of streamlines, isotherms, average Nusselt number, average temperature, mean velocity and mid height velocities, respectively. The results indicate that the heat transfer rate in terms of average Nusselt number increases with the increase in Rayleigh number and solid volume fraction of nanoparticales but decreases for increasing strength of magnetic field. Moreover, it is also found that the various thermal boundary conditions have significant effects on the flow and thermal fields inside the enclosure. In addition, the heat transfer rate accelerates significantly in presence of square grooves.

1709,Numerical investigation of variable viscosities and thermal stratification effects on MHD mixed convective heat and mass transfer past a porous wedge in the presence of a chemical reaction,"An analysis is presented to investigate the effects of variable viscosities and thermal stratification on the MHD mixed convective heat and mass transfer of a viscous, incompressible, and electrically conducting fluid past a porous wedge in the presence of a chemical reaction. The wall of the wedge is embedded in a uniform non-Darcian porous medium in order to allow for possible fluid wall suction or injection. The governing boundary layer equations are written into a dimensionless form by similarity transformations. The transformed coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations are solved numerically with finite difference methods. Numerical calculations up to the third order level of truncation are carried out for different values of dimensionless parameters. The results are presented graphically, and show that the flow field and other quantities of physical interest are significantly influenced by these parameters. The results are compared with those available in literature, and show excellent agreement.","I. Muhaimin1, Ramasamy Kandasamy1 & Azme B.

1710,A parameter-uniform numerical method for singularly perturbed Burgers’ equation,"In this article, we propose a parameter-uniformly convergent numerical method for singularly perturbed Burgers’ initial-boundary value problem. First, the Burgers’ partial differential equation is semi-discretized in time using Crank–Nicolson finite difference method to yield a set of singularly perturbed nonlinear ordinary differential equations in space. The resulting two-point boundary value nonlinear singularly perturbed problems are linearized using Newton quasilinearization technique, and then, we apply fitted operator finite difference method to exhibit the layer nature of the solution. It is shown that the method converges uniformly with respect to the perturbation parameter. Numerical experiments are carried out to confirm the parameter-uniform nature of the scheme which is second-order convergent in time and  first-order convergent in space.","Eshetu B.

Here, the rate of production is assumed to be a function of time and considered as a control variable. Also the demand is time dependent and known. The imprecise holding and production costs are assumed to be represented by fuzzy numbers which are transformed to corresponding interval numbers. Following interval mathematics, the objective function is changed to respective multi-objective functions and thus the single-objective problem is reduced to a multi-objective decision making(MODM) problem. The MODM problem is then again transformed to a single objective function with the help of weighted sum method and then solved using global criteria method, calculus method, the Kuhn–Tucker conditions and generalized reduced gradient(GRG) technique. The models have been illustrated by numerical data. The optimum results for different objectives are obtained for different types of production function.

1719,Numerical exploration of new features on three-dimensional transition of a cylinder wake,"The three-dimensional transition of the wake flow behind a circular cylinder is studied in detail by direct numerical simulations using 3D incompressible N-S equations for Reynolds number ranging from 200 to 300. New features and vortex dynamics of the 3D transition of the wake are found and investigated. At Re = 200, the flow pattern is characterized by mode A instability. However, the spanwise characteristic length of the cylinder determines the transition features. Particularly for the specific spanwise characteristic length linear stable mode may dominate the wake in place of mode A and determine the spanwise phase difference of the primary vortices shedding. At Re = 250 and 300 it is found that the streamwise vortices evolve into a new type of mode’“dual vortex pair mode” downstream. The streamwise vortex structures switch among mode A, mode B and dual vortex pair mode from near wake to downstream wake. At Re = 250, an independent low frequency f
m in addition to the vortex shedding frequency f
s is identified. Frequency coupling between f
m and f
s occurs. These result in the irregularity of the temporal signals and become a key feature in the transition of the wake. Based on the formation analysis of the streamwise vorticity in the vicinity of cylinder, it is suggested that mode A is caused by the emergence of the spanwise velocity due to three dimensionality of the incoming flow past the cylinder. Energy distribution on various wave numbers and the frequency variation in the wake are also described.","Guocan Ling1, Jun Xiong1,2 & Keqin Zhu",Science in China Series A: Mathematics,2004,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1360/04za0006,"cylinder,wake,3D transition,Fourier-spectral-spectral-element method,direct numerical simulation (DNS)"
1720,Numerical 2D models of consolidation of dense flocculated suspensions,"A mathematical 2D model for a consolidation process of a highly concentrated, flocculated suspension is developed. The suspension is treated as a mixture of a fluid and solid particles by an Eulerian two-phase fluid model. The suspension is characterized by constitutive relations correlating the stresses, interaction forces, and inter-particle forces to concentration and velocity gradients. This results in three empirical material functions: a permeability, a non-Newtonian viscosity and a non-reversible particle interaction pressure. Parameters in the models are fitted to experimental data. A simulation program using finite difference methods both in time and space is applied to one and two dimensional test cases. The effect of different viscosity models as well as the effect of shear on consolidation rate is studied. The results show that a shear thinning viscosity model yields a higher consolidation rate compared to a model that only depends on the volume fraction. It is also concluded that the size of the viscosity influences the time scale of the process and that the expected effect of shear on the process is not weil reproduced with any of the models.",Katarina Gustavsson1 & Jesper Oppelstrup,Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1011951614241,"consolidation,flocculated suspension,Eulerian two-fluid model,shear thinning,numerical simulations."

In the literature, considerable efforts have been devoted to the numerical computation or estimation of Peano constants, however, their discussions have mainly focused on the Peano kernels of some specific higher orders related to the degrees of the underlying error functionals. Limiting to such higher orders either requires certain smoothness of the approximated functions, which is not always fulfilled, or is not always the optimal choice for error estimates, even if the approximated functions are sufficiently smooth. Practical considerations in computing Peano constants for the full range of orders are given in this paper. Numerical examples are also given to demonstrate that much better error bounds can be derived while Peano constants of lower orders are considered.

1723,The spherical design algorithm in the numerical simulation of biological tissues with statistical fibre-reinforcement,"Nowadays, the description of complex physical systems, such as biological tissues, calls for highly detailed and accurate mathematical models. These, in turn, necessitate increasingly elaborate numerical methods as well as dedicated algorithms capable of resolving each detail which they account for. Especially when commercial software is used, the performance of the algorithms coded by the user must be tested and carefully assessed. In Computational Biomechanics, the Spherical Design Algorithm (SDA) is a widely used algorithm to model biological tissues that, like articular cartilage, are described as composites reinforced by statistically oriented collagen fibres. The purpose of the present work is to analyse the performances of the SDA, which we implement in a commercial software for several sets of integration points (referred to as “spherical designs”), and compare the results with those determined by using an appropriate set of points proposed in this manuscript. As terms for comparison we take the results obtained by employing the integration scheme Integral, available in Matlab\(^{{\textregistered }}\). For the numerical simulations, we study a well-documented benchmark test on articular cartilage, known as ‘unconfined compression test’. The reported numerical results highlight the influence of the fibres on the elasticity and permeability of this tissue. Moreover, some technical issues of the SDA (such as the choice of the quadrature points and their position in the integration domain) are proposed and discussed.",Melania Carfagna1 & Alfio Grillo,Computing and Visualization in Science,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00791-017-0278-6,"Spherical design algorithm,Quadrature methods,Fibre-reinforced materials,Finite element method"

For stationary convection, the stable solute gradient parameter and the rotation have stabilizing effects on the system, whereas the magnetic field and the medium permeability have stabilizing or destabilizing effects on the system under certain conditions. The Hall current in the presence of rotation has stabilizing effects for sufficiently large Taylor numbers, whereas in the absence of rotation, the Hall current always has destabilizing effects. These effects have also been shown graphically. The viscoelastic effects disappear for stationary convection. The stable solute parameter, the rotation, the medium permeability, the magnetic field parameter, the Hall current, and the vis-coelasticity introduce oscillatory modes into the system, which are non-existent in their absence. The sufficient conditions for the non-existence of overstability are also obtained.","S. Kumar1, V. Sharma2 & K.

This paper describes an algorithm for the calculation of such stability boundaries, for the case of periodic travelling wave solutions of spatially extended local dynamical systems. The algorithm is based on numerical continuation of the spectrum. It is implemented in a fully automated way by the software package wavetrain, and two examples of its use are presented.

The scheme is derived from a first-order approximation to the original problem with a small deviating argument. It is shown here that, in the limit, as the deviating argument tends to zero, the difference scheme converges to a one-sided approximation to the original singularly perturbed equation in conservation form. The limiting scheme is shown to be stable on any uniform grid. Therefore, no advantage arises from using the deviating argument, and the most accurate and efficient results are obtained with the deviation at its zero limit.",N. K.

The key advantage of the proposed method over the widely used Fourier split-step method is that in the new method, numerical instability at high wavenumbers is strongly suppressed. This allows one to use time steps that considerably exceed the instability threshold, which leads to a proportional reduction of the computational time. Moreover, we introduce a technique that eliminates numerical instability at low-to-moderate wavenumbers that is common for methods based on the leapfrog scheme. We illustrate the performance of the proposed method with examples from two applications areas: deterministic wave turbulence and solitary waves.","T. I. Lakoba

1728,Transparent boundary conditions and numerical computation for singularly perturbed telegraph equation on unbounded domain,"In this paper, we study the numerical solution for the singularly perturbed telegraph equation (SPTE) on unbounded domain. Firstly, we investigate the first consistent effective asymptotic expansion for the solution of SPTE by the asymptotic analysis and obtain that the solutions of SPTE have an initial layer near \(t=0\). Next, we introduce the artificial boundaries \(\varGamma _{\pm }\) to get a finite computational domain \(\varOmega _0\) and derive the transparent boundary conditions on \(\varGamma _{\pm }\) for SPTE. Hence, we can reduce the original problem to an initial-boundary value problem (IBVP) on the bounded domain \(\varOmega _0\), and then the equivalence between the original problem and the IBVP on \(\varOmega _0\) is proved. In addition, we propose a Crank–Nicolson Galerkin scheme to solve the reduced problem. Furthermore, we use the exponential wave integrator method to deal with the initial layer. We also analyze the stability and convergence of the Crank–Nicolson Galerkin scheme. Finally, some numerical examples validate our theoretical results and show the efficiency and reliability of the transparent boundary conditions and the Crank–Nicolson Galerkin scheme.

Sensitivity analysis is used to find how many terms of the polynomial basis functions are suitable for the source term approximation. Results show that for different boundary conditions, different numbers of the basis functions are appropriate, without considering functional forms of the source term.

1731,A Novel Class of Symmetric and Nonsymmetric Periodizing Variable Transformations for Numerical Integration,"Variable transformations for numerical integration have been used for improving the accuracy of the trapezoidal rule. Specifically, one first transforms the integral \({I[f]=\int^1_0f(x) dx}\) via a variable transformation \({x=\phi(t)}\) that maps [0,1] to itself, and then approximates the resulting transformed integral \({I[f]= \int^1_0 f\big(\phi(t)\big)\phi'(t) dt}\) by the trapezoidal rule. In this work, we propose a new class of symmetric and nonsymmetric variable transformations which we denote \({\mathcal{T}_{r,s}}\) , where r and s are positive scalars assigned by the user. A simple representative of this class is \({\phi(t)=(sin\frac{\pi}{2}t)^r/[(sin\frac{\pi}{2}t)^r+(\cos\frac{\pi}{2}t)^s]}\) . We show that, in case \({f\in C^\infty[0,1]}\) , or \({\in C^\infty(0,1)}\) but has algebraic (endpoint) singularities at x = 0 and/or x = 1, the trapezoidal rule on the transformed integral produces exceptionally high accuracies for special values of r and s. In particular, when \({f\in C^\infty[0,1]}\) and we employ \({\phi\in{\mathcal T}_{r,r}}\) , the error in the approximation is (i) O(h
r) for arbitrary r and (ii) O(h

This strategy yields a convergent sequence of approximations as discretization and penalty parameter vanish. The proof generalizes to a large class of minimization problems and is of interest beyond the scope of thin-film micromagnetics.","Samuel Ferraz-Leite1, Jens Markus Melenk2 & Dirk Praetorius",Numerische Mathematik,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-012-0454-z,"65K05,65K15,49M20"

We review some newly developed theories on solvability and convergence. The rates of convergence of these variations of Kansa’s method are examined and verified in arbitrary–precision computations. Numerical examples confirm with the theories that the modified Kansa’s method converges faster than the interpolant to the solution; that is, exponential convergence for the multiquadric and Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs). Some numerical algorithms are proposed for efficiency and accuracy in practical applications of Kansa’s method. In double–precision, even for very large RBF shape parameters, we show that the modified Kansa’s method, through a subspace selection using a greedy algorithm, can produce acceptable approximate solutions. A benchmark algorithm is used to verify the optimality of the selection process.","Cheng-Feng Lee1, Leevan Ling2 & Robert Schaback",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-008-9071-x,"Radial basis function,Kansa’s method,Convergence,Error bounds,Linear optimization,Effective condition number,High precision computation"

In this paper we study, from a numerical point of view, some aspects of stability of solitary-wave solutions of the Bona–Smith systems of equations. These systems are a family of Boussinesq-type equations and were originally proposed for modelling the two-way propagation of one-dimensional long waves of small amplitude in an open channel of water of constant depth. We study numerically the behavior of solitary waves of these systems under small and large perturbations with the aim of illuminating their long-time asymptotic stability properties and, in the case of large perturbations, examining, among other, phenomena of possible blow-up of the perturbed solutions in finite time.

1744,A parameter-uniform numerical scheme for the parabolic singularly perturbed initial boundary value problems with large time delay,"A numerical scheme for a class of singularly perturbed parabolic partial differential equation with the time delay on a rectangular domain in the x–t plane is constructed. The presence of the perturbation parameter in the second-order space derivative gives rise to parabolic boundary layer(s) on one (or both) of the lateral side(s) of the rectangle. Thus the classical numerical methods on the uniform mesh are inadequate and fail to give good accuracy and results in large oscillations as the perturbation parameter approaches zero. To overcome this drawback a numerical method comprising the Crank–Nicolson finite difference method consisting of a midpoint upwind finite difference scheme on a fitted piecewise-uniform mesh of \(N\times M\) elements condensing in the boundary layer region is constructed. A priori explicit bounds on the solution of the problem and its derivatives which are useful for the error analysis of the numerical method are established. To establish the parameter-uniform convergence of the proposed method an extensive amount of analysis is carried out. It is shown that the proposed difference scheme is second-order accurate in the temporal direction and the first-order (up to a logarithmic factor) accurate in the spatial direction. To validate the theoretical results, the method is applied to two test problems. The performance of the method is demonstrated by calculating the maximum absolute errors and experimental orders of convergence. Since the exact solutions of the test problems are not known, the maximum absolute errors are obtained by using double mesh principle. The numerical results show that the proposed method is simply applicable, accurate, efficient and robust.",Devendra Kumar1 & Parvin Kumari,Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computing,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12190-018-1174-z,"Delay partial differential equations,Time delay,Singular perturbation,Piecewise-uniform mesh,Parabolic boundary layers,Parameter-uniform convergence"

However, rigorous analysis of the actual versus theoretical error properties of these non-linear numerical methods is difficult. We use a bandwidth-optimized WENO scheme to conduct direct numerical simulations of two- and three-dimensional decaying isotropic turbulence, and we evaluate the performance of quantitative indicators of local WENO adaptation behavior within the resulting flow fields. One aspect of this assessment is the demarcation of shock-containing and smooth regions where the WENO method should, respectively, engage its adaptation mechanism and revert to its linear optimal stencil. Our results show that these indicators, when synthesized properly, can provide valuable quantitative information suitable for statistical characterization.",Ellen M. Taylor1 & M.

Through various numerical examples on a type of layer-adapted grids (Shishkin grids), we show that the mesh adaptivity driven by accuracy alone cannot stabilize the scheme in all cases. Furthermore the numerical approximation is sensitive to the symmetry of the grid in the region where the solution is smooth. On the basis of these two observations, we develop a multilevel-homotopic-adaptive finite element method (MHAFEM) by combining streamline diffusion finite element method, anisotropic mesh adaptation, and the homotopy of the diffusion coefficient. We use numerical experiments to demonstrate that MHAFEM can efficiently capture boundary or interior layers and produce accurate solutions.","Pengtao Sun1, Long Chen2 & Jinchao Xu",Journal of Scientific Computing,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-009-9337-6,"Convection-dominated convection-diffusion-reaction problem,Layer-adapted Shishkin grids,Streamline diffusion finite element,Anisotropic adaptive mesh,Multilevel homotopic adaptive finite element method"

1753,"On the Self-Similar, Wright-Function Exact Solution for Early-Time, Anomalous Diffusion in Random Networks: Comparison with Numerical Results","Recently, Zhang and Padrino in (Int J Multiph Flow 92:70–81, 2017) derived an equation for diffusion in random networks consisting of junction pockets and connecting channels by applying the ensemble average method to the mass conservation principle. The resulting integro-differential equation was solved numerically using the finite volume method for the test case of one-dimensional diffusion in the half-line. For early time, they found that the numerical predictions of pocket mass density depend on the similarity variable \(x t^{-1/4}\), describing sub-diffusion, instead of \(x t^{-1/2}\) as in ordinary diffusion. They argue that the sub-diffusive trend is the result of the time required to establish a linear concentration profile inside a channel. By theoretical analysis of the diffusion equation for small time, they confirmed this finding. Nevertheless, they did not present an exact solution for the small-time limit to compare with. Here, starting with their small-time leading order diffusion equation in (x, t) space, we use elements of fractional calculus to cast it into a form for which an analytical solution has been given in the literature for the same boundary and initial conditions in terms of the Wright function (Gorenflo et al. in J Comput Appl Math 118(1):175–191, 2000). This solution, in turn, is written in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions, readily available in calculus software packages. Comparing predictions from the exact solution with Zhang and Padrino’s numerical results leads to excellent agreement, serving as validation of their numerical approach.","Juan C. Padrino

Additionally, we obtain the value of the insurance associated to the contract. The mortgage value is understood as the discounted value of the future monthly payments. The mathematical model to obtain the mortgage price is posed in terms of a sequence of complementarity problems associated with partial differential equations (PDEs). One of the main innovative aspects is the consideration of a floating interest rate, which is linked to an index and fixed for each year of the loan life. The model for the value of the insurance is also posed. In this setting, we propose appropriate numerical methods to solve the models, which are mainly based on a Lagrange–Galerkin discretization of the PDE in time and space, jointly with an augmented Lagrangian active set method to deal with the complementarity formulation.

It is shown that in a symmetric three-layer plate, a flexural and torsion interaction arises generating mutual transformations of the natural forms of the coupled vibration modes if at least one of its natural forms in the plate directions is characterized by an even number of quarter-wavelengths, and another natural form is characterized by an odd number of quarter-wavelengths. A flexural–flexural interaction arises in an asymmetric unsupported three-layer plate and generates mutual transformations of the natural forms of coupled vibration modes in two mutually orthogonal planes if both natural forms are characterized by either an even or an odd number of quarter-wavelengths in the main directions of the plate.

1760,Numerical aspects of hydro-mechanical coupling of fluid-filled fractures using hybrid-dimensional element formulations and non-conformal meshes,"In the field of porous and fractured media, subsurface flow provides insight into the characteristics of fluid storage and properties connected to underground matter and heat transport. Subsurface flow is precisely described by many diffusion based models in the literature. However, diffusion-based models lack to reproduce important hydro-mechanical coupling phenomena like inverse water-level fluctuations (Noordbergum effect). In theory, contemporary modeling approaches, such as direct numerical simulations (DNS) of surface-coupled fluid-solid (fracture) interactions or coarse-grained continuum approaches like Biot’s theory, are capable of capturing such phenomena. Nevertheless, during modeling processes of fractures with high aspect ratios, DNS methods with the explicit discretization of the fluid domain fail, and coarse-grained continuum approaches require a non-linear formulation for the fracture deformation since large deformation can be reached easily within fractures. Hence a hybrid-dimensional approach uses a parabolic velocity profile to avoid an explicit discretization of the fluid domain within the fracture. For fracture flow, the primary variable is the pressure field only, and the fracture domain is reduced by one dimension. The interaction between the fracture and the surrounding matrix domain, respectively, is realized by modified balance equations. The coupled system is numerically stiff when fluids are described with a low compressibility modulus. Two algorithms are proposed within this work, namely the weak coupling scheme, which uses an implicit staggered-iterative algorithm to find the residual state and the strong coupling scheme which directly couples both domains by implementing interface elements. In the course of this work, a consistent implementation scheme for the coupling of hybrid-dimensional elements with a surrounding bulk matrix is proposed and validated and tested throughout different numerical experiments.","Patrick Schmidt

Such a separate numerical treatment for the illposedness and nonlinearity of the inverse problem makes the numerical implementation of the proposed method very easy and fast since there only involves the solution of a small scale minimization problem with one unknown function in the nonlinear optimization step for determining the shape of the sound-hard obstacle. Another particular feature of the method is that it can reproduce the shape of an unknown hard target efficiently from the knowledge of only one Fourier coefficient of the far-field pattern. Moreover, a two-step adaptive iteration algorithm was presented to implement numerically the nonlinear optimization scheme. Numerical experiments for several two-dimensional sound-hard scatterers having a variety of shapes provide an independent verification of the effectiveness and practicality of the inversion scheme.","You Yun-xiang Professor, Doctor1 & Miao Guo-ping",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02438112,"acoustic scattering,inverse problem,far-field pattern"

1770,On numerical optimization theory of infinite kernel learning,"In Machine Learning algorithms, one of the crucial issues is the representation of the data. As the given data source become heterogeneous and the data are large-scale, multiple kernel methods help to classify “nonlinear data”. Nevertheless, the finite combinations of kernels are limited up to a finite choice. In order to overcome this discrepancy, a novel method of  “infinite”  kernel combinations is proposed with the help of infinite and semi-infinite programming regarding all elements in kernel space. Looking at all infinitesimally fine convex combinations of the kernels from the infinite kernel set, the margin is maximized subject to an infinite number of constraints with a compact index set and an additional (Riemann–Stieltjes) integral constraint due to the combinations. After a parametrization in the space of probability measures, it becomes semi-infinite. We adapt well-known numerical methods to our infinite kernel learning model and analyze the existence of solutions and convergence for the given algorithms. We implement our new algorithm called “infinite” kernel learning (IKL) on heterogenous data sets by using exchange method and conceptual reduction method, which are well known numerical techniques from solve semi-infinite programming. The results show that our IKL approach improves the classifaction accuracy efficiently on heterogeneous data compared to classical one-kernel approaches.","S. Özöğür-Akyüz1 & G.-W.

1778,Numerical Modeling of Degenerate Equations in Porous Media Flow,"In this paper is introduced a new numerical formulation for solving degenerate nonlinear coupled convection dominated parabolic systems in problems of flow and transport in porous media by means of a mixed finite element and an operator splitting technique, which, in turn, is capable of simulating the flow of a distinct number of fluid phases in different porous media regions. This situation naturally occurs in practical applications, such as those in petroleum reservoir engineering and groundwater transport. To illustrate the modelling problem at hand, we consider a nonlinear three-phase porous media flow model in one- and two-space dimensions, which may lead to the existence of a simultaneous one-, two- and three-phase flow regions and therefore to a degenerate convection dominated parabolic system. Our numerical formulation can also be extended for the case of three space dimensions. As a consequence of the standard mixed finite element approach for this flow problem the resulting linear algebraic system is singular. By using an operator splitting combined with mixed finite element, and a decomposition of the domain into different flow regions, compatibility conditions are obtained to bypass the degeneracy in order to the degenerate convection dominated parabolic system of equations be numerically tractable without any mathematical trick to remove the singularity, i.e., no use of a parabolic regularization. Thus, by using this procedure, we were able to write the full nonlinear system in an appropriate way in order to obtain a nonsingular system for its numerical solution. The robustness of the proposed method is verified through a large set of high-resolution numerical experiments of nonlinear transport flow problems with degenerating diffusion conditions and by means of a numerical convergence study.",Eduardo Abreu1 & Duilio Conceição,Journal of Scientific Computing,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-012-9653-0,"Degenerate convection-diffusion,Operator splitting,Mixed finite elements,Finite volume central scheme,Porous media,Three-phase flow"

The indefiniteness requires special treatment. The sub-blocks used in the algorithm correspond to problems on a coarse grid and some overlapping subdomains and is based on a similar partition used in an algorithm of Dryja and Widlund for standard elliptic problems. If there is sufficient overlap between the subdomains, the algorithm converges with a rate independent of the mesh size, the number of subdomains and discontinuities of the coefficients.

The convergence of the computed characteristic values is of infinite order with respect to the pseudospectral discretization and of finite order with respect to the spectral one.

The method is used for solving some famous NPDEs, such as the generalized Burgers–Fisher equation, the Fisher equation, the Burgers–Huxley equation, and the modified KdV–Burgers equation. First, the QLM converts the nonlinear equation to a sequence of linear partial differential equations (LPDEs), and then these LPDEs are solved using the B-GFCFs collocation method. In the time-fractional case, we use the Caputo fractional derivative operational matrix to get rid of the fractional derivative. An algorithm is presented by examining its complexity order for the method, as also, the convergence analysis, error analysis, and error estimate for the method are briefly investigated.

The transmission conditions between the interior and exterior domain are imposed by a time-dependent boundary integral equation coupled to the wave equation in the interior domain. We give a full discretization by finite elements and leapfrog time-stepping in the interior, and by boundary elements and convolution quadrature on the boundary. The direct coupling becomes stable on adding a stabilization term on the boundary.

1795,An ADMM numerical approach to linear parabolic state constrained optimal control problems,"Optimal control problems arising from systems modeled by linear parabolic equations may be difficult for both theoretical analysis and algorithmic design. For the case where there are additional constraints on the state variables, restrictive regularity assumptions are usually required to guarantee the existence of the associated Lagrange multiplier and thus some regularization type methods such as the Moreau–Yosida and Lavrentiev methods have been discussed in the literature. In this article, we study the application of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to linear parabolic state constrained optimal control problems, and propose an ADMM numerical approach. We prove the convergence of the ADMM algorithm without any existence or regularity assumption on the Lagrange multiplier, and estimate its worst-case convergence rate in both the ergodic and nonergodic senses. An important feature of the ADMM approach is that it decouples the state constraints and the parabolic optimal control problems inside each iteration. We show the efficiency of the ADMM approach by testing some control problems in two space dimensions.","Roland Glowinski1,2, Yongcun Song3 & Xiaoming Yuan",Numerische Mathematik,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-020-01104-4,"49J20,90C25,65K05"
1796,"A Non-local Cross-Diffusion Model of Population Dynamics II: Exact, Approximate, and Numerical Traveling Waves in Single- and Multi-species Populations","We study traveling waves in a non-local cross-diffusion-type model, where organisms move along gradients in population densities. Such models are valuable for understanding waves of migration and invasion and how directed motion can impact such scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate the emergence of traveling wave solutions, studying properties of both planar and radial wave fronts in one- and two-species variants of the model. We compute exact traveling wave solutions in the purely diffusive case and then perturb these solutions to analytically capture the influence directed motion has on these exact solutions. Using linear stability analysis, we find that the minimum wavespeeds correspond to the purely diffusive case, but numerical simulations suggest that advection can in general increase or decrease the observed wavespeed substantially, which allows a single species to more rapidly move into unoccupied resource-rich spatial regions or modify the speed of an invasion for two populations. We also find interesting effects from the non-local interactions in the model, suggesting that single species invasions can be enhanced with stronger non-locality, but that invasion of a competitive species may be slowed due to this non-local effect. Finally, we simulate pattern formation behind waves of invasion, showing that directed motion can have substantial impacts not only on wavespeed but also on the existence and structure of emergent patterns, as predicted in the first part of our study (Taylor et al. in Bull Math Biol, 2020).","Andrew L.

1797,Numerical Estimation of Balanced and Falling States for Constrained Legged Systems,"Instability and risk of fall during standing and walking are common challenges for biped robots. While existing criteria from state-space dynamical systems approach or ground reference points are useful in some applications, complete system models and constraints have not been taken into account for prediction and indication of fall for general legged robots. In this study, a general numerical framework that estimates the balanced and falling states of legged systems is introduced. The overall approach is based on the integration of joint-space and Cartesian-space dynamics of a legged system model. The full-body constrained joint-space dynamics includes the contact forces and moments term due to current foot (or feet) support and another term due to altered contact configuration. According to the refined notions of balanced, falling, and fallen, the system parameters, physical constraints, and initial/final/boundary conditions for balancing are incorporated into constrained nonlinear optimization problems to solve for the velocity extrema (representing the maximum perturbation allowed to maintain balance without changing contacts) in the Cartesian space at each center-of-mass (COM) position within its workspace. The iterative algorithm constructs the stability boundary as a COM state-space partition between balanced and falling states. Inclusion in the resulting six-dimensional manifold is a necessary condition for a state of the given system to be balanced under the given contact configuration, while exclusion is a sufficient condition for falling. The framework is used to analyze the balance stability of example systems with various degrees of complexities. The manifold for a 1-degree-of-freedom (DOF) legged system is consistent with the experimental and simulation results in the existing studies for specific controller designs. The results for a 2-DOF system demonstrate the dependency of the COM state-space partition upon joint-space configuration (elbow-up vs. elbow-down). For both 1- and 2-DOF systems, the results are validated in simulation environments. Finally, the manifold for a biped walking robot is constructed and illustrated against its single-support walking trajectories. The manifold identified by the proposed framework for any given legged system can be evaluated beforehand as a system property and serves as a map for either a specified state or a specific controller’s performance.","Carlotta Mummolo1, Luigi Mangialardi2 & Joo H.

1799,Efficient alternating direction implicit numerical approaches for multi-dimensional distributed-order fractional integro differential problems,"This paper proposes the alternating direction implicit (ADI) numerical approaches for computing the solution of multi-dimensional distributed-order fractional integrodifferential problems. The proposed method discretizes the unknown solution in two stages. First, the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral term and the distributed-order time-fractional derivative are discretized with the help of the second-order convolution quadrature and the weighted and shifted Grünwald formula, respectively. Second, the spatial discretization is obtained by the general centered finite difference (FD) technique. At the same time, the ADI algorithms are devised for reducing the computational burden. Additionally, the convergence analysis of proposed ADI FD schemes is analyzed in detail through the energy method. Finally, two numerical examples highlight the accuracy of the proposed method and verify the theoretical formulations.

1800,A numerical method for a nonlocal diffusion equation with additive noise,"We consider a nonlocal evolution equation representing the continuum limit of a large ensemble of interacting particles on graphs forced by noise. The two principle ingredients of the continuum model are a nonlocal term and a Q-Wiener process describing the interactions among the particles in the network and stochastic forcing, respectively. The network connectivity is given by a square integrable function called a graphon. We prove that the initial value problem for the continuum model is well-posed. Further, we construct semidiscrete (discrete in space and continuous in time) and fully discrete schemes for the nonlocal model. The former is obtained by a discontinuous Galerkin method and the latter is based on further discretizing time using the Euler–Maruyama method. We prove convergence and estimate the rate of convergence in each case. For the semidiscrete scheme, the rate of convergence is expressed in terms of the regularity of the graphon, the Q-Wiener process, and the initial data. We work in generalized Lipschitz spaces, which allows us to treat models with data of lower regularity. This is important for applications as many interesting types of connectivity, including small-world and power-law, are expressed by graphons that are not smooth. The error analysis of the fully discrete scheme, on the other hand, reveals that for some models common in applied science, one has a higher speed of convergence than that predicted by the standard estimates for the Euler–Maruyama method. The rate of convergence analysis is supplemented with detailed numerical experiments, which are consistent with our analytical results. As a by-product, this work presents a rigorous justification for taking continuum limit for a large class of interacting dynamical systems on graphs subject to noise.","Georgi S. Medvedev

1801,Numerical solution of doubly singular boundary value problems by finite difference method,"In this paper, we propose a computational technique based on a combination of optimal homotopy analysis method (OHAM) and an iterative finite difference method (FDM) for a class of derivative-dependent doubly singular boundary value problems: $$\begin{aligned} (p(x)y^{\prime })^{\prime }= & {} q(x)f(x,y(x),y^{\prime }(x)),\quad 0\le x\le 1, \\ y^{\prime }(0)= & {} 0,~~ {\alpha }y(1)+{\beta }y^{\prime }(1)=B \end{aligned}$$or $$\begin{aligned} y(0)=A,~~{\alpha }y(1)+{\beta }y^{\prime }(1)=B. \end{aligned}$$The principal idea of this approach is to decompose the domain of the problem \(D=[0,1]\) into two subdomains as \(D=D_{1}\cup D_{2}=[0,\gamma ]\cup [\gamma ,1]\) (\(\gamma \) is the vicinity of the singularity). In the first domain \(D_{1},\) we use OHAM to overcome the singularity behaviour at \(x=0\). In the second domain \(D_{2}\), a FDM is designed for solving the resulting regular boundary value problem. Convergence analysis of the method is carried out. Three nonlinear examples are considered to demonstrate the performance and accuracy of the proposed method. It is shown that the computational order of convergence of the FDM is two.","Pradip Roul

1802,On Mathematical and Numerical Modelling of Multiphysics Wave Propagation with Polytopal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods: a Review,"In this work we review discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods on polytopal grids (PolydG) for the numerical simulation of multiphysics wave propagation phenomena in heterogeneous media. In particular, we address wave phenomena in elastic, poro-elastic, and poro-elasto-acoustic materials. Wave propagation is modeled by using either the elastodynamics equation in the elastic domain, the acoustics equations in the acoustic domain and the low-frequency Biot’s equations in the poro-elastic one. The coupling between different models is realized by means of (physically consistent) transmission conditions, weakly imposed at the interface between the subdomains. For all models configuration, we introduce and analyse the PolydG semi-discrete formulation, which is then coupled with suitable time marching schemes. For the semi-discrete problem, we present the stability analysis and derive a-priori error estimates in a suitable energy norm. A wide set of two-dimensional verification tests with manufactured solutions are presented in order to validate the error analysis. Examples of physical interest are also shown to demonstrate the capability of the proposed methods.","Paola F. Antonietti

For singularly perturbed problems, however, generally it is known that the perturbation term produces a bad effect on the a priori error estimates, i.e., leads to a large constant, if we use the usual approximation methods. In this paper, we propose some verification algorithms for solutions of singularly perturbed problems with nonlinearity by using the constant obtained in the a priori error estimates based on the exponential fitting method with Green’s function. Some numerical examples which confirm us the effectiveness of our method are presented.","Kouji Hashimoto1, Ryohei Abe1, Mitsuhiro T.

The two opposite horizontal walls move in parallel and antiparallel motions, while the left vertical sidewall moves upwards and downwards. The right vertical sidewall is stationary. A detailed analysis of the fluid flow has been carried out with the finite volume method for a Reynolds number up to 5000 using a fine mesh resolution, whereas the coupled algorithm has been employed to handle the pressure–velocity coupling. The results are displayed in terms of stream-function contours, fluid properties, and velocity profiles and have indicated a good agreement with the set of literature. Among the three driving processes considered, a most complex topological flow pattern has been shown with the antiparallel-downwards case. This is embodied by a significant amount of robustness induced in three opposing directions leading to multiple changes of streamline patterns. This is accompanied by high rotation rates of secondary vortices in the near-wall regions.",El Amin Azzouz1 & Samir Houat,International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40819-022-01314-4,"Lid-driven cavity flow,Finite volume method,Steady solution,Reynolds number"

The boundary location of the cavity consists of non-uniform heating of bottom wall whilst the two vertical walls are maintained at a cold temperature and the top wall is thermal insulated. For the simulation purpose, wide range of parameters, such as, Hartmann number (Ha = 50), Prandtl number (0.026 ≤ Pr ≤ 1000), Rayleigh number (103 ≤ Ra ≤ 106) and Darcy number (10−5 ≤ Da ≤ 10−1) are used in the cavity with various AR. The study demonstrated that the aforementioned parameters have strong influence on the stream functions and isotherms for different AR. A stronger flow circulation is observed for higher Ra and Da. Besides these, a symmetry for fluid flow simulations and isotherm contours are viewed. The result too unveils that the heat transfer rates as well as local and average Nusselt numbers strongly depend on various AR and abovementioned parameters.","Muhammad Sajjad Hossain1, Md.

Using the Taylor series formula, the time variable is discretized, which converts the nonlinear model into a sequence of linearized problems continuous with respect to spatial variable. Then, a spectral collocation procedure based on novel shifted Morgan-Voyce (SMV) is applied to solve the resulting discretized equation at each time step yielding a linear algebraic system of equations. A rigorous error analysis shows that the proposed approach is uniformly convergent of order \(\mathcal {O}(\Delta \tau ^2+N^{-2})\), where \(\Delta \tau \) is the time step and N is the number of SMV basis. Three test examples including Allen–Cahn and Newell–Whitehead equations are provided   to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the presented hybrid collocation algorithm.

1809,Detecting minimum energy states and multi-stability in nonlocal advection–diffusion models for interacting species,"Deriving emergent patterns from models of biological processes is a core concern of mathematical biology. In the context of partial differential equations, these emergent patterns sometimes appear as local minimisers of a corresponding energy functional. Here we give methods for determining the qualitative structure of local minimum energy states of a broad class of multi-species nonlocal advection–diffusion models, recently proposed for modelling the spatial structure of ecosystems. We show that when each pair of species respond to one another in a symmetric fashion (i.e. via mutual avoidance or mutual attraction, with equal strength), the system admits an energy functional that decreases in time and is bounded below. This suggests that the system will eventually reach a local minimum energy steady state, rather than fluctuating in perpetuity. We leverage this energy functional to develop tools, including a novel application of computational algebraic geometry, for making conjectures about the number and qualitative structure of local minimum energy solutions. These conjectures give a guide as to where to look for numerical steady state solutions, which we verify through numerical analysis. Our technique shows that even with two species, multi-stability with up to four classes of local minimum energy states can emerge. The associated dynamics include spatial sorting via aggregation and repulsion both within and between species. The emerging spatial patterns include a mixture of territory-like segregation as well as narrow spike-type solutions. Overall, our study reveals a general picture of rich multi-stability in systems of moving and interacting species.","Valeria Giunta

The method can be used to solve the integro-differential equation including fractional integral or fractional derivative in a long history. The difficulty of storing all history data is overcome and the error can be controlled. As application, motion equations governing the dynamical behavior of a viscoelastic Timoshenko beam with fractional derivative constitutive relation are given. The dynamical response of the beam subjected to a periodic excitation is studied by using the separation variables method. Then the new numerical method is used to solve a class of weakly singular Volterra integro-differential equations which are applied to describe the dynamical behavior of viscoelastic beams with fractional derivative constitutive relations. The analytical and unmerical results are compared. It is found that they are very close.","Zhu Zheng-you1,2, Li Gen-guo4 & Cheng Chang-jun1,",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02439616,"fractional calculus,numerical method,fractional derivative constitutive relation,weakly singular Volterra integro-differential equation"

The aim is to broaden the understanding of the synergistic effects of harvesting and insect infestation on the age structure of the forests and the harvesting benefit. In the first part of this study, we consider different scenarios of the forest infestation by beetles and observe that the quantitative age profile of the forest depends significantly on whether the beetle population is in its endemic or epidemic states. In the second part, we also include harvesting of the forest trees and analyze two different harvesting strategies: cutting all trees older than a certain age, and cutting a fixed proportion of trees older than a certain age. Numerical simulations are implemented to determine the optimal cutting age for both harvesting strategies. The numerical simulations reveal that, independent of the steady state of the beetle population (that is, no beetles, endemic or epidemic state) clear cutting all trees older than a given age provides a higher harvesting benefit. Our numerical simulations further indicate that to obtain a fixed harvesting yield, a forest under a beetle epidemic state has to be cut at a younger age than if the forest were at an endemic beetle state or a no-beetle state.","M.

1825,Efficient error control in numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and optimal interpolating variable-stepsize peer methods,"Automatic global error control of numerical schemes is examined. A new approach to this problem is presented. Namely, the problem is reformulated so that the global error is controlled by the numerical method itself rather than by the user. This makes it possible to find numerical solutions satisfying various accuracy requirements in a single run, which so far was considered unrealistic. On the other hand, the asymptotic equality of local and global errors, which is the basic condition of the new method for efficiently controlling the global error, leads to the concept of double quasi-consistency. This requirement cannot be satisfied within the classical families of numerical methods. However, the recently proposed peer methods include schemes with this property. There exist computational procedures based on these methods and polynomial interpolation of fairly high degree that find the numerical solution in a single run. If the integration stepsize is sufficiently small, the error of this solution does not exceed the prescribed tolerance. The theoretical conclusions of this paper are supported by the numerical results obtained for test problems with known solutions.",R. Weiner1 & G. Yu.

By the inverse transform, the problem is converted into an integral representation in the complex plane, and then computed by a suitable quadrature formula. The numerical scheme is applied to a class of linear and nonlinear Volterra integral equations of convolution type with highly oscillatory kernels and some of the obtained results are compared with the methods available in the literature. The main advantage of the present scheme is the transformation of highly oscillatory problem to non-oscillatory and simple problem. So, a large class of similar integral equations having highly oscillatory kernels can be approximated very effectively.",M. Uddin1 & A.

A solid elastically supported airfoil with two degrees of freedom, which can rotate around the elastic axis and oscillate in the vertical direction, is considered. The numerical simulation consists of the stabilized finite element treatment of the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) approach, the use of turbulence models and the solution of the system of ordinary differential equations describing the airfoil motion. The time dependent computational domain and a moving grid are taken into account with the aid of the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) formulation of the Navier–Stokes equations. High Reynolds numbers up to 106 require to use a suitable stabilization of the finite element discretization and the application of a turbulence model. We apply the algebraic turbulence model, which was designed by Baldwin and Lomax and modified by Rostand. The developed technique was tested by the simulation of flow past a flat rigid plate and the computation of pressure distribution around a rotating airfoil with prescribed motion. Finally, the method was applied to the simulation of flow induced airfoil vibrations.","Lenka Dubcová1, Miloslav Feistauer1, Jaromír Horáček2 & …Petr Sváček",Computing and Visualization in Science,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00791-008-0091-3,"Aeroelasticity,Finite element method,ALE formulation,Algebraic turbulence models,Flow induced airfoil vibrations"

The electric double layers and electroosmosis are important flow-electricity interaction phenomena. This paper presents a thickness-averaged model to solve three-dimensional complex electroosmotic flows in a wide-shallow microchannel/chamber combined (MCC) chip based on the Navier-Stokes equations for the flow field and the Poisson equation to the electric field. Behaviors of the electroosmotic flow, the electric field, and the pressure are analyzed. The quantitative effects of the wall charge density (or the zeta potential) and the applied electric field on the electroosmotic flow rate are investigated. The two-dimensional thickness-averaged flow model greatly simplifies the three-dimensional computation of the complex electroosmotic flows, and correctly reflects the electrookinetic effects of the wall charge on the flow. The numerical results indicate that the electroosmotic flow rate of the thickness-averaged model agrees well with that of the three-dimensional slip-boundary flow model. The flow streamlines and pressure distribution of these two models are in qualitative agreement.","Bo Chen

1843,The use of Richardson extrapolation for the numerical solution of low Mach number flow in confined regions,"We use artificial compressibility together with Richardson extrapolation in the Mach numberM as a method for solving the time dependent Navier-Stokes equation for very low Mach number flow and for incompressible flow. The question of what boundary conditions one should use for low Mach number flow, especially at inflow and outflow boundaries, is investigated theoretically, and boundary layer suppressing boundary conditions are derived. For the case of linearization around a constant flow we show that the low Mach number solution will converge with the rateO(M2) to the true incompressible solution, provided that we choose the boundary conditions correctly. The results of numerical calculations for the time dependent, nonlinear equations and for flow situations with time dependent inflow velocity profiles are presented. The convergence rateM
2 to incompressible solution is numerically confirmed. It is also shown that using Richardson extrapolation toM
2= 0 in order to derive a solution with very small divergence can with good result be carried through withM
2 as large as 0.1 and 0.05. As the time step in numerical methods must be chosen approximately such thatΔt · (i/(M Δx)−v/Δx
2) is in the stability region of the time stepping method, and asM
2=0.05 is sufficiently small to yield good results, the restriction on the time step due to the Mach number is not serious.

It is shown that the computation speed of the EFG method is higher than of the FP-method. It is determined that a serious disadvantage of the FP-method is its low rate convergence, while the computational complexity of each iteration is reasonable.

Based on the hypothesis of a smooth stress transition along the loaded and unloaded part of the rim, two new distributions (spline and new cosine) are proposed and analysed. Even if closed-form solutions were not feasible, the latter may be accurately solved numerically since the error committed is that of the numerical technique used.

Special attention is paid to the centre of the sample, of which stress state depends on the distribution shape and the contact angle. Finally, it is concluded that there is always a deviation from the values predicted due to the concentrated load as a consequence of the deformation induced by the jaw, which is especially significant in the uniform stress distribution and also influences the determination of the tensile strength in the material.","Diego José Guerrero-Miguel1, Martina Inmaculada Álvarez-Fernández1, Carmen Covadonga García-Fernández1, Celestino González-Nicieza1 & …Cesar Menéndez-Fernández",Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-019-10001-1,"Brazilian disk,Linear elasticity,Radial load,Stress field"

Two types of spherical surface domains are considered: (1) the interior of a spherical triangle, and (2) the exterior of a great circle arc extending for less thanπ radians (a spherical surface with a slit). In both cases, zero boundary conditions are imposed. In order to solve the resulting second-order elliptic partial differential equations in two independent variables, a finite difference approximation is employed. The fundamental eigenvalue is approximated by iteration utilizing the power method and point successive overrelaxation.

The results are correlated with the inherent numerical diffusion of these schemes. The study is also motivated by the necessity to examine whether reduced artificial viscosity can be used with the DRLLF scheme in computing viscous flows than was suggested in the original paper on inviscid computation. It is demonstrated that reduced artificial viscosity is not only possible, but it results in a scheme that is very efficient in the computation of the standard supersonic viscous flow over a flat plate, in that it is comparable in accuracy to the AUSM scheme in the boundary layer and better than it in shock resolution.

1883,Numerical Study of Propagation of Nonlinear Coupled Surface and Leaky Electromagnetic Waves in a Circular Cylindrical Metal–Dielectric Waveguide,"AbstractThe problem of propagation of coupled surface (TE) and leaky (TM) polarized electromagnetic waves in a Goubau line (a perfectly conducting cylinder covered with a concentric dielectric layer) filled with an inhomogeneous nonlinear medium is considered. A nonlinear coupled TE–TM wave is characterized by two (independent) frequencies \({{\omega }_{E}}\) and \({{\omega }_{M}}\) and two propagation constants \({{\hat {\gamma }}_{E}}\) and \({{\hat {\gamma }}_{M}}\). The physical problem is reduced to a nonlinear two-parameter eigenvalue field-matching problem for a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Two types of solutions are found: nonlinear solutions of the first type correspond to solutions of the linear problems (such solutions become linear when the nonlinearity coefficient tends to zero); solutions of the second type are purely nonlinear, since they do not transform into linear solutions when the nonlinearity coefficient decreases. The results of calculations of coupled propagation constants and coupled eigenmodes are presented.","Yu. G. Smirnov1,2, E. Yu. Smol’kin1,2 & M. O.

For comparison with experiments of Nakabayashi et al. and Wimmer, a narrow gap and a medium gap with clearance ratio β=0.06 and 0.18 respectively are considered for the Reynolds number range covering the first Hopf bifurcation point. With adequate initial conditions and temporary imposition of small wave-type perturbation, multiple periodic flow states with three different pair numbers of spiral Taylor-Görtler (TG) vortices have been simulated successfully for β=0.06, of which the 1-pair and 2-pair of spiral TG vortices are newly obtained.

1887,Kinematic and mixing characteristics of vortex interaction induced by a vortex generator model: a numerical study,"The underlying effect of vortex interaction characterized by the merging and non-merging on mixing enhancement is of fundamental significance to understand the flow dynamics of strut injectors in scramjets. Starting from a simplified configuration of a vortex generator, this study focuses on the influence of geometric parameters on vortex structures and fluid mixing through compressible Navier-Stokes (NS) simulations. By adjusting the induction of outer vortices, the inner co-rotating vortex pair exhibits two modes of interaction (merging/separation regime) reflected by closer/farther vortex centers. Defined by the zero variation rate of the inner vortex spacing, the critical state of equilibrium is determined. The critical condition is well predicted by a theoretical model based on the Biot-Savart law. Through the introduction of mixedness and mixing time, the intrinsic impact of interaction modes on fluid mixing is revealed. Compared with the vortex dynamics in the merging regime, the one in the separation regime is more effective for passive scalar mixing augmentation. With efficient material stretching characterized by the higher interface stretching factor and averaging finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE), the mixing time is shortened by as much as 2.5 times in the separation regime. The implication of the present two interaction regimes in mixing enhancement physically reflected by the averaging FTLE has the potential to improve the combustion performance and shorten the combustor chamber.","Ziang Wang1, Bin Yu1, Bin Zhang1, Miaosheng He1 & …Hong Liu",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-021-2711-5,"vortex interaction mode,fluid mixing,Lagrangian coherent structure (LCS),stretching effect"

An approximate version of the considered problem is constructed by the use of Taylor’s series expansion procedure first, and then, a new three term recurrence relationship is derived by applying the finite difference approximation techniques on it. Furthermore, an exponential fitting factor is introduced in the derived new scheme using the theory of singular perturbations and an efficient ’discrete invariant imbedding algorithm’ is used to solve the resulting tridiagonal system of equations. Convergence of the method is analyzed. Numerical experiments performed on several test examples; presentation of the computational results in terms of maximum absolute errors and the comparison of the results with some other method results, show the applicability and efficiency of the proposed scheme. Graphs plotted for the solution with varying shifts show the effect of small shifts on the boundary layer behavior of the solution.

The solution of the problem, being contaminated by a small perturbation parameter, exhibits layer behavior. There exist narrow regions, in the neighborhood of outflow boundary, where the solution has steep gradient. The presence of parasitic parameters, perturbation parameter and time delay, is often the source for the increased order and stiffness of these systems. The stiffness, attributed to the simultaneous occurrence of slow and fast phenomena and on their dependence on the past history of the physical systems. A numerical method based on standard finite difference operator is presented. The first step involves a discretization of time variable using backward Euler method. This results into a set of stationary singularly perturbed semi-discrete problems which are further discretized in space using standard finite difference operators. A priori explicit bounds on the solution of problem are established.

1904,Prospects of Tensor-Based Numerical Modeling of the Collective Electrostatics in Many-Particle Systems,"AbstractRecently the rank-structured tensor approach suggested a progress in the numerical treatment of the long-range electrostatics in many-particle systems and the respective interaction energy and forces. In this paper, we outline the prospects for tensor-based numerical modeling of the collective electrostatic potential on lattices and in many-particle systems of general type. Our approach, initially introduced for the rank-structured grid-based calculation of the interaction potentials on 3D lattices is generalized here to the case of many-particle systems with variable charges placed on \({{L}^{{ \otimes d}}}\) lattices and discretized on fine \({{n}^{{ \otimes d}}}\) Cartesian grids for arbitrary dimension \(d\). As a result, the interaction potential is represented in a parametric low-rank canonical format in \(O(dLn)\) complexity. The total interaction energy can be then calculated in \(O(dL)\) operations. Electrostatics in large bio-molecular systems is discretized on a fine \({{n}^{{ \otimes 3}}}\) grid by using the novel range-separated (RS) tensor format, which maintains the long-range part of the 3D collective potential of a many-body system in a parametric low-rank form in \(O(n)\)-complexity. We show how the energy and force field can be easily recovered by using the already precomputed electric field in the low-rank RS format. The RS tensor representation of the discretized Dirac delta enables the construction of the efficient energy preserving (conservative) regularization scheme for solving the 3D elliptic partial differential equations with strongly singular right-hand side arising in scientific computing. We conclude that the rank-structured tensor-based approximation techniques provide the promising numerical tools for applications to many-body dynamics in bio-sciences, protein docking and classification problems, for low-parametric interpolation of scattered data in data science, as well as in machine learning in many dimensions.","V.

1912,Finite difference numerical solution of Troesch’s problem on a piecewise uniform Shishkin mesh,"Finding numerical solutions to the Troesch’s problem is known to be challenging, especially when the sensitivity parameter \(\lambda \) is large. In this manuscript, we propose a numerical method for solving the Troesch’s problem which combines efficiency and accuracy, even for large sensitivity parameter. Our method can be summarized as a finite difference method formulated on a Shishkin mesh, which is piecewise uniform with smaller step size in the boundary layer in the neighborhood of the point \(x=1\). In fact, we treat the Troesch’s problem as a singularly perturbed problem with a special transition point on the mesh. The transition point for the Shishkin mesh is first defined and computed. The application of the finite difference method on the piecewise uniform mesh leads to a nonlinear matrix system, which is solved numerically using the generalized Newton’s method. While, existing numerical solvers suffer significantly when sensitivity parameter \(\lambda \) becomes large and fail to provide accurate numerical solutions for \(\lambda >20\) (Chang, Appl Math Comput 216(11):3303–3306, 2010; Khuri and Sayfy, Math Comput Model 54(9):1907–1918, 2011; Raja, Inf Sci 279:860–873, 2014; Temimi, Appl Math Comput 219(2):521–529, 2012), our method provides accurate numerical solution for large values of this sensitivity parameter, up to \(\lambda =100\). Moreover, the implementation of the method is straight forward and the computation cost is low. Numerical experiments show that the method provides accurate solutions for different values of the sensitivity parameter \(\lambda \).","Helmi Temimi1, Mohamed Ben-Romdhane1, Ali R.

1913,A numerical method for solving variable-order solute transport models,"In this work, a radial basis function (RBF)-based numerical scheme is developed which uses the Coimbra variable time fractional derivative of order \(0<\alpha (t,x)< 1\). The Coimbra derivative can efficiently model a dynamical system whose fractional-order behavior changes with time and space locations. The RBF can effectively approximate spatial derivatives in multi-dimensions. The resulted numerical scheme is RBF–FD type and is validated for solute transport problems in 1D and 2D dimension domains. Various cases of variable-order \(0<\alpha (t,x)< 1\) have been discussed. The present numerical scheme can effectively approximate those variable-order models whose exact solution can not be obtained in a simple way.","Marjan Uddin

1916,A comparison of four recent numerical schemes giving high resolution of shock wave and concentrated vortex,"In recent ten years high resolution difference schemes for the computation of the full unsteady Eulerian system of equations for invisid compressible gas finds celebrated progress. This paper tests furtherly, by a complex two-dimensional unsteady problem, four recent schemes, to them attentions are paid. The test problem is the initial stage of a two-dimensional diffraction and reflection of a plane shock wave, impinging on a rectangular obstacle. At whose top side there are two sharp corners, near which flow parameters finds severe variation. There is occurrence of expansion fan with a center and also concentrated vortices. To simulate them well, the schemes should have good adaptivity. The special shock Mach number M1=2.068 is so chosen, that at this M1 the partical velocity behind impinging shock in fixed coordinate system is just equal to the speed of sound there, this condition also occurs along a curve in the region of expansion fan with a center at the corner. This can clarify the computational feature of different schemes in case, when one of the eigenvalues is just zero. Zero eigenvalue may spoil some schemes locally. Graphical visualization of the computational results may show features of the tested schemes about the shock wave resolution, scheme viscosity, expansion wave and the ability to simulate the process of the generation of unsteady concentrated vortex.",Huang Dun1 & Yang Chun,Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,1994,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02451629,"high resolution schemes,shock wave reflection,diffraction,sharp corner,vortex generation"

These problems are quite challenging, and the transcendental nature of the delay makes them even more difficult. Hence, the development of efficient numerical methods is open for research. In this paper, we use the concepts of Laplace-like transform and variational theory to develop a new numerical method for solving TFNPDEs with proportional delay. The stability and convergence of the method are analyzed in the Banach sense. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by solving some test problems.

The governing non-linear dimensionless equations are solved by an implicit finite difference scheme of the Crank-Nicolson type with a tridiagonal matrix manipulation. The effects of various parameters entering into the problem on the unsteady dimensionless velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles are studied in detail. Furthermore, the time variation of the skin friction coefficient, the Nusselt number, and the Sherwood number is presented and analyzed. The results show that the unsteady velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles are substantially influenced by the Dufour and Soret effects. When the Dufour number increases or the Soret number decreases, both the skin friction and the Sherwood number decrease, while the Nusselt number increases. It is found that, when the magnetic parameter increases, the velocity and the temperature decrease in the boundary layer.","M. Q. Al-Odat1,2 & A.

Hydrodynamic model used includes liquid compressibility, heat conductivity of vapor and liquid, as well as evaporation and condensation on the interphase surface; the realistic wide-range equations of state are used. The calculation is performed on moving grids with explicit accentuation of the bubble surface. This technique is based on the TVD modification of the Godunov second order accuracy scheme in space and time. Its efficiency is due to an allowance for the special features of the problem in the final stage of focusing of nonspherical shock wave in the central part of the bubble. After the value of deformation of the shock exceeds the threshold (i.e., when the shock wave becomes largely nonspherical) in the central field of the bubble the curvilinear radially diverging grid is changed by the rectilinear oblique-angled grid close to Cartesian. At the same moment, the spherical immovable system of the reference frame is changed to a cylindrical system. The recalculation of the cell parameters from grid to grid is made by the method of conservative interpolation. The efficiency of the proposed approach is shown by the test problem’s calculation results and an illustrative example.","A. A. Aganin1, T. F. Khalitova1 & N. A.

1935,Numerical Simulation of the Filtration of a Steam–Water–Oil Mixture during the Thermal-Steam Treatment of a Reservoir,"AbstractA mathematical model and an algorithm for numerical modeling the filtration of a three-phase mixture of steam–water–oil in a porous reservoir under thermal steam treatment are presented. A two-dimensional formulation of the problem, as well as the convective and diffusion mechanisms of the heat and mass transfer of the mixture, are considered. The physical properties of the rock are assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic, and no explicit accounting for the rock’s fracturing is performed. The properties of steam and water are considered to be independent of the thermodynamic parameters of the system. The physical properties of oil are also independent of the thermodynamic parameters of the system, with the exception of dynamic viscosity, which is a function of temperature. To describe the change in the steam, water, and oil saturation, nonstationary balance ratios are used for each phase. From these ratios and the Darcy filtration law, the piezoconductivity equation is obtained for calculating the pressure distribution. The mixture’s temperature is calculated using the heat conduction equation within the hypothesis of a quasi-equilibrium thermal state of all the phases under consideration and a single temperature. The model also takes into account the phase transitions between steam and water. For this, the W.H. Lee model is used. Spatial discretization of the obtained equations is carried out by the finite volume method; and discretization in time, by using the direct Euler scheme. Since the used balance equations are nonlinear, Newton’s method is applied for their numerical solution. Using the constructed numerical scheme, we simulate the filtration of a three-phase steam–water–oil mixture through a porous reservations under conditions of steam-gravity drainage. In the course of the analysis of the simulation results, the features of the proposed numerical method are shown that arise when the phase transition between steam and water is taken into account.",S.

1947,Numerical approximation of young measuresin non-convex variational problems,"
Summary. In non-convex optimisation problems, in particular in non-convex variational problems, there usually does not exist any classical solution but only generalised solutions which involve Young measures. In this paper, first a suitable relaxation and approximation theory is developed together with optimality conditions, and then an adaptive scheme is proposed for the efficient numerical treatment. The Young measures solving the approximate problems are usually composed only from a few atoms. This is the main argument our effective active-set type algorithm is based on. The support of those atoms is estimated from the Weierstrass maximum principle which involves a Hamiltonian whose good guess is obtained by a multilevel technique. Numerical experiments are performed in a one-dimensional variational problem and support efficiency of the algorithm.",Carsten Carstensen1 & Tomáš Roubíček,Numerische Mathematik,2000,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002110050003,"Mathematics Subject Classification (1991):65K10, 65N50, 49M40"

We present efficient algorithms for applications of such designs to large-scale problems.

1949,Novel operational matrix method for the numerical solution of nonlinear reaction–advection–diffusion equation of fractional order,"In this work, a new scheme has been developed for the numerical solution of the fractional order reaction–advection–diffusion equation. To approximate the problem the authors have used Vieta–Fibonacci polynomials as basis functions and derived for the first time the operational matrices with the said polynomials for integer and fractional order Caputo differential operator. Using these operational matrices and collocating the residual together with initial and boundary conditions at certain collocation points, the problem is reduced to a system of algebraic equations. An approximate solution to the problem can be obtained by solving this system of equations. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are validated through error analysis between the obtained numerical results and the existing analytical results for the particular forms of the considered model.

The governing equations of nanofluid are simplified using similarity variables with the help of momentum, energy and concentration equations. The resulting highly nonlinear coupled differential equations are solved with the help of successive linearization method and Chebyshev spectral collocation method. The impact of all the pertinent parameters such as Hartmann number, suction/injection parameter, heat source/sink parameter, Lewis number, Prandtl number, Brownian motion parameter, thermophoresis parameter are demonstrated graphically. Furthermore, the effect of Brinkman number and Reynolds number are also presented for entropy generation. It is analyzed that the velocity of the fluid increases due to greater influence of magnetic field and porosity parameter. Moreover, it is also observed that the entropy generation number increase due to the increment in Brinkman number and Reynolds number. Numerical comparison is also given with the existing published literature and found that the present results are in good agreement.","M. M. Bhatti1 & M. M.

1951,Numerical Investigations of an Implicit Leapfrog Time-Domain Meshless Method,"Numerical solution of partial differential equations governing time domain simulations in computational electromagnetics, is usually based on grid methods in space and on explicit schemes in time. A predefined grid in the problem domain and a stability step size restriction need. Recently, the authors have reformulated the meshless framework based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics, in order to be applied for time domain electromagnetic simulation. Despite the good spatial properties, the numerical explicit time integration introduces, also in a meshless context, a severe constraint. In this paper, at first, the stability condition is addressed in a general way by allowing the time step increment get away from the minimum points spacing. Then, an alternating direction implicit leapfrog scheme for time evolution is proposed. The unconditional stability of the method is analytically provided and numerically validated. The stability of the method has been proved by avoiding the algebra developments related to the usually adopted von Neumann analysis. Three case studies are investigated by achieving a satisfactory agreement by comparing both numerical and analytical results.",Guido Ala1 & Elisa Francomano,Journal of Scientific Computing,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-014-9881-6,"ADI leapfrog method,Meshless methods, Smoothed particle electromagnetics"

A devil's staircase and period-doubling cascades are presented with forcing frequency and amplitude as control parameters. In both cases, details are provided in a bifurcation diagram.

1954,Positive Periodic Solution and Numerical Optimization in the Harvesting Effort for a Single-Species Stage-Structured System with Birth Pulses,"In this paper, we consider a single-species stage-structured model with birth pulses and the harvesting of the species. Especially, we assume that the species can be divided into the immature and the mature, which exhibit different death rates. The mature species reproduces at fixed moments each year because the birth of many species is seasonal or occurs in a regular pulse, and the species is harvested not during the whole year but during a single period of the year. For such a system, we obtain conditions which guarantee the existence of a stable positive periodic solution. This implies that sustainable exploitation of the species can be maintained if we use the proper strategy in the harvesting effort and timing. Further, in order to get the maximum annual sustainable yield, we optimize the harvesting using numerical analysis; in addition, we find that the harvesting timing affects the maximum annual sustainable yield. Lastly, we show the effects of birth rate and harvesting effort on the dynamical complexity of the system with the help of a bifurcation graph.",Ling Zhen Dong1 & Lan Sun Chen,Computational Mathematics and Modeling,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10598-005-0016-7,"Death Rate,Mathematical Modeling,Birth Rate,Computational Mathematic,Industrial Mathematic"

The time dependences of the phase variables have the second, fourth, or sixth order of accuracy. The order depends on the chosen values of the free parameters of the family.

To this end, the thermal conduction equation with the Stefan condition and the mass diffusion equation are solved to depict the temperature and solute concentration distributions, respectively. In dealing with the heat transfer problem with phase change, the temperature field is weakly enriched using the corrected abs-enrichment scheme to avoid the blending element problem. The melting temperature imposed by the penalty method at the solid–liquid interface is solute concentration dependent. On the other hand in dealing with the mass transport problem, due to the strong discontinuity in the concentration field at the interface, the sign-enrichment scheme is used. A constant separating out concentration is enforced on the solid side of the interface also by the penalty method, while a mass flux is naturally applied on the liquid side. The phase interface is captured implicitly by the level set method, which is applied on the same fixed finite element mesh. The robustness and the accuracy of the model are demonstrated through numerical case studies.","Min Li1,2,3, Hicham Chaouki1,2, Jean-Loup Robert1, Donald Ziegler4 & …Mario Fafard1,",Journal of Scientific Computing,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-018-0759-x,"Extended finite element method,Level set method,Stefan problem,Mass transport"

Nonlinear ODE models are widely used in applications. But their analytic solutions are usually not available. Thus regular methods usually depend on repetitive use of numerical solutions which bring huge computational cost. We proposed a new two-stage approach which includes a smoothing method (kernel smoothing or local polynomial fitting) in the first stage, and a numerical discretization method (Eulers discretization method, the trapezoidal discretization method, or the Runge-Kutta discretization method) in the second stage. Through numerical simulations, we find the proposed method gains a proper balance between estimation accuracy and computational cost. Asymptotic properties are also presented, which show the consistency and asymptotic normality of estimators under some mild conditions. The proposed method is compared to existing methods in term of accuracy and computational cost. The simulation results show that the estimators with local linear smoothing in the first stage and trapezoidal discretization in the second stage have the lowest average relative errors. We apply the proposed method to HIV dynamics data to illustrate the practicability of the estimator.","Tao Hu1, Yan Ping Qiu2, Heng Jian Cui1 & …Li Hong Chen","Acta Mathematica Sinica, English Series",2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10114-015-4256-y,"Nonparametric regression,kernel smoothing,local polynomial fitting,parametric identification,ordinary differential equation,numerical discretization,two-stage method"

1972,Numerical simulation on evolution of subharmonic low-speed streaks in minimal channel turbulent flow,"The evolution of low-speed streaks in the turbulent boundary layer of the minimum channel flow unit at a low Reynolds number is simulated by the direct numerical simulation (DNS) based on the standard Fourier-Chebyshev spectral method. The subharmonic sinuous (SS) mode for two spanwise-aligned low-speed streaks is excited by imposing the initial perturbations. The possibilities and the physical realities of the turbulent sustaining in the minimal channel unit are examined. Based on such a flow field environment, the evolution of the low-speed streaks during a cycle of turbulent sustaining, including lift-up, oscillation, and breakdown, is investigated. The development of streamwise vortices and the dynamics of vortex structures are examined. The results show that the vortices generated from the same streak are staggered along the streamwise direction, while the vortices induced by different streaks tilt toward the normal direction due to the mutual induction effect. It is the spatial variations of the streamwise vortices that cause the lift-up of the streaks. By resolving the transport dynamics of enstrophy, the strength of the vortices is found to continuously grow in the logarithmic layer through the vortex stretching mechanism during the evolution of streaks. The enhancement of the vortices contributes to the spanwise oscillation and the following breakdown of the low-speed streaks.","Jian Li

1974,A high order method for numerical solution of time-fractional KdV equation by radial basis functions,"A radial basis function method for solving time-fractional KdV equation is presented. The Caputo derivative is approximated by the high order formulas introduced in Buhman (Proc. Edinb. Math. Soc. 36:319–333, 1993). By choosing the centers of radial basis functions as collocation points, in each time step a nonlinear system of algebraic equations is obtained. A fixed point predictor–corrector method for solving the system is introduced. The efficiency and accuracy of our method are demonstrated through several illustrative examples. By the examples, the experimental convergence order is approximately \(4-\alpha \), where \(\alpha \) is the order of time derivative.

1978,The average a posteriori error of numerical methods,"The definition of the average error of numerical methods (by example of a quadrature formula\(\tilde S(f) = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {c_i f(a_i )}\) to approximateS(f)=∝ f d μ on a function classF) is difficult, because on many important setsF there is no natural probability measure in the sense of an equidistribution. We define the average a posteriori error of an approximation\(\tilde S\) by an averaging process over the set of possible information, which is used by\(\tilde S\) (in the example of a quadrature formula,N(F)={(f(a
1), ...,f/f∈F} is the set of posible information). This approach has the practical advantage that the averaging process is related only to finite dimensional sets and uses only the usual Lebesgue measure. As an application of the theory I consider the numerical integration of functions of the classF={f:[0,1]→ℝ/f(x)−f(y)|≦|x−y|}. For arbitrary (fixed) knotsa

i
 we determine the optimal coefficientsc

i
 for the approximation\(\tilde S(f) = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {c_i f(a_i )}\) and compute the resulting average error. The latter is minimal for the knots\(a_i = \frac{{3i - 2}}{{3n - 1}}(i = 1,...,n)\). (It is well known that the maximal error is minimal for the knotsa

i

\(a_i = \frac{{2i - 1}}{{2n}}(i = 1,...,n)\).) Then the adaptive methods for the same problem and methods for seeking the maximum of a Lipschitz function are considered.

1985,Dimp-Hydro Solver for Direct Numerical Simulation of Fluid Microflows within Pore Space of Core Samples,"AbstractThe paper is devoted to a description of the DiMP-Hydro software package being developed at the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics (Russian Academy of Sciences). It is intended to simulate microflows of single- and two-phase viscous compressible fluids with different rheology in spatial voxel domains. Such geometric models are relevant due to the development and widespread use of computer microtomography methods. One of the main areas of the application of this software package is the simulation of microflows within pore spaces of core (rock) samples. The simulation results can be used to determine the macroscopic properties of core samples (for instance, absolute permeability) and features of displacement processes at the micro level, which is one of main tasks of digital rock technology. The used mathematical models, numerical algorithms, and the software package are described. To describe the fluid dynamics, the regularized Navier–Stokes (for single-phase flows) and Navier–Stokes–Cahn–Hillard equations (for two-phase flows) are used. The regularization is based on the quasi-hydrodynamic approach, which is physically justified and makes it possible to use explicit stable numerical algorithms that are relatively simple to implement. The software package is parallel and focused on the use of high-performance computing systems. The results of the use of DiMP-Hydro to simulate microflows of fluid (including two-phase fluid) and gas (including moderately rarefied gas) in the pore space of core samples are presented.","V. A.

2002,Direct numerical simulation of compressible isotropic turbulence,"Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of decaying compressible isotropic turbulence at turbulence Mach numbers of Mt = 0.2-0.7 and Taylor Reynolds numbers of 72 and 153 is performed by using the 7th order upwind-biased difference and 8th order center difference schemes. Results show that proper upwind-biased difference schemes can release the limit of“start-up” problem to Mach numbers.Compressibility effects on the statistics of turbulent flow as well as the mechanics of shocklets in compressible turbulence are also studied, and the conclusion is drawn that high Mach number leads to more dissipation. Scaling laws in compressible turbulence are also analyzed. Evidence is obtained that scaling laws and extended self similarity (ESS) hold in the compressible turbulent flow in spite of the presence of shocklets, and compressibility has little effect on scaling exponents.","Li Xinliang1, Fu Dexun1 & Ma Yanwen",Science in China Series A: Mathematics,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02880040,"direct numerical simulation,isotropic turbulence,compressibility effect,scaling law"

In this paper, we adopt C-Bézier and H-Bézier basis functions to construct test and trial function spaces of finite element method to get numerical solution of convection-diffusion equations. Compared with Lagrange basis functions, numerical accuracy is improved by \(1-3\) order-of magnitudes which implies a much better approximation in simulating convection-diffusion problems.

2008,An approach based on fractional-order Lagrange polynomials for the numerical approximation of fractional order non-linear Volterra-Fredholm integro-differential equations,"This article discussed and analyzed a numerical technique based on fractional-order Lagrange polynomials to solve a class of fractional-order non-linear Volterra-Fredholm integro-differential equations. The fractional derivative has been considered of Caputo type. The existence and uniqueness of the continuous solution have been discussed for the given problem. In this approach, first using the Laplace transform, fractional-order Lagrange polynomials operational matrices of fractional integration have been derived. Then using these operational matrices, the continuous problem has been reduced into a system of algebraic equations. The error analysis also has been carried out and an upper error bound estimate for the approximate solution has been given in \(L^2\)-norm. It is also shown that as the number of fractional-order Lagrange polynomials increases, the approximation error approaches to zero rapidly. Further, some numerical examples are discussed to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed numerical technique and to validate our theoretical findings.

In this approach the fractional differential equation is converted into system of equations. The non-integer derivative ""\(\alpha \)"" is considered in Caputo sense. The discretization of Caputo derivative is done using L1 formula, while B-spline basis functions are used for the interpolation of spatial derivative.

2016,Numerical approximations and regularizations of Riccati equations arising in hyperbolic dynamics with unbounded control operators,"This paper provides an approximation theory for numerical computations of the solutions to algebraic Riccati equations arising in hyperbolic, boundary control problems. One of the difficulties in the approximation theory for Riccati equations is that many attractive numerical methods (such as standard finite elements) do not satisfy a “uniform stabilizability” condition, which is necessary for the stability of the approximate Riccati solutions. To deal with these problems, a regularizationapproximation technique, based on the introduction of special “artificial” terms to the dynamics of the original model, is proposed. The need for this regularization appears to be a distinct feature of hyperbolic (hyperbolic-like) equations, rather than parabolic (parabolic-like) problems where the smoothing effect of the dynamics is beneficial for the convergence and stability properties of approximate solutions to the associated Riccati equations (see [14]). The ultimate result demonstrates that the regularized, finite-dimensional feedback control yields near optimal performance and that the corresponding Riccati solution satisfies all the desired convergence properties. The general theory is illustrated by an example of a boundary control problem associated with the Kirchoff plate model. Some numerical results are provided for the given example.",Erik Hendrickson1 & Irena Lasiecka,Computational Optimization and Applications,1993,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01299546,"Approximation,regularization,stabilization,Riccati equation,Kirchoff plate"

2027,Formulation of Kinetic Energy Preserving Conservative Schemes for Gas Dynamics and Direct Numerical Simulation of One-Dimensional Viscous Compressible Flow in a Shock Tube Using Entropy and Kinetic Energy Preserving Schemes,"
This paper follows up on the author’s recent paper “The Construction of Discretely Conservative Finite Volume Schemes that also Globally Conserve Energy or Enthalpy”. In the case of the gas dynamics equations the previous formulation leads to an entropy preserving (EP) scheme. It is shown in the present paper that it is also possible to construct the flux of a conservative finite volume scheme to produce a kinetic energy preserving (KEP) scheme which exactly satisfies the global conservation law for kinetic energy. A proof is presented for three dimensional discretization on arbitrary grids. Both the EP and KEP schemes have been applied to the direct numerical simulation of one-dimensional viscous flow in a shock tube. The computations verify that both schemes can be used to simulate flows with shock waves and contact discontinuities without the introduction of any artificial diffusion. The KEP scheme performed better in the tests.

This paper applies this framework to the wave equation system and the system of shallow water equations. For the wave equation a curl-preservation for the momentum variable is present and easily identified. The preservation in case of the shallow water system is more involved due to the presence of convection. It leads to the vorticity evolution as generalized curl-constraint. The mechanisms of vorticity generation are discussed.For the numerical discretization special curl-preserving flux distributions are discussed and their incorporation into a finite volume scheme described. This leads to numerical discretizations which are exactly curl-preserving for a specific class of discrete curl-operators.The numerical experiments for the wave equation show a significant improvement of the new method against classical schemes. The extension of the curl-free numerical discretization to the shallow water case is possible after isolating the pressure flux. Simulation examples demonstrate the influence of the modification. The vortex structure is more clearly resolved.

2033,Analytical and numerical temperature distribution in a 3-D triple-layer skin tissue subjected to a multi-point laser beam,"In the present study, the temporal and spatial variation of temperature in a three-dimensional triple-layer skin tissue under the laser heating is determined. Using the method of separation of variables along with the Laplace transform, the so-called Pennes bio-heat equation is analytically solved in a 3D triple-layer tissue in which each layer has its own thermo-physical properties. The laser heating of the skin, with both single and multiple laser beams, is modelled based on time-dependent Gaussian-shaped irradiance distributions with exponential axial attenuation. For the presented solution approach, it can be shown that the laser can be considered as an arbitrary function of time such as pulses with a specified time interval with each desired spatial distribution. Besides the analytical solution, the governing equations are solved numerically by using the standard finite element method and the results are compared with the analytical solution to investigate the effects of laser heating on human skin. The effects of using single and multiple-point laser beams on the temperature increment are investigated. A good agreement between both analytical and numerical solutions is observed. The obtained results indicate that a better temperature distribution in the skin tissue is obtained; whenever, a multi-point laser is employed.","Babak Partovi1, Hossein Ahmadikia1 & Mehdi Mosharaf-Dehkordi

2037,"Iterative Algorithms for Multiscale State Estimation, Part 2: Numerical Investigations","Usually, direct methods are employed for the solution of linear systems arising in the context of optimization. However, motivated by the potential of multiscale refinement schemes for large problems of dynamic state estimation, we investigate in this paper the application of iterative solvers based on the concepts developed in Ref. 1. Specifically, we explore the effect of different system reductions for various Krylov-space iteration methods as well as three concepts of preconditioning. The first one is the normalization of states and outputs, which also favors error analysis. Next, diagonal scale-dependent preconditioners are compared; they all bound the condition numbers independently of the refinement scale, but exhibit significant quantitative differences. Finally, the effect of the regularization parameter on condition numbers and iteration numbers is analyzed. It turns out that a so-called simplified Uzawa scheme with Jacobi preconditioning and suitable regularization parameter is most efficient. The experiments also reveal that further improvements are necessary.","T. Binder1, L. Blank2, W. Dahmen3 & …W.

2040," Determination of reflector surfaces from near-field scattering data II. Numerical solution
"," Let \(O\) be a nonisotropic point source of light, and \(I(m)\) the power intensity of this source in direction \(m\). Suppose that the light rays emitted by the source \(O\) through an aperture \(D\) fall on a perfectly reflecting surface \(R\) and reflect off it so that the reflected rays illuminate a closed domain \(T\) on some plane with intensity \(L\). The inverse problem consists of constructing the reflector surface \(R\) from given position of the source \(O\), the input aperture \(D\), function \(I\), “target” set \(T\), and output intensity \(L\). For example, the input intensity may have a “bell”-like shape and we may wish to redistribute the energy uniformly over a prespecified region. The analytical formulation of the described above problem leads to a non-linear partial differential equation of Monge-Ampère type. In our previous paper we proved existence of weak solutions to this inverse problem and in this paper we describe and illustrate with examples an algorithm for its numerical solution.

2042,Fast hybrid numerical-asymptotic boundary element methods for high frequency screen and aperture problems based on least-squares collocation,"We present a hybrid numerical-asymptotic (HNA) boundary element method (BEM) for high frequency scattering by two-dimensional screens and apertures, whose computational cost to achieve any prescribed accuracy remains bounded with increasing frequency. Our method is a collocation implementation of the high order hp HNA approximation space of Hewett et al. (IMA J Numer Anal 35:1698–1728, 2015), where a Galerkin implementation was studied. An advantage of the current collocation scheme is that the one-dimensional highly oscillatory singular integrals appearing in the BEM matrix entries are significantly easier to evaluate than the two-dimensional integrals appearing in the Galerkin case, which leads to much faster computation times. Here we compute the required integrals at frequency-independent cost using the numerical method of steepest descent, which involves complex contour deformation. The change from Galerkin to collocation is nontrivial because naive collocation implementations based on square linear systems suffer from severe numerical instabilities associated with the numerical redundancy of the HNA basis, which produces highly ill-conditioned BEM matrices. In this paper we show how these instabilities can be removed by oversampling, and solving the resulting overdetermined collocation system in a weighted least-squares sense using a truncated singular value decomposition. On the basis of our numerical experiments, the amount of oversampling required to stabilise the method is modest (around 25% typically suffices), and independent of frequency. As an application of our method we present numerical results for high frequency scattering by prefractal approximations to the middle-third Cantor set.","A. Gibbs

So, the prime focus of this analyzation is to describe the model of heat and mass transfer phenomenons of two-phase magnetohydrodynamic dusty nanofluids over a vertical sinusoidal wavy surface. The significances of Brownian motion and thermophoresis effects have been considered in the model. The three various nanofluids namely Aluminium oxide (\(\hbox {Al}_2\hbox {O}_3\))-water, Copper (Cu)-water and Titanium oxide (\(\hbox {TiO}_2\))-water immersed with conducting dust particles are taken into consideration for flow analysis. Novel governing equations involving conservation of momentum, mass and thermal energy are subjected to irregular region and converted into non-dimensional form. The resultant equations are numerically approached by developing a finite difference technique with Newton’s quasilinearization method using mathematical software MATLAB. Dynamic characteristics of the flow with the effect of physical parameters associated with velocity, temperature and concentration distributions are interpreted through graphs to get some physical view into the flow patterns. Also, skin-friction coefficient, heat and mass transfer rate are calculated at the boundaries and the outcomes obtained are compared with existing literature.","G. Kalpana1, K. R. Madhura2,3,4, S. S.

A variety of benchmark cases of Euler equations are tested to further verify the new scheme’s performance.

This is a three-parameter system of pde’s that models the propagation of internal waves along the interface of two-fluid layers with rigid lid condition for the upper layer, and under a Boussinesq regime for the upper layer and a full dispersion regime for the lower layer. We first discretize in space the periodic initial-value problem with a Fourier–Galerkin spectral method and prove error estimates for several ranges of values of the parameters. Solitary-wave solutions of the model are then studied numerically in several ways. The numerical generation is analyzed by approximating the ode system with periodic boundary conditions for the solitary-wave profiles with a Fourier spectral scheme, implemented in a collocation form, and solving iteratively the corresponding algebraic system in Fourier space with the Petviashvili method accelerated with the minimal polynomial extrapolation technique. Motivated by the numerical experiments, a new result of existence of solitary waves is proved.

2060,Numerical investigation of effect of rolling manipulation of traditional Chinese medical massage on blood flow,"The hemodynamic mechanism of rolling manipulation (RM) of traditional Chinese medical massage (TCMM) is investigated. An axisymmetrical nonlinear model and an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element method (ALE-FEM) with rezoning algorithm were introduced to study the viscous flow through an axisymmetrical rigid tube with axially moving stenosis to simulate the rolling manipulation. Flow rate and wall shear stress were obtained by solving complete Navier-Stokes equations numerically. The numerical results show that the stenosis moving frequency, namely the frequency of rolling manipulation, has great effect on the disturbance of flow and the wall shear stress. The stenosis coefficient, which characterizes the severity of the stenosis, another adjustable parameter in rolling manipulation, also shows the significant effect on flow rate and wall shear stress. These numerical results may provide some data that can be taken into consideration when massage is used in clinic.","Xu Shi-xiong1, Ji Lin2 & Wang Qing-wei",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02465426,"traditional Chinese medical massage (TCMM),rolling manipulation (RM),moving stenosed vessel,blood flow,Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element method"
2061,A simplex-based numerical framework for simple and efficient robust design optimization,"The Simplex Stochastic Collocation (SSC) method is an efficient algorithm for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in computational problems with random inputs. In this work, we show how its formulation based on simplex tessellation, high degree polynomial interpolation and adaptive refinements can be employed in problems involving optimization under uncertainty. The optimization approach used is the Nelder-Mead algorithm (NM), also known as Downhill Simplex Method. The resulting SSC/NM method, called Simplex2, is based on (i) a coupled stopping criterion and (ii) the use of an high-degree polynomial interpolation in the optimization space for accelerating some NM operators. Numerical results show that this method is very efficient for mono-objective optimization and minimizes the global number of deterministic evaluations to determine a robust design. This method is applied to some analytical test cases and a realistic problem of robust optimization of a multi-component airfoil.","Pietro Marco Congedo1, Jeroen Witteveen2 & Gianluca Iaccarino",Computational Optimization and Applications,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10589-013-9569-0,"Nelder-Mead method,Simplex stochastic collocation method,Robust optimization,Uncertainty quantification"
2062,Error estimates for the numerical approximation of Neumann control problems,"
We continue the discussion of error estimates for the numerical analysis of Neumann boundary control problems we started in Casas et al. (Comput. Optim. Appl. 31:193–219, 2005). In that paper piecewise constant functions were used to approximate the control and a convergence of order O(h) was obtained. Here, we use continuous piecewise linear functions to discretize the control and obtain the rates of convergence in L
2(Γ). Error estimates in the uniform norm are also obtained. We also discuss the approach suggested by Hinze (Comput. Optim. Appl. 30:45–61, 2005) as well as the improvement of the error estimates by making an extra assumption over the set of points corresponding to the active control constraints. Finally, numerical evidence of our estimates is provided.

Forward-backward approximation is used for the Robin boundary conditions and a central finite difference approximation is proposed for the differential system in conjunction with piecewise uniform Shishkin meshes and graded Bakhvalov meshes.

2066,A language for nonlinear programming problems,"An algebraic-like language for nonlinear programming problems is described. The rationale for the computation of the function values, gradients, and sēcond partial derivatives of the functions from their algebraic representation is developed. Each function is translated into an explicit “factorable” form or hierarchical representation which is used interpretively to compute the function value, gradient, and second partials of the function at each point for which such values are required. Computational efficiency is achieved by computing the matrix of second partials as the sum of a set of vector outer products, the vectors having resulted from the gradient computation, plus a diagonal matrix. An experimental computer program which implements the language and ties it to SUMT is described. In the experience with this program the computer times required have ranged from 4 to 30 times those times required by computer solutions to the same problems by using analyst-prepared programs to compute the function values, gradients, and second partial derivatives. A program based on a compiler approach to implementing the language, rather than the interpretative approach of the experimental program, will probably result in computer times between one and two times those required by using analyst-prepared programs.",Robert E.

The generation of layer resolving grids, which is based on estimates of solution derivatives and formulations of coordinate transformations eliminating the solution singularities, is a generalization of a method for a first-order scheme developed earlier. This paper presents formulas of the coordinate transformations and numerical experiments for first-, second-, and third-order schemes on uniform and layer resolving grids for equations with boundary, interior, exponential, and power layers of various scales. Numerical experiments confirm the uniform convergence of the numerical solutions performed with the compact high-order schemes on the layer resolving grids. By using transfinite interpolation or numerical solutions to the Beltrami and diffusion equations in a control metric based on coordinate transformations eliminating the solution singularities, this technology can be generalized to the solution of multi-dimensional equations with boundary and interior layers.","V.

For solution, numerical approximations were adopted, based on the finite element method for the spatial discretization and Crank–Nicolson for the time variable. The parameters of the equation were modeled taking into account aspects of multiple varieties of natural phenomena, based on fuzzy sets. The two-dimensional model resulted in the value of pollutant dispersion taking into account the flow velocity, in situations of prevailing winds in the region of a reservoir of Sao Paulo. According to the results, it was observed that the integration of the numerical methods and the fuzzy parameters is a potential instrument for environmental process analysis. The rule-based systems allowed a better design of the local natural phenomena.

2071,Analytical and numerical method of finite bodies for calculation of cylindrical orthotropic shell with rectangular hole,To solve the boundary-value problem for cylindrical orthotropic shell with sizeable rectangular hole we suggest analytical and numerical method of finite bodies. For determination of the stress state of orthotropic thin-walled cylinder we use a systemof equations that exactly satisfies the equilibrium equations of orthotropic cylindrical shell. Representation of the solutions is divided into basic and self-equilibrium state. For some loads of a shell we build the basic stress state. We obtain a countable number of resolving functions that exactly satisfy the equations of a shell and describe the self-equilibrium stress state. We develop the algorithm of the analytical and numerical solutions of boundary-value problem based on approximation of the stress state of a shell by finite sum of resolving functions and propose a universal way of reduction of all conditions of the contact parts of the enclosure and the boundary conditions to minimize the generalized quadratic forms. We establish criteria under which the construction of approximate solutions coincides with the exact one.,V. N. Bakulin1 & V. P.

2073,A Model of Transport and Transformation of Biogenic Elements in the Coastal System and Its Numerical Implementation,"AbstractA discrete mathematical model of hydrobiology of coastal zone is constructed and analyzed. The model takes into account the transport and transformation of polluting biogenic elements in water basins. The propagation and transformation of biogenic elements is affected by such physical factors as three-dimensional motion of water taking into account the advective transport and microturbulent diffusion, spatially inhomogeneous distribution of temperature, salinity, and oxygen. Biogenic pollutants typically arrive into the water basin with river flow, which depends on the weather and climate of the geographic region, or with drainage of insufficiently purified domestic and industrial waste or other kinds of anthropogenic impact. Biogenic pollutants can also appear due to secondary pollution processes, such as stirring up and transport of bed silt, shore abrasion, etc. Stoichiometric relations between biogenic nutrients for phytoplankton algae that can be used to determine the limiting nutrient for each species are obtained. Observation models describing the consumption, accumulation of nutrients, and growth of phytoplankton are considered. A three-dimensional mathematical model of transformation of forms of phosphorus, nitrogen, and silicon in the plankton dynamics problem in coastal systems is constructed and analyzed. This model takes into account the convective and diffusive transport, absorption, and release of nutrients by phytoplankton as well as transformation cycles of phosphorus, nitrogen, and silicon forms. Numerical methods for solving the problem that are based on high-order weighted finite difference schemes and take into account the degree of fill of the computation domain control cells are developed. These methods are implemented on a multiprocessing system. They make it possible to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution and decrease the computation time by several fold. Based on the numerical implementation, dangerous phenomena in coastal systems related to the propagation of pollutants, including oil spill, eutrophication, and algae bloom, which causes suffocation phenomena in water basins, are reconstructed.","V.

2074,A class of quasi-variable mesh methods based on off-step discretization for the numerical solution of fourth-order quasi-linear parabolic partial differential equations,"Numerical schemes based on off-step discretization are developed to solve two classes of fourth-order time-dependent partial differential equations subjected to appropriate initial and boundary conditions. The difference methods reported here are second-order accurate in time and second-order accurate in space and, for a nonuniform grid, second-order accurate in time and third-order accurate in space. In case of a uniform grid, the second scheme is of order two in time and four in space. The presented methods split the original problem to a coupled system of two second-order equations and involve only three spatial grid points of a compact stencil without discretizing the boundary conditions. The linear stability of the presented methods has been examined, and it is shown that the proposed two-level finite difference method is unconditionally stable for a linear model problem. The new developed methods are directly applicable to fourth-order parabolic partial differential equations with singular coefficients, which is the main highlight of our work. The methods are successfully tested on singular problems. The proposed method is applied to find numerical solutions of the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation and complex fourth-order nonlinear equations like the good Boussinesq equation.

2076,Numerical Comparison of Augmented Lagrangian Algorithms for Nonconvex Problems,"Augmented Lagrangian algorithms are very popular tools for solving nonlinear programming problems. At each outer iteration of these methods a simpler optimization problem is solved, for which efficient algorithms can be used, especially when the problems are large. The most famous Augmented Lagrangian algorithm for minimization with inequality constraints is known as Powell-Hestenes-Rockafellar (PHR) method. The main drawback of PHR is that the objective function of the subproblems is not twice continuously differentiable. This is the main motivation for the introduction of many alternative Augmented Lagrangian methods. Most of them have interesting interpretations as proximal point methods for solving the dual problem, when the original nonlinear programming problem is convex. In this paper a numerical comparison between many of these methods is performed using all the suitable problems of the CUTE collection.","E. G. Birgin1, R. A. Castillo2 & J. M.

2084,Cracking bones and numbers: solving the enigma of numerical sequences on ancient Chinese artifacts,"Numerous recent discoveries in China of ancient tombs have greatly increased our knowledge of ritual and religious practices. These discoveries include excavated oracle bones, bronze, jade, stone and pottery objects, and bamboo manuscripts dating from the twelfth to fourth century BCE. Inscribed upon these artifacts are a large number of records of numerical sequences, for which no explanation has been found of how they were produced. Structural links to the Book of Changes, a divination manual that entered the Confucian canon, are evident; yet, the algorithm described therein dates to the slightly later second to first century BCE. By combining archeological and statistical evidence, we propose a new methodology that enables us to reconstruct and test cleromantic techniques which can explain how these numerical sequences were generated. Dice and divination stalk use, either in combination or separately, appear in fact to have been underlying the rather stable numerical patterns in ancient China all the way back to the late Shang dynasty (1300–1046 BCE). Bringing to light such a long-standing technique, which awaits further confirmation from the ever-growing database of newly discovered numerical and textual records, can change drastically our understanding of early Chinese history and of the historical development of sophisticated arithmetical practices and the rationalization of chance.","Andrea Bréard

So far, these reformulations have either been studied independently or as a joint optimization problem in an attempt to take advantage of the best properties from each model. To the best of our knowledge, these reformulations have not yet been compared in the existing literature. This paper is a first attempt towards establishing whether one of these reformulations is best at solving a given class of the optimistic bilevel optimization problem. We design a comparison framework, which seems fair, considering the theoretical properties of these reformulations.

2089,Fast and High-Order Accuracy Numerical Methods for Time-Dependent Nonlocal Problems in \({\pmb {\mathbb {R}}}^2\),"In this paper, we study the Crank–Nicolson method for temporal dimension and the piecewise quadratic polynomial collocation method for spatial dimensions of time-dependent nonlocal problems. The new theoretical results of such discretization are that the proposed numerical method is unconditionally stable and its global truncation error is of \({\mathscr {O}}\left( \tau ^2+h^{4-\gamma }\right) \) with \(0<\gamma <1\), where \(\tau \) and h are the discretization sizes in the temporal and spatial dimensions respectively. Also we develop the conjugate gradient squared method to solving the resulting discretized nonsymmetric and indefinite systems arising from time-dependent nonlocal problems including two-dimensional cases. By using additive and multiplicative Cauchy kernels in nonlocal problems, structured coefficient matrix-vector multiplication can be performed efficiently in the conjugate gradient squared iteration. Numerical examples are given to illustrate our theoretical results and demonstrate that the computational cost of the proposed method is of \(O(M \log M)\) operations where M is the number of collocation points.","Rongjun Cao1, Minghua Chen

By establishing the weak-continuity of the parameter-to-solution map, we are able to ensure the existence of minimizers and thus the well-posedness of the regularization method.

2096,On the numerical solution of Fisher’s equation with coefficient of diffusion term much smaller than coefficient of reaction term,"Li et al. (SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 20:719–738, 1998) used the moving mesh partial differential equation (MMPDE) to solve a scaled Fisher’s equation and the initial condition consisting of an exponential function. The results obtained are not accurate because MMPDE is based on a familiar arc-length or curvature monitor function. Qiu and Sloan (J. Comput. Phys. 146:726–746, 1998) constructed a suitable monitor function called modified monitor function and used it with the moving mesh differential algebraic equation (MMDAE) method to solve the same problem of scaled Fisher’s equation and obtained better results.In this work, we use the forward in time central space (FTCS) scheme and the nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme, and we find that the temporal step size must be very small to obtain accurate results. This causes the computational time to be long if the domain is large. We use two techniques to modify these two schemes either by introducing artificial viscosity or using the approach of Ruxun et al. (Int. J. Numer. Methods Fluids 31:523–533, 1999). These techniques are efficient and give accurate results with a larger temporal step size. We prove that these four methods are consistent for partial differential equations, and we also obtain the region of stability.","K. M. Agbavon1, A. R. Appadu1 & M.

The techniques with these characteristics are rarely found in the literature. Comparing in the context of computational efficiency, both of the developed methods are exceptional, and outperform the existing methods.

The problem is singular for the invisible modes, and therefore the commonly used Lagrange multiplier method cannot predict an optimum solution but just a saddle point. To eliminate the singularity, an additional amplitude inequality constraint is added to the problem. A numerical optimization code with a sequential quadratic programming method is used to solve the problem. The method is applied to several cases of the motion of two-dimensional and three-dimensional undulatory plates, and the optimum results are obtained.","Qin-jian Qian

In this paper, we first develop the Sobolev regularity of the FFPEs with two internal states, including the homogeneous problem with smooth and nonsmooth initial values and the inhomogeneous problem with vanishing initial value, and then we design the numerical scheme for the system of fractional partial differential equations based on the finite element method for the space derivatives and convolution quadrature for the time fractional derivatives. The optimal error estimates of the scheme under the above three different conditions are provided for both space semidiscrete and fully discrete schemes. Finally, one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments are performed to confirm our theoretical analysis and the predicted convergence order.","Daxin Nie1, Jing Sun1 & Weihua Deng",Journal of Scientific Computing,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-020-01218-9,"Fractional Fokker–Planck equations,Multiple internal states,Finite element method,Convolution quadrature,Error analysis"

Numerically solving the equation with the time tempered fractional substantial derivative and tempered fractional Laplacian consists in discretizing these two non-local operators. Here, using convolution quadrature, we provide the first-order and second-order schemes for discretizing the time tempered fractional substantial derivative, which doesn’t require the assumption of the regularity of the solution in time; we use the finite difference method to approximate the two-dimensional tempered fractional Laplacian, and the accuracy of the scheme depends on the regularity of the solution on \({\bar{\varOmega }}\) rather than the whole space. Lastly, we verify the predicted convergence orders and the effectiveness of the presented schemes by numerical examples.","Daxin Nie1, Jing Sun1 & Weihua Deng

In the paper, the result is obtained not just for the operator, but also for an arbitrary parabolic differential operator, where is an elliptic operator in of an even order with constant coefficients. As an application, the usual Cauchy-Dirichlet boundary value problem for the homogeneous equation in is reduced to an integral equation in a thin lateral boundary layer.

Our preconditioned matrix is constructed by using a trigonometric polynomial θ(x,y) obtained from Fourier/kernel approximations or from the use of a proper interpolation scheme. Both of the above techniques produce a trigonometric polynomial θ(x,y) which approximates the generating function f(x,y), and hence the preconditioned matrix is forced to have clustered spectrum. As θ(x,y) is chosen to be a trigonometric polynomial, the preconditioner is a block band Toeplitz matrix with Toeplitz blocks, and therefore its inversion does not increase the total complexity of the PCG method. Preconditioning by block Toeplitz matrices has been treated in the literature in several papers. We compare our method with their results and we show the efficiency of our proposal through various numerical experiments.","D. Noutsos1, S. Serra Capizzano2 & P.

If an efflux pump can expel an antibiotic so that its concentration within the cell is below a killing threshold the bacteria are resistant to the antibiotic. Efflux pumps may be specific or they may pump various different substances. This is why many efflux pumps confer multi drug resistance (MDR). In particular over expression of the AcrAB−TolC efflux pump system confers MDR in both Salmonella and Escherichia coli. We consider the complex gene regulation network that controls expression of genes central to controlling the efflux associated genes acrAB and acrEF in Salmonella. We present the first mathematical model of this gene regulatory network in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations. Using a time dependent asymptotic analysis, we examine in detail the behaviour of the efflux system on various different timescales. Asymptotic approximations of the steady states provide an analytical comparison of targets for efflux inhibition.","George H. Youlden

In un sistema non lineare, gli autovalori possono cambiare considerevolmente nel corso della soluzione e un sistema che inizialmente si comporta bene può divenire «stiff», producendo aumento di costo del tempo di calcolo o inaccuratezza. Il lavoro contiene una discussione di varie definizioni della «stiffness» e diversi metodi per superarla, incluso un nuovo metodo d'identificazione e partizione di un sistema a due scale temporali in sottosistemi veloci e lenti.

2223,Numerical Solution of Systems of Linear Algebraic Equations with Ill-Conditioned Matrices,"AbstractSystems of linear algebraic equations (SLAEs) are considered in this work. If the matrix of a system is nonsingular, a unique solution of the system exists. In the singular case, the system can have no solution or infinitely many solutions. In this case, the notion of a normal solution is introduced. The case of a nonsingular square matrix can be theoretically regarded as good in the sense of solution existence and uniqueness. However, in the theory of computational methods, nonsingular matrices are divided into two categories: ill-conditioned and well-conditioned matrices. A matrix is ill-conditioned if the solution of the system of equations is practically unstable. An important characteristic of the practical solution stability for a system of linear equations is the condition number. Regularization methods are usually applied to obtain a reliable solution. A common strategy is to use Tikhonov’s stabilizer or its modifications or to represent the required solution as the orthogonal sum of two vectors of which one vector is determined in a stable fashion, while seeking the second one requires a stabilization procedure. Methods for numerically solving SLAEs with positive definite symmetric matrices or oscillation-type matrices using regularization are considered in this work, which lead to SLAEs with reduced condition numbers.",A.

Numerical oscillations typically occur in domains with large gradients of velocities, in particular, in the near-wall layer. It is proposed to single out the boundary layer and use a numerical scheme with increased numerical dissipation in it. The algorithm for singling out the boundary layer uses a switching function to change the parameters of the numerical scheme. This algorithm is formulated based on the BCD scheme from the family NVD. Its validity and advantages are investigated using the zonal RANS–LES approach for solving some problems of turbulent flow of incompressible fluids.","A. S. Kozelkov1, O. L. Krutyakova1, V. V.

In recent times, researches have found out that lots of physical processes illustrate fractional order characteristics that alters with time or space. The continuum of order in the fractional calculus permits the order of the fractional operator be accounted for as a variable. In the current research work, radial basis functions (RBFs) approximation is utilized for solving fractional mobile-immobile advection-dispersion (TF-MIM-AD) model in a bounded domain which is applied for explaining solute transport in both porous and fractured media. In this approach, firstly, the discretization process of the aforesaid equation with of convergence order \(\mathcal {O}(\delta t^{})\) in the t-direction is described via the finite difference scheme for \( 0< \alpha <1\). Afterwards, by help of the meshless methods based on RBFs, we will illustrate how to obtain the approximated solution.

2247,\({{\mathcal{L}}}_{1}\)-Optimal Filtering of Markov Jump Processes. I. Exact Solution and Numerical Implementation Schemes,"Part I of this research work is devoted to the development of a class of numerical solution algorithms for the filtering problem of Markov jump processes by indirect continuous-time observations corrupted by Wiener noises. The expected \({{\mathcal{L}}}_{1}\) norm of the estimation error is chosen as an optimality criterion. The noise intensity depends on the state being estimated. The numerical solution algorithms involve not the original continuous-time observations, but the ones discretized by time. A feature of the proposed algorithms is that they take into account the probability of several jumps in the estimated state on the time interval of discretization. The main results are the statements on the accuracy of the approximate solution of the filtering problem, depending on the number of jumps taken into account for the estimated state, on the discretization step, and on the numerical integration scheme applied. These statements provide a theoretical basis for the subsequent analysis of particular numerical schemes to implement the solution of the filtering problem.","A. V.

2251,Efficient Numerical Solution of the Density Profile Equation in Hydrodynamics,"
We discuss the numerical treatment of a nonlinear second order boundary value problem in ordinary differential equations posed on an unbounded domain which represents the density profile equation for the description of the formation of microscopical bubbles in a non-homogeneous fluid. For an efficient numerical solution the problem is transformed to a finite interval and polynomial collocation is applied to the resulting boundary value problem with essential singularity. We demonstrate that this problem is well-posed and the involved collocation methods show their classical convergence order. Moreover, we investigate what problem statement yields favorable conditioning of the associated collocation equations. Thus, collocation methods provide a sound basis for the implementation of a standard code equipped with an a posteriori error estimate and an adaptive mesh selection procedure. We present a code based on these algorithmic components that we are currently developing especially for the numerical solution of singular boundary value problems of arbitrary, mixed order, which also admits to solve problems in an implicit formulation. Finally, we compare our approach to a solution method proposed in the literature and conclude that collocation is an easy to use, reliable and highly accurate way to solve problems of the present type.

The proposed mathematical model takes into account the nonstationarity and three-dimensionality of the process of medium motion and rotation of the surface of the inner cylinder, as well as surface tension and the action of gravity. The developed numerical technique was tested on the solution of the problem of Couette–Taylor single-phase flow, which is the limiting case of a two-phase flow, when the volume concentration of the gas phase is zero. Two regimes of a two-phase flow are obtained. At low Reynolds numbers, a stratified flow regime is observed. In the second regime of two-phase flow, the gas phase is localized along a helical line along the surface of the inner cylinder. It is shown that the dimensionless torque increases when the gas phase is added to the flow.",I. V.

2255,Gradient stability of numerical algorithms in local nonequilibrium problems of critical dynamics,"The critical dynamics of a spatially inhomogeneous system are analyzed with allowance for local nonequilibrium, which leads to a singular perturbation in the equations due to the appearance of a second time derivative. An extension is derived for the Eyre theorem, which holds for classical critical dynamics described by first-order equations in time and based on the local equilibrium hypothesis. It is shown that gradient-stable numerical algorithms can also be constructed for second-order equations in time by applying the decomposition of the free energy into expansive and contractive parts, which was suggested by Eyre for classical equations. These gradient-stable algorithms yield a monotonically nondecreasing free energy in simulations with an arbitrary time step. It is shown that the gradient stability conditions for the modified and classical equations of critical dynamics coincide in the case of a certain time approximation of the inertial dynamics relations introduced for describing local nonequilibrium. Model problems illustrating the extended Eyre theorem for critical dynamics problems are considered.","P. K. Galenko1, V. G. Lebedev2 & A. A.

In such studies, the accuracy of determining the mass values is affected by hidden parameters (Coulomb interaction of analyzed ions with each other and with the walls of the mass-spectrometer trap).The problem consists in the development of a parallel computer code that allows simulation of the millions of charged ions and can reproduce the times of a real experiment in order to study the influence of Coulomb forces on the mass spectrum.The mathematical formulation of the original physical problem is presented. It is proposed to use the particle-in-cell method for simulation of the motion of ion clouds in the trap. The equations of motion are integrated with the use of a scheme with frequency correction.

2257,A numerical evaluation of solvers for the periodic Riccati differential equation,"Efficient and accurate structure exploiting numerical methods for solving the periodic Riccati differential equation (PRDE) are addressed. Such methods are essential, for example, to design periodic feedback controllers for periodic control systems. Three recently proposed methods for solving the PRDE are presented and evaluated on challenging periodic linear artificial systems with known solutions and applied to the stabilization of periodic motions of mechanical systems. The first two methods are of the type multiple shooting and rely on computing the stable invariant subspace of an associated Hamiltonian system. The stable subspace is determined using either algorithms for computing an ordered periodic real Schur form of a cyclic matrix sequence, or a recently proposed method which implicitly constructs a stable deflating subspace from an associated lifted pencil. The third method reformulates the PRDE as a convex optimization problem where the stabilizing solution is approximated by its truncated Fourier series. As known, this reformulation leads to a semidefinite programming problem with linear matrix inequality constraints admitting an effective numerical realization. The numerical evaluation of the PRDE methods, with focus on the number of states (n) and the length of the period (T) of the periodic systems considered, includes both quantitative and qualitative results.","Sergei Gusev1, Stefan Johansson2, Bo Kågström2, Anton Shiriaev3,4 & …Andras Varga",BIT Numerical Mathematics,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10543-010-0257-5,"Periodic systems,Periodic Riccati differential equations,Orbital stabilization,Periodic real Schur form,Periodic eigenvalue reordering,Hamiltonian systems,Linear matrix inequalities,Numerical methods"
2258,Some Numerical Extrapolation Methods for the Fractional Sub-diffusion Equation and Fractional Wave Equation Based on the L1 Formula,"With the help of the asymptotic expansion for the classic L1 formula and based on the L1-type compact difference scheme, we propose a temporal Richardson extrapolation method for the fractional sub-diffusion equation. Three extrapolation formulas are presented, whose temporal convergence orders in \(L_\infty\)-norm are proved to be 2, \(3-\alpha\), and \(4-2\alpha\), respectively, where \(0<\alpha <1\). Similarly, by the method of order reduction, an extrapolation method is constructed for the fractional wave equation including two extrapolation formulas, which achieve temporal \(4-\gamma\) and \(6-2\gamma\) order in \(L_\infty\)-norm, respectively, where \(1<\gamma <2\). Combining the derived extrapolation methods with the fast algorithm for Caputo fractional derivative based on the sum-of-exponential approximation, the fast extrapolation methods are obtained which reduce the computational complexity significantly while keeping the accuracy. Several numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.","Ren-jun Qi1 & Zhi-zhong Sun

Then, the outer region problem is solved as a two-point boundary-value problem (TPBVP), and an explicit terminal boundary condition is obtained.

                applied to locally Lipschitz mappings \(u : \mathbb {R}^n \supseteq \Omega \longrightarrow \mathbb {R}^N\), where \(n,N\in \mathbb {N}\). This is the model functional of Calculus of Variations in \(L^\infty \). The area is developing rapidly, but the vectorial case of \(N\ge 2\) is still poorly understood. Due to the non-local nature of (1), usual minimisers are not truly optimal. The concept of so-called absolute minimisers is the primary contender in the direction of variational concepts. However, these cannot be obtained by direct minimisation and the question of their existence under prescribed boundary data is open when \(n,N\ge 2\). We present numerical experiments aimed at understanding the behaviour of minimisers through a new technique involving p-concentration measures.

2261,Numerical investigation on aerodynamic performance of a bionic flapping wing,"This paper numerically studies the aerodynamic performance of a bird-like bionic flapping wing. The geometry and kinematics are designed based on a seagull wing, in which flapping, folding, swaying, and twisting are considered. An in-house unsteady flow solver based on hybrid moving grids is adopted for unsteady flow simulations. We focus on two main issues in this study, i.e., the influence of the proportion of down-stroke and the effect of span-wise twisting. Numerical results show that the proportion of down-stroke is closely related to the efficiency of the flapping process. The preferable proportion is about 0.7 by using the present geometry and kinematic model, which is very close to the observed data. Another finding is that the drag and the power consumption can be greatly reduced by the proper span-wise twisting. Two cases with different reduced frequencies are simulated and compared with each other. The numerical results show that the power consumption reduces by more than 20%, and the drag coefficient reduces by more than 60% through a proper twisting motion for both cases. The flow mechanism is mainly due to controlling of unsteady flow separation by adjusting the local effective angle of attack. These conclusions will be helpful for the high-performance micro air vehicle (MAV) design.","Xinghua Chang1, Laiping Zhang1, Rong Ma2 & …Nianhua Wang",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-019-2532-8,"flapping wing,bird-like flapping,unsteady flow,radial basis function (RBF),hybrid dynamic mesh,span-wise twisting mechanism"

2264,Richardson Extrapolation on Some Recent Numerical Quadrature Formulas for Singular and Hypersingular Integrals and Its Study of Stability,"Recently, we derived some new numerical quadrature formulas of trapezoidal rule type for the integrals \(I^{(1)}[g]=\int ^b_a \frac{g(x)}{x-t}\,dx\) and \(I^{(2)}[g]=\int ^b_a \frac{g(x)}{(x-t)^2}\,dx\). These integrals are not defined in the regular sense; \(I^{(1)}[g]\) is defined in the sense of Cauchy Principal Value while \(I^{(2)}[g]\) is defined in the sense of Hadamard Finite Part. With \(h=(b-a)/n, \,n=1,2,\ldots \), and \(t=a+kh\) for some \(k\in \{1,\ldots ,n-1\}, \,t\) being fixed, the numerical quadrature formulas \({Q}^{(1)}_n[g]\) for \(I^{(1)}[g]\) and \(Q^{(2)}_n[g]\) for \(I^{(2)}[g]\) are $$\begin{aligned} {Q}^{(1)}_n[g]=h\sum ^n_{j=1}f(a+jh-h/2),\quad f(x)=\frac{g(x)}{x-t}, \end{aligned}$$and $$\begin{aligned} Q^{(2)}_n[g]=h\sum ^n_{j=1}f(a+jh-h/2)-\pi ^2g(t)h^{-1},\quad f(x)=\frac{g(x)}{(x-t)^2}. \end{aligned}$$We provided a complete analysis of the errors in these formulas under the assumption that \(g\in C^\infty [a,b]\).

The probability density function (PDF) of Brownian functionals satisfies the Feynman–Kac formula, being a Schrödinger equation in imaginary time. The functionals of non-Brownian motion, or anomalous diffusion, follow the fractional Feynman–Kac equation (Carmi et al. in J Stat Phys 141:1071–1092, 2010), where the fractional substantial derivative is involved. Based on recently developed discretized schemes for fractional substantial derivatives (Chen and Deng arXiv:1310.3086), this paper focuses on providing algorithms for numerically solving the forward and backward fractional Feynman–Kac equations; since the fractional substantial derivative is non-local time-space coupled operator, new challenges are introduced compared with the ordinary fractional derivative. Two ways (finite difference and finite element) of discretizing the space derivative are considered. For the backward fractional Feynman–Kac equation, the numerical stability and convergence of the algorithms with first order accuracy are theoretically discussed; and the optimal estimates are obtained. For all the provided schemes, including the first order and high order ones, of both forward and backward Feynman–Kac equations, extensive numerical experiments are performed to show their effectiveness.","Weihua Deng1, Minghua Chen1 & Eli Barkai",Journal of Scientific Computing,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-014-9873-6,"Fractional Feynman–Kac equation,Fractional substantial derivative,Optimal convergent order,Numerical stability and convergence,Numerical inversion of Laplace transforms"

The process of determining roots of non-linear functions arise from many applications of various fields such as image and audio processing, mathematical analysis, fuzzy systems, fluid mechanics etc. Especially a nonlinear equation which involves exponential and logarithmic functions can be effectively approximated by using multiplicative methods. On the other hand, corresponding ordinary numerical methods work better for the given non-linear equation consists only polynomial function. Therefore, the idea of joined numerical methods consisting both ordinary and multiplicative methods should be considered for optimal solution. The derivation of Halley method provides a sufficient formation of joint root-finding methods to derive more accurate root finding methods. Prior to the derivation of these joint methods, multiplicative and Volterra Halley methods are derived based on respective Taylor theorems. Moreover, numerical results of the paper show that ordinary Halley method may not converge on an initial value. In this case, a multiplicative method converges for the same initial value.",Ali Özyapıcı,International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40819-020-0785-x,"Halley methods,Multiplicative calculus,Volterra calculus,Bigeometric calculus,Non-linear equations"

2272,A simple technique for calculation of numerical integration errors for physically meaningful functions,"A simple technique for calculation of numerical integration errors for physically meaningful functions is presented. In this paper, first the function classes are introduced that relate a function studied directly to a particular physical problem. The matrix elements defining a particular class of functions are then directly incorporated into the error formula. The proposed technique relies on the extension of the concept of the Taylor series. Since the standard Taylor series can be used for calculating the errors for smooth functions, in this paper the behaviour of the error in the immediate vicinity of discontinuity is considered only. The extended Taylor series is obtained by performing the Taylor series expansion on both sides of the discontinuity, using a matrix to describe the behaviour of the function at the discontinuity position and finally summing up all terms proportional to the function value and of all its derivatives. For illustration, several basic classes of physically meaningful functions are introduced and the extended Taylor series is derived. The series is then used to calculate the local error of the numerical integration.

A fully-discrete method based on the implicit–explicit (IMEX) Euler time-discretisation is formulated and dilation rates which act as indicators of the surface evolution are introduced. Under the assumption that the mesh preserves the Delaunay regularity under evolution, we prove a sufficient condition, that depends on the dilation rates, for the existence of invariant regions (i) at the spatially discrete level with no restriction on the mesh size and (ii) at the fully-discrete level under a timestep restriction that depends on the kinetics, only. In the specific case of the linear heat equation, we prove a semi- and a fully-discrete maximum principle. For the well-known activator-depleted and Thomas reaction–diffusion models we prove the existence of a family of rectangles in the phase space that are invariant only under specific growth laws. Two numerical examples are provided to computationally demonstrate (i) the discrete maximum principle and optimal convergence for the heat equation on a linearly growing sphere and (ii) the existence of an invariant region for the LESFEM–IMEX Euler discretisation of a RDS on a logistically growing surface.","Massimo Frittelli1, Anotida Madzvamuse2, Ivonne Sgura1 & …Chandrasekhar Venkataraman",Journal of Scientific Computing,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-018-0741-7,"Evolving surface,Dilation rate,Heat equation,Maximum principle,Reaction–diffusion,Invariant region"

Some widely used FCT algorithms contain a multiplicative constant that reduces the antidiffusion coefficient by ∼0.01%–0.1%. Replacing this constant with a smoothly varying function of velocity which equals unity when the Courant number vanishes causes the linear diffusion to go to zero when the flow velocity does. The use of a velocity-dependent antidiffusion coefficient minimizes numerical smearing of discontinuities and associated effects in the neighboring flow. Computational examples are presented. The residual diffusion for nonzero flow speeds is nonlinear and problem dependent. A method is presented for calibrating it in any given code in the context of a particular problem, and is applied to the FCT algorithms described here.","David L.

The algorithm and its program realization are tested on the problem about the cylinder rising behind the shock wave. The curves of variation in the cylinder velocity are drawn, and the explanation on the qualitative form of the curves for a different cylinder mass is given. For a particular mass, the dynamics of the relaxation process are analyzed from the viewpoint of the transient shock-wave patterns realized in the interaction between the shock wave and the cylinder.","D.

2309,Numerical Study of Nonlinear Heat Transfer from a Wavy Surface to a High Permeability Medium with Pseudo-Spectral and Smoothed Particle Methods,"Motivated by petro-chemical geological systems, we consider the natural convection boundary layer flow from a vertical isothermal wavy surface adjacent to a saturated non-Darcian high permeability porous medium. High permeability is considered to represent geologically sparsely packed porous media. Both Darcian drag and Forchheimer inertial drag terms are included in the velocity boundary layer equation. A high permeability medium is considered. We employ a sinusoidal relation for the wavy surface. Using a set of transformations, the momentum and heat conservation equations are converted from an (x, y) coordinate system to an (\(x, \eta )\) dimensionless system. The two-point boundary value problem is then solved numerically with a pseudo-spectral method based on combining the Bellman–Kalaba quasi linearization method with the Chebyschev spectral collocation technique (SQLM). The SQLM computations are demonstrated to achieve excellent correlation with smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) Lagrangian solutions. We study the effect of Darcy number (Da), Forchheimer number (Fs), amplitude wavelength (A) and Prandtl number (Pr) on the velocity and temperature distributions in the regime. Local Nusselt number is also computed for selected cases. The study finds important applications in petroleum engineering and also energy systems exploiting porous media and undulating (wavy) surface geometry. The SQLM algorithm is shown to be exceptionally robust and achieves fast convergence and excellent accuracy in nonlinear heat transfer simulations.","O. Anwar Bég1, S. S. Motsa2, T. A. Bég3, A. J.

The system considered in this work allows modeling of all modalities (patterns) governing from 1 to \( p+q+2 \) spirals of this attractor. Next, having given the system \(1-D \) of the multispiral chaotic attractor via saturated function series, the procedure for uncovering hidden bifurcations presented by Menacer et al, such hidden bifurcations are governed by a homotopy parameter \( \varepsilon \) while p and q are kept constant. This additional parameter, which is absent from the initial problem, is perfectly adapted to unfold the structure of the multispiral chaotic attractor. Following this new procedure, at the integration operation, before reaching the asymptotical attractor which possesses an even number of spirals, these latter are generated one after one until they reach their maximum number matching the value fixed by \( \varepsilon \), uncovering modalities of an odd number of spirals.

Trench (Linear Algebra Appl. 389:23–31, 2004) has theoretically studied the minimization problems and the related approximation problems of matrix equation AZ=W for (R,S)-symmetric matrices, using their structure properties and Moore-Penrose inverse. In this paper, we extend and develop these research in a totally different way using iterative methods. We propose two algorithms based on the idea of the classical Conjugate Gradient method (CG) and Conjugate Gradient Least Squares method (CGLS), to solve the more general equation AXB=C for (R,S)-symmetric matrices X. Some numerical results confirm the efficiency of these algorithms. More importantly, some numerical stability analysis on the approximation problem is given combining with numerical examples, which is not given in the earlier papers.","Jiao-fen Li1, Xi-yan Hu2 & Jing-jing Peng",Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computing,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12190-013-0677-x,"Inverse problems,(R,S)-symmetric matrix,Iterative method,Structural dynamic model updating,Perturbation analysis"

The problem has a propertyC, which implies that the solution is decreasing at the maximum-points. It is shown, that under rather general conditions, the solution tends to a constant, independent of both time and space. In the proofs, use is made of both the maximum norm and a weighted Euclidean norm.In order to study the numerical solution the problem is first discretized in the space-variable, preserving the propertyC. Finally, the problem is solved as a system of ordinary differential equations, making use of the propertyC to obtain not too pessimistic error estimations.

2342,A conservative numerical method for the fractional nonlinear Schrödinger equation in two dimensions,"This paper proposes and analyzes an efficient finite difference scheme for the two-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation involving fractional Laplacian. The scheme is based on a weighted and shifted Grünwald-Letnikov difference (WSGD) operator for the spatial fractional Laplacian. We prove that the proposed method preserves the mass and energy conservation laws in semi-discrete formulations. By introducing the differentiation matrices, the semi-discrete fractional nonlinear Schrödinger (FNLS) equation can be rewritten as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in matrices formulations. Two kinds of time discretization methods are proposed for the semi-discrete formulation. One is based on the Crank-Nicolson (CN) method which can be proved to preserve the fully discrete mass and energy conservation. The other one is the compact implicit integration factor (cIIF) method which demands much less computational effort. It can be shown that the cIIF scheme can approximate CN scheme with the error O(τ2). Finally numerical results are presented to demonstrate the method’s conservation, accuracy, efficiency and the capability of capturing blow-up.","Rongpei Zhang1, Yong-Tao Zhang2, Zhen Wang3, Bo Chen4 & …Yi Zhang",Science China Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-018-9388-9,"fractional nonlinear Schrödinger equation,weighted and shifted Grünwald-Letnikov difference,compact integration factor method,conservation"

The equation is solved without domain truncation and variable changing. First, the quasilinearization method is used to convert the equation to sequence of linear ordinary differential equations. Then, by using RJ collocation method equations are solved. For the evaluation, comparison with some numerical solutions shows that the proposed solution is highly accurate.

2346,Numerical solution of minimax optimal control problems by multiple shooting technique,"This paper presents the application of the multiple shooting technique to minimax optimal control problems (optimal control problems with Chebyshev performance index). A standard transformation is used to convert the minimax problem into an equivalent optimal control problem with state variable inequality constraints. Using this technique, the highly developed theory on the necessary conditions for state-restricted optimal control problems can be applied advantageously. It is shown that, in general, these necessary conditions lead to a boundary-value problem with switching conditions, which can be treated numerically by a special version of the multiple shooting algorithm. The method is tested on the problem of the optimal heating and cooling of a house. This application shows some typical difficulties arising with minimax optimal control problems, i.e., the estimation of the switching structure which is dependent on the parameters of the problem. This difficulty can be overcome by a careful application of a continuity method. Numerical solutions for the example are presented which demonstrate the efficiency of the method proposed.",H. J.

2350,Completing an Operator Matrix and the Free Joint Numerical Radius,"Ando’s classical characterization of the unit ball in the numerical radius norm was generalized by Farenick, Kavruk, and Paulsen using the free joint numerical radius of a tuple of Hilbert space operators \((X_1, \ldots , X_m)\). In particular, the characterization leads to a positive definite completion problem. In this paper, we study various aspects of Ando’s result in this generalized setting. Among other things, this leads to the study of finding a positive definite solution L to the equation $$\begin{aligned} L=I+\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^m\left[ \left( L^{\frac{1}{2}}X_j^*LX_jL^{\frac{1}{2}}+\frac{1}{4}I\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}+\left( L^{\frac{1}{2}}X_jLX_j^*L^{\frac{1}{2}}+\frac{1}{4}I\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}\right] , \end{aligned}$$which may be viewed as a fixed point equation. Once such a fixed point is identified, the desired positive definite completion is easily obtained. Along the way we derive other related results including basic properties of the free joint numerical radius and an easy way to determine the free joint numerical radius of a tuple of generalized permutations. Finally, we present some open problems.

Both of these methods enjoy the local flux conservation property. The local flux matching method finds a numerical solution in the same solution space of the DG type nonconforming element method, but it achieves much faster iterative convergence speed by embedding continuity requirement in the approximation functions rather than using constraint equations that are used in the DG type nonconforming element method. The merits of the proposed local flux matching method are as follows: the formulation of the method is simple and the solution satisfies local flux conservation property.

Existence, uniqueness of solutions and Ulam–Hyers stability results are displayed. To solve the considered equations a numerical approximation based on the shifted Legendre polynomials are proposed. To perform the method, an operational matrix of fractional derivative with variable-order is derived for the shifted Legendre polynomials to be applied for developing the unknown function. By substituting the aforesaid operational matrix into the considered equations and using the properties of the shifted Legendre polynomials together with the collocation points, the main equations are reduced to a system of algebraic equations. The approximate solution is calculated by solving the obtained system which is technically easier for checking. We also study the error analysis for the approximate solution yielded by the introduced method. Finally, the accuracy and performance of the proposed method are checked by some illustrative examples.

The method consists on reformulating the shallow water equations in a moving wetted domain where the wet/dry interface is located using the speed of the water flow. A set of parametrized coordinates is introduced and the underlying equations are transformed to a new hyperbolic system with advection terms to be solved in fixed domains. A well-balanced finite volume method is developed to approximate numerical solutions of the parametrized system.

At the interior grid points, the finite-difference approximation binds five neighboring values of the grid functions, which correspond to the five diagonals of the linear algebraic system matrix. The matrix is banded. The linear algebraic system is solved by decomposing the matrix into a product of an upper-triangular matrix and a lower-triangular matrix. The algorithm is implemented for complex matrices using double-precision arithmetic. We show how to use the grid function values obtained by solving the linear algebraic system to find the magnetic field at the corner point of the conductivity discontinuity boundary. Calculation of the field at the corner point of the conductivity discontinuity boundary is an independent difficult problem of mathematical modeling of electromagnetic fields in nonhomogeneous media that deserves special attention.

One of these solvers introduces an intermediate divergence free velocity for performing a temporal splitting (J. Comput. Phys.

Scient. Comput. [2000] 22(4), 1386–1410). The second uncoupling is known to be consistent with the harmonicity of the pressure field (SIAM J. Scient. Comput. [2000] 22(4), 1386–1410). Both solvers proceed by two steps, a pressure evaluation based on an extrapolated in time (of theoretical order J

The problem is considered in a two-dimensional (axisymmetrical) statement. For simulation, a system of equations of electron magnetic hydrodynamics (EMH) is solved, using splitting into physical processes. At the first stage, the ideal MHD with a frozen-in magnetic field is considered. An implicit variation differential scheme is constructed for the solution of the equations of ideal two-temperature magnetic hydrodynamics. The dynamics of the liner splitting is calculated at different values of the Hall parameters. With an increased value of the Hall parameters, the character of the magnetic field’s penetration into plasma changes radically and the field’s “tongues” penetrating along one of the electrodes are formed.",N.

2372,Numerical methods for fourth order nonlinear degenerate diffusion problems,"Numerical schemes are presented for a class of fourth order diffusion problems. These problems arise in lubrication theory for thin films of viscous fluids on surfaces. The equations being in general fourth order degenerate parabolic, additional singular terms of second order may occur to model effects of gravity, molecular interactions or thermocapillarity. Furthermore, we incorporate nonlinear surface tension terms. Finally, in the case of a thin film flow driven by a surface active agent (surfactant), the coupling of the thin film equation with an evolution equation for the surfactant density has to be considered. Discretizing the arising nonlinearities in a subtle way enables us to establish discrete counterparts of the essential integral estimates found in the continuous setting. As a consequence, the resulting algorithms are efficient, and results on convergence and nonnegativity or even strict positivity of discrete solutions follow in a natural way. The paper presents a finite element and a finite volume scheme and compares both approaches. Furthermore, an overview over qualitative properties of solutions is given, and various applications show the potential of the proposed approach.","Jurgen Becker1, Gunther Grun1, Martin Lenz1 & …Martin Rumpf",Applications of Mathematics,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B%3AAPOM.0000034537.55985.44,"thin film,fourth order degenerate parabolic equation,nonnegativity preserving scheme,surfactant driven flow,finite element method,finite volume method"

Its convergence properties are well known in the case of globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients. However, in many situations, relevant systems do not show a smooth behavior, which results in SDE models with discontinuous drift coefficient. In this work, we analyze the long time properties of the Euler scheme applied to SDEs with a piecewise constant drift and a constant diffusion coefficient and carry out intensive numerical tests for its convergence properties. We emphasize numerical convergence rates and analyze how they depend on the properties of the drift coefficient and the initial value. We also give theoretical interpretations of some of the arising phenomena. For application purposes, we study a rank-based stock market model describing the evolution of the capital distribution within the market and provide theoretical as well as numerical results on the long time ranking behavior.","S.

2375,Numerical simulation of effect of convection-diffusion on oxygen transport in microcirculation,"The entire process of oxygen transport in microcirculation by developing a 3D porous media model is calculated numerically with coupled solid deformation-fluid seepage-convection and diffusion. The principal novelty of the model is that it takes into account volumetric deformation of both capillary and tissues resulting from capillary fluctuation. How solid deformation, fluid seepage, and convection-diffusion combine to affect oxygen transport is examined quantitatively: (1) Solid deformation is more significant in the middle of capillary, where the maximum value of volumetric deformation reaches about 0.5%. (2) Solid deformation has positive influence on the tissue fluid so that it flows more uniformly and causes oxygen to be transported more uniformly, and eventually impacts oxygen concentration by 0.1%–0.5%. (3) Convection-diffusion coupled deformation and seepage has a maximum (16%) and average (3%) increase in oxygen concentration, compared with pure molecular diffusion. Its more significant role is to allow oxygen to be transported more evenly.",N. Zhao1 & K.

The general-purpose solvers have been modified to take advantage of the sparsity of the Jacobian matrices arising in the application of implicit methods. The obtained results show that general-purpose solvers, provided with suitable sparse matrix techniques, perform generally better than special-purpose ones.

2381,Numerical modeling of laser sintering of two-component powder mixtures,"The process of direct sintering of metal powders induced by laser radiation is investigated. A two-component mix of powders consisting of low- and high-melting components is considered. The model is based on a self-consistent nonlinear equation of continuity for volume fractions of low- and high-melting components of the mixture and on the equation of energy transfer in the melt-powder mixture system. It includes the motion of hard particles due to shrinkage associated with the changed density of the powder mixture and with convective fluxes caused by the forces of surface stress and gravitation. The liquid flow is determined by the Darcy law of filtration. The effect of the finite width of the region of phase transition of the high-melting powder has been detected. The rate of melting zone expansion is shown to depend on both the parameters of laser radiation (beam power) and on the physical characteristics of the substance of particles, and to grow with the increase in penetrability or phase transition heat. A diagram of the evolution quality of the melting front is obtained, by which it is possible to predict the solution behavior depending on the parameters of the powder mixture (penetrability and melting heat).","V.

The crack effect on wave propagation in the medium is taken into account by introducing cracks at the stage of grid generation with boundary conditions and conditions on the crack edges specified in explicit form. This method is used to obtain wave patterns near an extended inclined crack. The problem of numerically computing the seismic effect produced by a cluster of vertical and subvertical cracks is given in a complete three-dimensional formulation.

2386,Numerical Accuracy of Ladder Schemes for Parallel Transport on Manifolds,"Parallel transport is a fundamental tool to perform statistics on Riemannian manifolds. Since closed formulae do not exist in general, practitioners often have to resort to numerical schemes. Ladder methods are a popular class of algorithms that rely on iterative constructions of geodesic parallelograms. And yet, the literature lacks a clear analysis of their convergence performance. In this work, we give Taylor approximations of the elementary constructions of Schild’s ladder and the pole ladder with respect to the Riemann curvature of the underlying space. We then prove that these methods can be iterated to converge with quadratic speed, even when geodesics are approximated by numerical schemes. We also contribute a new link between Schild’s ladder and the Fanning scheme which explains why the latter naturally converges only linearly. The extra computational cost of ladder methods is thus easily compensated by a drastic reduction of the number of steps needed to achieve the requested accuracy. Illustrations on the 2-sphere, the space of symmetric positive definite matrices and the special Euclidean group show that the theoretical errors we have established are measured with a high accuracy in practice. The special Euclidean group with an anisotropic left-invariant metric is of particular interest as it is a tractable example of a non-symmetric space in general, which reduces to a Riemannian symmetric space in a particular case. As a secondary contribution, we compute the covariant derivative of the curvature in this space.","Nicolas Guigui

The computed results are presented for convective Mach numberMc = 0.8 andRe = 200 with initial data which have equal and opposite oblique waves. From the computed results we can see the variation of coherent structures with time integration and full process of instability, formation of A -vortices, double horseshoe vortices and mushroom structures. The large structures break into small and smaller vortex structures. Finally, the movement of small structure becomes dominant, and flow field turns into turbulence. It is noted that production of small vortex structures is combined with turning of symmetrical structures to unsymmetrical ones. It is shown in the present computation that the flow field turns into turbulence directly from initial instability and there is not vortex pairing in process of transition. It means that for large convective Mach number the transition mechanism for compressible mixing layer differs from that in incompressible mixing layer.","Dexun Fu1, Yanwen Ma1 & Linbo Zhang",Science in China Series A: Mathematics,2000,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02897166,"compressible mixing layer,transition,turbulence,compact scheme"

This technique is based on the Adomian decomposition method (ADM) and Green’s function. The technique relies on constructing Green’s function before establishing the recursive scheme for the solution components. In contrast to the existing recursive schemes based on ADM, the proposed recursive scheme avoids solving a sequence of nonlinear algebraic or transcendental equations for the undetermined coefficients. The approximate solution is obtained in the form of series with easily calculable components. For the completeness, the convergence and error analysis of the proposed scheme is supplemented. Moreover, the numerical examples are included to demonstrate the accuracy, applicability, and generality of the proposed scheme.

These systems of equations model the reversible reaction \(A+B \rightleftharpoons C\) in the presence of anomalous subdiffusion. The first model is based on the Henry & Wearne [1] model where the reaction term is added to the subdiffusion equation. The second model is based on the model by Angstmann, Donnelly & Henry [2] which involves a modified fractional differential operator. For both models the Keller Box method  [3] along with a modified L1 scheme (ML1), adapted from the Oldham and Spanier L1 scheme [4], are used to approximate the spatial and fractional derivatives respectively. Numerical prediction of both models were compared for a number of examples given the same initial and boundary conditions and the same anomalous exponents. From the results, we see similar short time behaviour for both models predicted. However for long times the solution of the second model remains positive whilst the Henry & Wearne based–model predictions may become negative.","Sheelan Osman

The equation under consideration is nonlinear and has variable coefficients. The original problem is transformed with the aid of Lie symmetries to an initial value problem (IVP) for a nonlinear third-order ordinary differential equation. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are examined, and the problem is consequently solved with the aid of a finite-difference scheme for various values of the governing parameters. In lieu of an exact symbolic solution, the scheme is validated by comparing the numerical solutions with the approximate analytic solutions obtained with the aid of the method of successive approximations in their region of validity. The accuracy, efficiency, and consistency of the scheme are demonstrated. Numerical solutions to the original initial boundary value problem are constructed for selected parameter values with the aid of the transforms. The qualitative behavior of the solutions as a function of the governing parameters is analyzed, and it is found that the examined IBVPs for generalized K(m, n) equations with variable coefficients that are functions of time, do not admit solitary wave or compacton solutions.","Marios A.

2419,A framework for exploring numerical solutions of advection–reaction–diffusion equations using a GPU-based approach,"In this paper we describe a general purpose, graphics processing unit (GP-GPU)-based approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) within advection–reaction–diffusion models. The GP-GPU-based approach provides a platform for solving PDEs in parallel and can thus significantly reduce solution times over traditional CPU implementations. This allows for a more efficient exploration of various advection–reaction–diffusion models, as well as, the parameters that govern them. Although the GPU does impose limitations on the size and accuracy of computations, the PDEs describing the advection–reaction–diffusion models of interest to us fit comfortably within these constraints. Furthermore, the GPU technology continues to rapidly increase in speed, memory, and precision, thus applying these techniques to larger systems should be possible in the future. We chose to solve the PDEs using two numerical approaches: for the diffusion, a first-order explicit forward Euler solution and a semi-implicit second order Crank–Nicholson solution; and, for the advection and reaction, a first-order explicit solution. The goal of this work is to provide motivation and guidance to the application scientist interested in exploring the use of the GP-GPU computational framework in the course of their research. In this paper, we present a rigorous comparison of our GPU-based advection–reaction–diffusion code model with a CPU-based analog, finding that the GPU model out-performs the CPU implementation in one-to-one comparisons.","Allen R.

A spatially varying nonlocal horizon parameter is adopted in the model, which measures the range of nonlocal interactions. Via heterogeneous localization, this can lead to the seamless coupling of the local and nonlocal models. We are interested in understanding the impact on singularity propagation due to the heterogeneities of the nonlocal horizon and the local and nonlocal transition. We first analytically derive equations to characterize the propagation of different types of singularities for various forms of nonlocal horizon parameters in the nonlocal regime.

2425,Numerical simulation of thermal bone necrosis during cementation of femoral prostheses,"The implant of a femoral prosthesis is a critical process because of the relatively high temperature values reached at the bone/cement interface during the cementation of the infibulum. In fact, the cement is actually a polymer that polymerizes in situ generating heat. Moreover, the conversion of monomer into polymer is never 100%; this is dangerous because of the toxicity of the monomer. In this paper, we present a 3-D axisymmetric mathematical model capable of taking into account both the geometry of the implant and the chemical/physical properties of the cement. This model, together with its numerical simulation, thus represents a useful tool to set up the optimal conditions for the new materials developed in this orthopaedic field. The real complex geometry is assumed to be a bone/cement/metallic system having cylindrical symmetry, thus allowing the model to be reduced to two space variables. The cementation process is described by the Fourier heat equation coupled with a suitable polymerization kinetics. The numerical approximation is accomplished by semi-implicit finite differences in time and finite elements in space with numerical quadrature. The full discrete scheme amounts to solve linear positive definite symmetric systems preceded by an elementwise algebraic computation. We present various numerical simulations which confirm some critical aspects of this orthopaedic fixing technique such as thermal bone necrosis and the presence of unreacted residual monomer.","S.

Based on [20], the “physically meaningful” solution, which is obtained via the Limiting Absorption Principle (LAP) and is called an LAP solution, is written as an integral of quasi-periodic solutions on a contour. The definition of the contour depends both on the wavenumber and the periodic structure. The contour integral is then written as the combination of finite propagation modes and a contour integral on a small circle. Numerical methods are developed and based on the two representations. Compared with other numerical methods, we do not need the LAP process during numerical approximations, thus a standard error estimation is easily carried out. Based on this method, we also develop a numerical solver for halfguide problems. The method is based on the result that any LAP solution of a halfguide problem can be extended to the LAP solution of a fullguide problem.

Based on the classical solution to the Hertzian contact problem, an invariant volumetric force function is proposed that depends on the geometric characteristics of interpenetration of two undeformed bodies. The normal forces computed using the force function agree with results obtained previously for non-Hertzian contact of elastic bodies. As an example, a ball bearing is used to compare the contact dynamics of elastic bodies simulated in the classical Hertzian model and its volumetric modification.","E. B. Aleksandrov1, V. G.

An earlier result of the author according to which the best parameters should be sought in the tangent space of the solution set of this system is now refined to show that the directions of the eigenvectors of a certain linear self-adjoint operator should be used for finding these parameters.

2431,A numerical study of the nonsteady transport of gases in the pulmonary capillaries,"A mathematical model is formulated for simulating the unsteady transport of gases in the blood flowing through the pulmonary capillaries. The formulation takes into account the transport mechanisms of molecular diffusion, convection and facilitated diffusion of the species due to haemoglobin. A time dependent situation is created by allowing to vary suddenly the partial pressures of the gases either in the venous blood or in the alveolar air. A numerical technique is described to solve the resulting time-dependent system of nonlinear coupled partial differential equations with the physiologically relevant boundary, entrance and initial conditions. The time required by the gases to achieve equilibrium is computed. It is shown that the dissolved oxygen takes longest in reaching equilibration whereas the carbon dioxide is the fastest. The various physiologically relevant unsteady situations have been examined.","Maithili Sharan1, A. Aminataei1 & M. P.

2433,On the effect of electron-mass variation in numerical simulations of the Farley-Buneman instability,"The Farley-Buneman instability is the plasma instability in the E region of the Earth’s ionosphere. Many studies on instability simulations use algorithms based on the particle method, which has many shortcomings. In particular, the solutions obtained with this method involve numerical noises owing to a finite number of the particles, since the electron mass is increased in order to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. In this study, the effect of an increase in the electron mass on the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the instability development process are considered. For this purpose, a software package developed on the basis of a mathematical model consisting of the Poisson equation for the electric potential, the fluid equation for electrons, and the kinetic equation for ions is used. The equations are solved numerically, which makes it possible to avoid the problems inherent in the particle method. An important result obtained in this paper is that even a slight increase in the electron mass leads to a considerable variation of the instability development parameters. This variation manifests itself as an increase in the wavelength of plasma fluctuations and a decrease in the strength of the turbulent electric field.","D. V. Kovalev1, A. P. Smirnov1 & Y. S.

And at the same time a three-dimensional mathematical model was established to simulate the whole flowing under different conditions. All the results predicted by the numerical calculation were substantiated by the experiments. The results were compared with experiential formula for obstructed round buoyant vertical jets in static ambient and it was found that the two concentration distributions had good accordance. Star shape of temperature isolines on cross-sections in the near areas from the disc was found and it was a very special figure for obstructed square buoyant vertical jets with a square disc.

The current paper proposes two new numerical methods for Euler equations with self-similar and quasi self-similar solutions respectively, which can use existing difference schemes for conservation laws and do not need to redesign specified schemes. Numerical experiments are implemented on one dimensional shock tube problems, two dimensional Riemann problems, shock reflection from a solid wedge, and shock refraction at a gaseous interface. For self-similar equations, one-dimensional results are almost equal to the exact solutions, and two-dimensional results also exhibit considerable high resolution. For quasi self-similar equations, the method can solve solutions that are not but close to self-similar, i.e. quasi self-similar, and this method can also achieve very high resolution when computing time is long enough.

Biol. 59, 1–22 were investigated. The models assumed the gamma distribution of the cycle time under either the geometric or Poisson elimination scheme. The reason for selecting these models was the fact that the probability density functions of the residence time of these models are formally similar to those of the Bateman and gamma-like function models, i.e., the two common deterministic models. Using published data, the analytical forms of the probability density functions of the residence time and the distributions of the simulated values of the residence time were determined on the basis of the deterministic models and the stochastic circulatory models, respectively. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed that even for 1000 xenobiotic particles, i.e., a relatively small number if the particles imply drug molecules, the probability density functions of the residence time based on the deterministic models closely matched the distributions of the simulated values of the residence time obtained on the basis of the stochastic circulatory models, provided that parameters of the latter models fulfilled selected conditions.","Gejza Wimmer1, Ladislav Dedík2, Marek Michal2, Andrea Mudríková2 & …Mária Ďurišová",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,1999,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1006/bulm.1998.0094,"Salicylic Acid,Probability Density Function,Cycle Time,Stochastic Model,Deterministic Model"

The set of such decay points plays a crucial role in checking, in a semi-global fashion, the local input-to-state stability of an interconnected system, and in the numerical construction of a LISS Lyapunov function. We provide a homotopy algorithm that computes a decay point of a monotone operator.

2446,Numerical method for finding 3D solitons of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation in the axially symmetric case,"A system of two nonlinear Schrödinger equations is considered that governs the frequency doubling of femtosecond pulses propagating in an axially symmetric medium with quadratic and cubic nonlinearity. A numerical method is proposed to find soliton solutions of the problem, which is previously reformulated as an eigenvalue problem. The practically important special case of a single Schrödinger equation is discussed. Since three-dimensional solitons in the case of cubic nonlinearity are unstable with respect to small perturbations in their shape, a stabilization method is proposed based on weak modulations of the cubic nonlinearity coefficient and variations in the length of the focalizing layers. It should be emphasized that, according to the literature, stabilization was previously achieved by alternating layers with oppositely signed nonlinearities or by using nonlinear layers with strongly varying nonlinearities (of the same sign). In the case under study, it is shown that weak modulation leads to an increase in the length of the medium by more than 4 times without light wave collapse. To find the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the nonlinear problem, an efficient iterative process is constructed that produces three-dimensional solitons on large grids.",O. V. Matusevich1 & V. A.

Both the simulation and the experiment reveal that the airfoil stall does not exist for the low turbulence intensity, however, occurs when the turbulence intensity increases sufficiently.

2449,Numerical Study of a Two-Phase Flow in a Centrifugal Dust Collector Based on a Two-Fluid Turbulence Model,"AbstractThe mathematical modeling of swirling turbulent flows is a difficult problem. The study of such flows using direct numerical simulation (DNS) or large eddy simulation (LES) models is computationally intensive. A numerical study of a two-phase turbulent flow inside a centrifugal dust collector based on the above methods is practically impossible today. Therefore, for studying such flows, turbulence models based on the closure of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS) are acceptable mathematical models. However, linear RANS models based on the Boussinesq hypothesis are not suitable for solving such problems. Boussinesq’s hypothesis assumes isotropic turbulence while anisotropic turbulence arises in the case of rotating flows. For small flow swirls, special corrections are introduced into the linear RANS models. With strong flow swirls, for example, as in centrifugal dust collectors, these corrections may be insufficient to obtain acceptable numerical solutions. Therefore, in such cases, it is recommended to use nonlinear RANS models, for example, based on Reynolds stresses. However, these models are too complex and cumbersome to study two-phase media. Recently, a new two-fluid turbulence model has emerged. This model is accurate and easy to implement when solving practical problems. Therefore, the aim of this study is to numerically study a two-phase turbulent flow inside a centrifugal dust collector based on a new two-fluid model. To verify the model, the obtained numerical results are compared with the experimental data. The paper also presents the results obtained using the linear SARC model.",Z. M. Malikov1 & F. Kh.

The governing equations have been solved using the finite volume method and to visualize the simulation results, fluent software has been employed. It is shown that the maximum value of pressure drop occurs on the upstream, and minimum value attains in the downstream section of the channel. It is ensured that an increase in the Reynolds number (Re) causes increase in normalize friction factor (F), and average Nusselt number (Nuav). The simulation results of this work will help to design and monitor flow phenomena through many thermal applications.

2451,Numerical study of flow in a constricted curved annulus: An application to flow in a catheterised artery,"The flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid in a curved annulus with a local constriction at the outer wall is investigated numerically. The three-dimensional nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations governing the flow are simplified by use of small curvature and mild constriction approximations. The simplified equations of motion, which are locally two-dimensional elliptic in nature at each cross-section, are solved numerically by means of the finite-difference method described by Collins and Dennis [Quart. Jour. Mech. Appl. Math. 28 (1975) 133–156]. Although the results are restricted to small curvature and mild constriction, these are valid for all Dean numbers D in the entire laminar flow regime. The numerical results show that, for higher values of radii ratio k, the pressure gradient, pressure drop, and frictional resistance increase considerably and they vary markedly across the constricted length. These results are used to estimate the increase in frictional resistance in an artery when a catheter is inserted into it. In the absence of constriction (δ1=0) and depending on the value of k ranging from 0⋅1 to 0⋅7, the frictional resistance increases by a factor ranging from 1⋅32 to 23⋅91 for D=500 and 1⋅20 to 16⋅56 for D=2000. But, in the presence of constriction (δ1 = 0⋅1) with the same range for k, the increase in frictional resistance is by a factor ranging from 1⋅34 to 42⋅32 for D=500 and 1⋅18 to 29⋅5 for D=2000. In a straight annulus, the increased factor ranges from 1⋅74 to 32⋅61 for δ1=0 and 1⋅78 to 58⋅27 for δ1 = 0⋅1 (for all Dean numbers D).",G. Jayaraman1 & R.K.

2458,Numerical study of the basic stationary spherical couette flows at low Reynolds numbers,"Previously developed iterative numerical methods with splitting of boundary conditions intended for solving an axisymmetric Dirichlet boundary value problem for the stationary Navier-Stokes system in spherical layers are used to study the basic spherical Couette flows (SCFs) of a viscous incompressible fluid in a wide range of outer-to-inner radius ratios R/r (1.1 ≤ R/r ≤ 100) and to classify such SCFs. An important balance regime is found in the case of counter-rotating boundary spheres. The methods converge at low Reynolds numbers (Re), but a comparison with experimental data for SCFs in thin spherical layers show that they converge for Re sufficiently close to Recr. The methods are second-order accurate in the max norm for both velocity and pressure and exhibit high convergence rates when applied to boundary value problems for Stokes systems arising at simple iterations with respect to nonlinearity. Numerical experiments show that the Richardson extrapolation procedure, combined with the methods as applied to solve the nonlinear problem, improves the accuracy up to the fourth and third orders for the stream function and velocity, respectively, while, for the pressure, the accuracy remains of the second order but the error is nevertheless noticeably reduced.

2459,Grid-Characteristic Numerical Method for Low-Velocity Impact Testing of Fiber-Metal Laminates,"The grid-characteristic numerical method (GCM) for hyperbolic equations systems is applied in many science fields—gas dynamics, hydrodynamics, plasma dynamics, etc. Its application for problems of dynamics of deformable solids is less popular, especially in comparison with finite elements methods. GCM shows good results and high performance for elastic wave problems in the approximation of small deformations—seismic survey and ultrasound non-destructive testing in medicine, aviation and railway industry. Low-velocity impacts (hail, dropped tool, bird strike, etc.) are one of the most dangerous load types for polymer composites. They cause barely visible impact damage (BVID) that can only be detected by a thorough ultrasound testing, but severely reduces the residual strength of the material, especially for a compression load along the surface. This testing increases the operating cost, and its necessity can be easily missed, which greatly reduces the reliability of polymer composites. Hybrid fiber-metal composites (GLARE, ARALL, titanium composite laminates) were developed to unify the advantageous properties of polymer composites and metal. The addition of a thin metal layer (1–2 mm) helps to reduce the impact vulnerability of polymer composites in case of a penetration or significant deformations of the material. The application of GCM for low-velocity impact problems can help to explain the damage pattern in fiber-metal composites in case of low-velocity strike, including delamination effects, by modelling elastic wave processes in the complex anisotropicmedium. This article contains the brief description of the GCM and numerical results that were obtained for model problems of a low-velocity impact on titanium composite laminates.","K. A. Beklemysheva1, A.

The solution explicitly determines the maximum amplitude and nonlinear beating period of the resonated wave. An observed bifurcation in the amplitude response is shown to correspond to the elliptic modulus approaching unity and the beating period of the interaction approaching infinity. The theoretical predictions compare favorably to fully nonlinear simulations of the sloshing process.

The model is formalized as a discrete dynamical system on a graph, which defines the scheme of possible interactions between the system’s elements. Typical evolutionary scenarios are described at the qualitative level. A simple generalization of the model, which allows modeling the evolution of the graph’s topology induced by the system’s dynamics, is discussed. Applications of the proposed model to the problem of simulating corruption (unethical behavior) are considered.","D. A. Zenyuk1, G. G. Malinetsky1 & D. S.

Secondly, various smoothers are examined in order to find an optimal multigrid method for the discrete system of equations. Numerical experiments confirm the stability and the second order accuracy, as well as fast multigrid convergence for a realistic poroelasticity experiment.","F. J. Gaspar1, F. J. Lisbona2 & C. W.

In this paper, the most popular models capable of adequately describing complex turbulent flows are considered as RANS models. Comparisons of models are carried out not only by the accuracy of the results obtained, but also by the consumption of computing resources for the implementation of these models. Therefore, the computational algorithm for all models was the same and the method of establishing, i.e., by integrating non-stationary equations, was used to achieve stationary solutions. For the numerical implementation of systems of hydrodynamic equations, a finite-difference scheme was used, where the viscous terms were approximated by the central difference implicitly, and for convective terms, an explicit scheme against the flow of the second order of accuracy was used. At each time step, the correction for the velocities was carried out through the pressure according to the S-IMPLE procedure. To assess the adequacy, the obtained numerical results are compared with the known experimental data. Comparisons of numerical results have shown that the two-fluid model is easy to implement, requires less computational resources than other RANS models and is able to predict turbulent flows with great accuracy.",Z.

Using the conditions constructed for the stability of the numerical solutions, we discuss the stability of two special numerical methods, namely the Euler–Maruyama method and the backward Euler–Maruyama method.

2506,A Numerical Method for Boundary Value Problems for a Homogeneous Equation with the Squared Laplace Operator with the Use of Interpolating Wavelets,"We present an effective numerical method for the recovery of biharmonic functions in a disk from continuous boundary values of these functions and of their normal derivatives using wavelets that are harmonic in the disk and interpolating on its boundary on dyadic rational grids. The expansions of solutions of boundary value problems into cumbersome interpolation series in the wavelet basis are replaced by sequences of their partial sums that are compactly presentable in the subspace bases of the corresponding multiresolution analysis (MRA) of Hardy spaces \(h_{\infty}(K)\) of functions harmonic in the disk. Effective estimates are obtained for the approximation of solutions by partial sums of any order in terms of the best approximation of the boundary functions by trigonometric polynomials of a slightly smaller order. As a result, to provide the required accuracy of the representation of the unknown biharmonic functions, one can choose in advance the scaling parameter of the corresponding MRA subspace such that the interpolation projection to this space defines a simple analytic representation of the corresponding partial sums of interpolation series in terms of appropriate compressions and shifts of the scaling functions, skipping complicated iterative procedures for the numerical construction of the coefficients of expansion of the boundary functions into series in interpolating wavelets. We write solutions using interpolating and interpolating-orthogonal wavelets based on modified Meyer wavelets; the latter are convenient to apply if the boundary values of the boundary value problem are given approximately, for example, are found experimentally. In this case, one can employ the usual, well-known procedures of discrete orthogonal wavelet transformations for the analysis and refinement (correction) of the boundary values.

In addition to pulsation characteristic, distributions of the mean coefficients of the viscous flow in the transient section of the streamlined surface are obtained, which enables one to determine the beginning of the laminar–turbulent transition and estimate the characteristics of the turbulent flow in the boundary layer.","I.

The resulting nonlinear algebraic systems of equations are solved by a damped version of Newton’s method. For the linear problems of the Newton iteration Krylov space methods are used. In computational experiments conducted for realistic subsurface (groundwater) contamination scenarios we show that the higher order approximation scheme significantly reduces the amount of inherent numerical diffusion compared to lower order ones. Thereby an artificial transverse mixing of the species leading to a strong overestimation of the biodegradation process is avoided.

2518,Stokes flow singularity at a corner joining solid and porous walls at arbitrary angle,"Motivated by the internal flow geometry of spiral-wound membrane modules with ladder-type spacers, we consider the Stokes flow singularity at a corner that joins porous and solid walls at arbitrary wedge angle \(\varTheta \). Seepage flux through the porous wall is coupled to the pressure field by Darcy’s law; slip is described by a variant of the Beavers–Joseph boundary condition. On a macroscopic, outer length scale, the singularity appears like a jump discontinuity in the normal velocity, characterized by a non-integrable 1 / r divergence of the pressure. For arbitrary \(\varTheta \), we develop an algebraic criterion to determine the admissible radial exponent(s) in a leading, inner similarity solution—which represents a weaker, integrable singularity in the pressure. A complete map of exponent versus \(\varTheta \) is provided for \(0< \varTheta < 2 \pi \): this has an intricate structure with infinitely many solution branches clustering around \(\varTheta = \pi \) and \(\varTheta = 2 \pi \). By generalizing the similarity form with a (\(\ln r\)) term and iterating on the slip and seepage conditions, we can carry the outer and inner power series to arbitrarily high order. Nevertheless, a numerical splice is required in between. For this purpose, we apply an iterative, numerical-asymptotic patching scheme described by Nitsche and Parthasarathi (J Fluid Mech 713:183–215, 2012). Detailed velocity and pressure profiles are calculated for three wedge angles (\(\varTheta = 3\pi /4, \pi /2, \pi /4\)) and two dimensionless slip lengths (\(\sigma = 20, 40\)). The general trends for decreasing wedge angle are (i) weakening of the pressure singularity, (ii) increasing magnitude of the radial component of velocity, and (iii) movement of the inner–outer transition farther from the corner. Wedges with \(\varTheta < \pi \) are seen to differ fundamentally from the flat wedge (\(\varTheta = \pi \)) previously considered by Nitsche and Parthasarathi

2519,New applications to invariant matrix norms and combinatorics of an integral representation of natural powers of the numerical values,"Let \(\vee ^k A\) be the k-th symmetric tensor power of \(A\in M_n(\mathbb {C})\).

In this paper, we first use this integral representation to construct a family of unitarily invariant norms on \(M_n(\mathbb {C})\) and then explore their relations to Schatten-norms of \(\vee ^k A\). Another application yields a connection between the analysis of symmetric gauge functions with that of complete symmetric polynomials. Finally, motivated by the work of Bhatia and Holbrook (Linear Algebra Appl 95:43–68, 1987), and as pointed out by Bhatia (Graduate texts in mathematics, 1996) concerning the development of the theory of weakly unitarily invariant norms, we provide an explicit form for the weakly unitarily invariant norm corresponding to the \(L^4\)-norm on the space \(C(\mathbb {S}^{n})\) of continuous functions on the sphere. Our results generalize those of Bhatia and Holbrook in different directions and we conclude with a method for computing those weakly unitarily invariant norms on \(M_n(\mathbb {C})\) that are associated to \(L^{2k}\)-norms on \(C(\mathbb {S}^{n})\).","Hassan A.

2521,Solving Non-linear Kolmogorov Equations in Large Dimensions by Using Deep Learning: A Numerical Comparison of Discretization Schemes,"Non-linear partial differential Kolmogorov equations are successfully used to describe a wide range of time dependent phenomena, in natural sciences, engineering or even finance. For example, in physical systems, the Allen–Cahn equation describes pattern formation associated to phase transitions. In finance, instead, the Black–Scholes equation describes the evolution of the price of derivative investment instruments. Such modern applications often require to solve these equations in high-dimensional regimes in which classical approaches are ineffective. Recently, an interesting new approach based on deep learning has been introduced byby E, Han and Jentzen [1, 2]. The main idea is to construct a deep network which is trained from the samples of discrete stochastic differential equations underlying Kolmogorov’s equation. The network is able to approximate, numerically at least, the solutions of the Kolmogorov equation with polynomial complexity in whole spatial domains. In this contribution we study variants of the deep networks by using different discretizations schemes of the stochastic differential equation. We compare the performance of the associated networks, on benchmarked examples, and show that, for some discretization schemes, improvements in the accuracy are possible without affecting the observed computational complexity.","Raffaele Marino

2522,On the Numerical Solution of the Stationary Power-Law Stokes Equations: A Penalty Finite Element Approach,"In this work, we study the penalty finite element approximation of the stationary power law Stokes problem. We prove uniform convergence of the finite element solution with respect to the penalized parameter under classical assumptions on the weak solution.

2523,"Semi-discrete optimal transport: hardness, regularization and numerical solution","Semi-discrete optimal transport problems, which evaluate the Wasserstein distance between a discrete and a generic (possibly non-discrete) probability measure, are believed to be computationally hard. Even though such problems are ubiquitous in statistics, machine learning and computer vision, however, this perception has not yet received a theoretical justification. To fill this gap, we prove that computing the Wasserstein distance between a discrete probability measure supported on two points and the Lebesgue measure on the standard hypercube is already \(\#\)P-hard. This insight prompts us to seek approximate solutions for semi-discrete optimal transport problems. We thus perturb the underlying transportation cost with an additive disturbance governed by an ambiguous probability distribution, and we introduce a distributionally robust dual optimal transport problem whose objective function is smoothed with the most adverse disturbance distributions from within a given ambiguity set. We further show that smoothing the dual objective function is equivalent to regularizing the primal objective function, and we identify several ambiguity sets that give rise to several known and new regularization schemes. As a byproduct, we discover an intimate relation between semi-discrete optimal transport problems and discrete choice models traditionally studied in psychology and economics. To solve the regularized optimal transport problems efficiently, we use a stochastic gradient descent algorithm with imprecise stochastic gradient oracles. A new convergence analysis reveals that this algorithm improves the best known convergence guarantee for semi-discrete optimal transport problems with entropic regularizers.","Bahar Taşkesen

2528,Numerical Solution of an Axisymmetric Eddy Current Model with Current and Voltage Excitations,"The aim of this paper is to study the numerical approximation of an axisymmetric time-harmonic eddy current problem involving an in-plane current. The analysis of the problem restricts to the conductor. The source of the problem is given in terms of boundary data currents and/or voltage drops defined in the so-called electric ports, which are parts of the boundary connected to exterior sources. This leads to an elliptic problem written in terms of the magnetic field with nonlocal boundary conditions. First, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution for a weak formulation written in terms of Sobolev spaces with appropriate weights. We show that the magnetic field is not the most appropriate variable to impose the boundary conditions when Lagrangian finite elements are used to discretize the problem. We propose an alternative weak formulation of the problem which allows us to avoid this drawback. We compute the numerical solution of the problem by using Lagrangian finite elements ad hoc modified on the vicinity of the symmetry axis. We provide a convergence result under rather general conditions. Moreover, we prove quasi-optimal order error estimates under additional regularity assumptions. Finally, we report numerical results which allow us to confirm the theoretical estimates and to assess the performance of the proposed method in a physical application which is the motivation of this paper: the computation of the current density distribution in a steel cylindrical bar submitted to electric-upsetting.","A.

2530,A numerical study on MHD double diffusive nonlinear mixed convective nanofluid flow around a vertical wedge with diffusion of liquid hydrogen,"The present study focuses on double diffusive nonlinear (quadratic) mixed convective flow of nanoliquid about vertical wedge with nonlinear temperature-density-concentration variations. This study is found to be innovative and comprises the impacts of quadratic mixed convection, magnetohydrodynamics, diffusion of nanoparticles and liquid hydrogen flow around a wedge. Highly coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (NPDEs) and boundary constraints have been used to model the flow problem, which are then transformed into a dimensionless set of equations utilizing non-similar transformations. Further, a set of NPDEs would be linearized with the help of Quasilinearization technique, and then, the linear partial differential equations are transformed into a block tri-diagonal system through using implicit finite difference scheme, which is solved using Verga’s algorithm. The study findings were explored through graphs for the fluid velocity, temperature, concentration, nanoparticle volume fraction distributions and its corresponding gradients. One of the important results of this study is that the higher wedge angle values upsurge the friction between the particles of the fluid and the wedge surface. Rising Schmidt number declines the concentration distribution and enhances the magnitude of Sherwood number. Nanofluid’s temperature increases with varying applied magnetic field. The present study has notable applications in the designing and manufacturing of wedge-shaped materials in space aircrafts, construction of dams, thermal systems, oil and gas industries, etc.","Prabhugouda Mallanagouda Patil1,2 & Madhavarao Kulkarni",Journal of the Egyptian Mathematical Society,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s42787-021-00133-8,"Magnetohydrodynamic flow (MHD),Nanoliquid,Quadratic convection,Quasilinearization technique"

We first derive an integral representation of the bilinear form corresponding to the variational problem. The numerical approximation of the action of the corresponding stiffness matrix consists of three steps: (1) apply a sinc quadrature scheme to approximate the integral representation by a finite sum where each term involves the solution of an elliptic partial differential equation defined on the entire space, (2) truncate each elliptic problem to a bounded domain, (3) use the finite element method for the space approximation on each truncated domain. The consistency error analysis for the three steps is discussed together with the numerical implementation of the entire algorithm. The results of computations are given illustrating the error behavior in terms of the mesh size of the physical domain, the domain truncation parameter and the quadrature spacing parameter.","Andrea Bonito1, Wenyu Lei1 nAff2 & Joseph E.

2535,On an Approach to the Numerical Solution of Dirichlet Problems of Arbitrary Dimensions,AbstractA method of the numerical solution of Dirichlet boundary value problems for nonlinear partial differential equations of the elliptic type and of arbitrary dimensions is proposed. It takes little memory and computer time for problems with smooth solutions. The method is based on modified interpolation polynomials with Chebyshev nodes to approximate the sought-for function and on a new approach to constructing and solving the linear algebraic problems corresponding to the initial differential equations. The spectra and condition numbers of the matrices formed by the algorithm are analyzed by using interval methods. Theorems on approximation and stability of the algorithm are proved in the linear case. It is shown that the algorithm provides a considerable decrease in computational costs as compared to the classical collocation and finite difference methods.,"B. V.

2536,A New Approach to Numerical Computation of Hausdorff Dimension of Iterated Function Systems: Applications to Complex Continued Fractions,"In a previous paper (Falk and Nussbaum, in \(C^m\) Eigenfunctions of Perron–Frobenius operators and a new approach to numerical computation of hausdorff dimension: applications in \(\mathbb {R}^1\), 2016. ArXiv e-prints arXiv:1612.00870), the authors developed a new approach to the computation of the Hausdorff dimension of the invariant set of an iterated function system or IFS and studied some applications in one dimension. The key idea, which has been known in varying degrees of generality for many years, is to associate to the IFS a parametrized family of positive, linear, Perron-Frobenius operators \(L_s\). In our context, \(L_s\) is studied in a space of \(C^m\) functions and is not compact. Nevertheless, it has a strictly positive \(C^m\) eigenfunction \(v_s\) with positive eigenvalue \(\lambda _s\) equal to the spectral radius of \(L_s\). Under appropriate assumptions on the IFS, the Hausdorff dimension of the invariant set of the IFS is the value \(s=s_*\) for which \(\lambda _s =1\). To compute the Hausdorff dimension of an invariant set for an IFS associated to complex continued fractions, (which may arise from an infinite iterated function system), we approximate the eigenvalue problem by a collocation method using continuous piecewise bilinear functions. Using the theory of positive linear operators and explicit a priori bounds on the partial derivatives of the strictly positive eigenfunction \(v_s\), we are able to give rigorous upper and lower bounds for the Hausdorff dimension \(s_*\), and these bounds converge to \(s_*\) as the mesh size approaches zero. We also demonstrate by numerical computations that improved estimates can be obtained by the use of higher order piecewise tensor product polynomial approximations, although the present theory does not guarantee that these are strict upper and lower bounds. An important feature of our approach is that it also applies to the much more general problem of computing approximations to the spectral radius of positive transfer operators, which arise in many other applications.",Richard S.

The air flow in this local exhaust ventilation system is solved using two approaches, namely, (i) a simple potential-flow model and seeking the solution of the resulting Laplace equation by means of a boundary-integral technique, and (ii) a turbulent model using the k-ε formulation and solving the resulting turbulent Navier-Stokes equations by means of a control-volume method and the SIMPLE algorithm. The effect of the angle α that the jet makes with the direction of the surface of the workbench and the momentum ratio on the air flow in the exhaust system are investigated. It is found that, by inclining the jet, the system can become more energy efficient and the region of capture of the contaminant from close to the bench can be increased.","X. Wen1, D.B. Ingham2 & B.

2539,Numerical simulation of flow fields and particle trajectories in ciliary suspension feeding,"A model describing the ciliary driven flow and motion of suspended particles in downstream suspension feeders is developed. The quasi-steady Stokes equations for creeping flow are solved numerically in an unbounded fluid domain around cylindrical bodies using a boundary integral formulation. The time-dependent flow is approximated with a continuous sequence of steady state creeping flow fields, where metachronously beating ciliary bands are modelled by linear combinations of singularity solutions to the Stokes equations. Generally, the computed flow fields can be divided into an unsteady region close to the driving ciliary bands and a steady region covering the remaining fluid domain. The size of the unsteady region appears to be comparable to the metachronal wavelength of the ciliary band. A systematic investigation is performed of trajectories of infinitely small (fluid) particles in the simulated unsteady ciliary driven flow. A fraction of particles appear to follow trajectories, that resemble experimentally observed particle capture events in the downstream feeding system of the polycheate Sabella penicillus, indicating that particles can be captured by ciliary systems without mechanical contact between particle and cilia. A local capture efficiency is defined and its value computed for various values of beat frequencies and other parameters. The results indicate that the simulated particle capture process is most effective when the flow field oscillates within timescales comparable to transit timescales of suspended particles passing the unsteady region near the ciliary bands. However, the computed retention efficiencies are found to be much lower than those obtained experimentally.",Stefan Mayer,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2000,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1006/bulm.2000.0190,"Particle Trajectory,Beat Frequency,Recovery Stroke,Ciliary Band,Particle Capture"

2544,Superconvergence Study of the Direct Discontinuous Galerkin Method and Its Variations for Diffusion Equations,"In this paper, we apply the Fourier analysis technique to investigate superconvergence properties of the direct disontinuous Galerkin (DDG) method (Liu and Yan in SIAM J Numer Anal 47(1):475–698, 2009), the DDG method with the interface correction (DDGIC) (Liu and Yan in Commun Comput Phys 8(3):541–564, 2010), the symmetric DDG method (Vidden and Yan in Comput Math 31(6):638–662, 2013), and the nonsymmetric DDG method (Yan in J Sci Comput 54(2):663–683, 2013). We also include the study of the interior penalty DG (IPDG) method, due to its close relation to DDG methods. Error estimates are carried out for both \(P^2\) and \(P^3\) polynomial approximations. By investigating the quantitative errors at the Lobatto points, we show that the DDGIC and symmetric DDG methods are superior, in the sense of obtaining \((k+2)\)th superconvergence orders for both \(P^2\) and \(P^3\) approximations. Superconvergence order of \((k+2)\) is also observed for the IPDG method with \(P^3\) polynomial approximations. The errors are sensitive to the choice of the numerical flux coefficient for even degree \(P^2\) approximations, but are not for odd degree \(P^3\) approximations. Numerical experiments are carried out at the same time and the numerical errors match well with the analytically estimated errors.","Yuqing Miao1, Jue Yan2 & Xinghui Zhong

In [(2005). Comput. Methods Appl. Mech.

2547,Stability analysis of pathogen-immune interaction dynamics,"The paper considers models of dynamics of infectious disease in vivo from the standpoint of the mathematical analysis of stability. The models describe the interaction of the target cells, the pathogens, and the humoral immune response. The paper mainly focuses on the interior equilibrium, whose components are all positive. If the model ignores the absorption of the pathogens due to infection, the interior equilibrium is always asymptotically stable. On the other hand, if the model does consider it, the interior equilibrium can be unstable and a simple Hopf bifurcation can occur. A sufficient condition that the interior equilibrium is asymptotically stable is obtained.

2552,Lagrangian-Eulerian Approach for Nonlocal Conservation Laws,"In this work, we construct and analyze a new fully discrete Lagrangian-Eulerian numerical method for the treatment of dynamics of conservation laws with nonlocal flux and influence of the source term in the solution. The scheme is based on the improved concept of no-flow curves. We use the recent results of S. Blandin & P. Goatin (2016), [Numer. Math. 132, 217-241], to obtain a BV estimate for the new fully discrete (explicit) Lagrangian-Eulerian scheme with a rigorous analysis to prove its convergence for the entropic solution. We also derive a weak CFL-type stability condition that does not require the derivative of the nonlocal flux as is the case for classical schemes. As an application of the proposed approach, we present a combined analytical-numerical study on the interplay between local and nonlocal conservation laws motivated by dynamics of differential equations such as traffic flow and related problems. For a suitable exponential kernel \(\omega _\eta \) of class \(C^2\), we present theoretical and numerical evidence that the limit of solutions to the nonlocal equation coincides with the unique entropy-admissible solution of the scalar conservation law \(\rho _t + (\rho ^m v(q))_x = 0\). It should be emphasized that hypotheses on the solution were verified numerically only. In this regard, the flux function \(f(\rho )=\rho ^m v(q)\) satisfies \(q(x,t)=\int _x^{x+\eta } \omega _\eta (x-y)\rho (y,t)dy\), for an integer \(1\le m\), where \(\omega _\eta \) is unitary (integral equals to 1) and non-increasing kernel such that \(\omega _\eta (s)=\frac{1}{(1-e^{-1/\eta ^2})\eta ^2} e^{-s/\eta ^2}\) for every \(s\in {\mathbb {R}}\). It turns out that we also use recent results of A. Bressan & W. Shen (2020), [Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 237, 1213-1236] and A. Bressan & W.

Two National Advisory Committee for Aeronatics (NACA) airfoils, NACA0012 and NACA0018, and two wind turbine airfoils, S809 and S825 are investigated. In addition, for low angles of attack, the flow field around the airfoil’s leading edge is investigated with the particle image velocimetry (PIV). The experimental results indicate that unsteady pressure disturbances on the airfoil surface are related to the rod vortex shedding.

It is shown how to treat the generalised orthogonal coordinate form of the equations in order to retain the numerical stability of the linearised equations when these are approximated by finite differences. A property analogous to diagonal dominance in more simple systems is shown to exist for the complete set of difference approximations to the flow equations so that the matrix of the finite-difference equations has all of its eigen values in the left-hand half-plane. It follows that the linearized equations are unconditionally stable. An entirely new difference scheme for the continuity equation is derived and shown to be superior to the more commonly used “central-difference” approximations for the high-Reynolds-number flow considered.

Based on the projection method, a new finite-difference algorithm on a staggered grid is employed to solve the laminar magnetohydrodynamic natural convection problems, which involves the second-order central scheme for the discretization of non-Newtonian viscous terms. To assess numerical capability of the newly proposed algorithm, the calculation results for Newtonian fluid in the square cavity show excellent agreement with results available in the literature. Research work has been performed for the certain pertinent parameters of Rayleigh number (\(10^{4}\) and \(10^{5}\)) and Prandtl number (\(Pr=0.065\)) using the new numerical algorithm. The computed results show that the natural convection of Carreau fluid is not only determined by the strength of the magnetic field, but also influenced by the inclination angle. In particular, when the Carreau fluid describes a non-Newtonian fluid, it is found that the inclination angle plays a large role on flow and heat transfer.","Yu. I. Dimitrienko1 & Shuguang Li

This equation is obtained by adopting the generalized Caputo fractional derivative instead of the classical integer order derivative. The significant benefit of fractional derivatives is their nonlocal property and the capability to provide detailed and precise analysis of the model.

In this technique, the discretizations for time and space do not depend on each other, which is its most significant advantage. Hence, we have the liberty to employ two different basis functions, namely radial basis functions and the Chebyshev polynomials in space and time, respectively.

2581,Semi-implicit methods for advection equations with explicit forms of numerical solution,We present a parametric family of semi-implicit second order accurate numerical methods for non-conservative and conservative advection equation for which the numerical solutions can be obtained in a fixed number of forward and backward alternating substitutions. The methods use a novel combination of implicit and explicit time discretizations for one-dimensional case and the Strang splitting method in several dimensional case. The methods are described for advection equations with a continuous variable velocity that can change its sign inside of computational domain. The methods are unconditionally stable in the non-conservative case for variable velocity and for variable numerical parameter. Several numerical experiments confirm the advantages of presented methods including an involvement of differential programming to find optimized values of the variable numerical parameter.,"Peter Frolkovič1, Svetlana Krišková1, Michaela Rohová1 & …Michal Žeravý",Japan Journal of Industrial and Applied Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13160-022-00525-y,"Advection equation,Semi-implicit method,Unconditional stability,Conservation laws"

Using convex duality, we reduce the solution of the boundary control problems to the solution of identification problems for the initial data of an adjoint heat equation. To solve these identification problems, we use a combination of finite difference methods for the time discretization, finite element methods for the space discretization, and of conjugate gradient and operator splitting methods for the iterative solution of the discrete control problems. We apply then the above methodology to the solution of exact and approximate boundary controllability test problems in two space dimensions. The numerical results validate the methods discussed in this article and clearly show the computational advantage of using second-order accurate time discretization methods to approximate the control problems.","C.

The value function usually corresponds to a solution of the adjoint equation. Conditions under which the value modeling of the initial distribution reduces the variance compared to the direct simulation are obtained. It is proved that the variance of the weighted estimate is bounded in the case of the partial value modeling. This proposition provides a basis for a method for determining whether or not the variance of the weighted estimate is bounded. This method uses the majorizing adjoint equation. Using a practically important problem in transport theory as an example, the asymptotic optimization of the distribution of the mean free path is presented.

The comparison shows that the properly calibrated 1D model gives accurate predictions of mass flow rate and turbine performance at much less computational time than the full 3D CFD method. On the other hand, the more expensive 3D CFD method does not need any specific calibration and allows detailed inspections of the flow fields.","Jiří Fürst

Two sets of boundary conditions (BCs) are analyzed, i.e., a constant (Case 1) and a linear streamwise variation of nanoparticle volume fraction and wall temperature (Case 2). The governing equations and BCs are reduced to a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and the corresponding BCs, respectively. The dependencies of solutions on Prandtl number Pr, Lewis number Le, Brownian motion number Nb, and thermophoresis number Nt are studied in detail. The results show that the reduced Nusselt number and the reduced Sherwood number increase for the BCs of Case 2 compared with Case 1. The increases of Nb, Nt, and Le numbers cause a decrease of the reduced Nusselt number, while the reduced Sherwood number increases with the increase of Nb and Le numbers. For low Prandtl numbers, an increase of Nt number can cause to decrease in the reduced Sherwood number, while it increases for high Prandtl numbers.","M. Salari1, M. Mohammadtabar2 & A.

2602,A thin double layer analysis of asymmetric rectified electric fields (AREFs),"We use perturbation methods to analyze the “asymmetric rectified electric field (AREF)” generated when an oscillating voltage is applied across a model electrochemical cell consisting of a binary, asymmetric electrolyte bounded by planar, parallel, blocking electrodes. The AREF refers to the steady component of the electric potential gradient within the electrolyte, as discovered via numerics by Hashemi Amrei et. al. (Phys Rev Lett 121(18):185504). We adopt the Poisson–Nernst–Planck framework for ion transport in dilute electrolytes, taking into account unequal ionic diffusivities. We consider the mathematically singular, and practically relevant, limit of thin Debye layers, \(1/(\kappa L) = \epsilon \rightarrow 0 \), where \(\kappa ^{-1}\) is the Debye length, and L is the length of the half-cell. The dynamics of the electric potential and ionic strength in the “bulk” electrolyte (i.e., outside the Debye layers) are solved subject to effective boundary conditions obtained from consideration of the Debye-scale transport. We specifically analyze the case when the applied voltage has a frequency comparable to the inverse bulk ion diffusion time scale, \(\omega = {\mathcal {O}}(D_A/L^2)\), where \(D_A = 2D_+ D_-/(D_+ + D_-)\) is the ambipolar diffusivity, and \(D_{\pm }\) are the ionic diffusivities. In this regime, the AREF extends throughout the bulk of the cell, varying on a lengthscale proportional to \( \sqrt{D_A /\omega }\), and has a magnitude of \({\mathcal {O}}(\epsilon ^2 k_B T /(L e))\) to leading order in \(\epsilon \). Here, \(k_B\) is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and e is the charge on a proton. We obtain an analytical approximation for the AREF at weak voltages, \(V_0 \ll k_B T/e\), where \(V_0\) is the amplitude of the voltage, for which the AREF is \({\mathcal {O}}(\epsilon ^2 V_0^2 e /(k_B T L))\). Our asymptotic scheme is also used to calculate a numerical approximation to the AREF that is valid up to logarithmically large voltages, \(V_0 = {\mathcal {O}}((k_B T/e)\ln (1/\epsilon ))\). The existence of an AREF implies that a charged colloidal particle undergoes net electrophoretic motion under the applied oscillatory voltage. Additionally, a gradient in the bulk ionic strength, caused by the difference in ionic diffusivities, leads to rectified diffusiophoretic particle motion. Here, we predict the electrophoretic and diffusiophoretic velocities for a rigid, spherical, colloidal particle. The diffusiophoretic velocity is comparable in magnitude to the electrophoretic velocity, and can thus affect particle motion in an AREF significantly.","Bhavya Balu1 & Aditya S. Khair

The top displacement of the inner stereocilia along the cross section of the basilar membrane (the x-displacement) is similar to the available data in the literature, which verifies the correctness of the model. Based on Castigliano’s theorem, the displacement of a single stereocilium is achieved under the inverted triangle force. The results are in good agreement with the data obtained from the finite element (FE) model, which confirms the validity of the formula. With the FE model, the effects of the movement of the hair cells and fluid in the cochlear duct on the x-displacements of the inner stereocilia are studied. The results show that the movement of the hair cells affects the x-displacements of the inner stereocilia, especially for the shortest stereocilium, and the fluid in the cochlear duct affects the x-displacements of the inner stereocilia, especially for the middle stereocilium. Moreover, compared with the effects of the hair cells on the stereocilia, the effect of the cochlear duct fluid is greater.",Wenjuan Yao1 & Yiqiang Chen,Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-017-2211-6,"inner stereocilium,Castigliano’s theorem,cochlear duct"

A common model used in these contexts is the so-called drift–flux model where the slip velocity (the difference between the velocities of the gas and of the liquid) is expressed on the basis of empirical correlations. However, depending on these empirical correlations, these models are not always hyperbolic and this induces severe mathematical and numerical difficulties. Using asymptotic analysis in the limit of large drag terms, we propose an Eulerian mixture model where the slip velocity is expressed under the form of a Darcy-like law.

2611,An entropy satisfying two-speed relaxation system for the barotropic Euler equations: application to the numerical approximation of low Mach number flows,"In the first part of this work, we introduce a new relaxation system in order to approximate the solutions to the barotropic Euler equations. We show that the solutions to this two-speed relaxation model can be understood as viscous approximations of the solutions to the barotropic Euler equations under appropriate sub-characteristic conditions. Our relaxation system is a generalization of the well-known Suliciu relaxation system, and it is entropy satisfying. A Godunov-type finite volume scheme based on the exact resolution of the Riemann problem associated with the relaxation system is deduced, as well as its stability properties. In the second part of this work, we show how the new relaxation approach can be successfully applied to the numerical approximation of low Mach number flows. We prove that the underlying scheme satisfies the well-known asymptotic-preserving property in the sense that it is uniformly (first-order) accurate with respect to the Mach number, and at the same time it satisfies a fully discrete entropy inequality. This discrete entropy inequality allows us to prove strong stability properties in the low Mach regime. At last, numerical experiments are given to illustrate the behaviour of our scheme.

For the constructed full-discrete scheme, the spatial derivative terms approximated with the helping of the collocation method based on the Legendre basis.

2639,A Numerical Strategy for Freestream Preservation of the High Order Weighted Essentially Non-oscillatory Schemes on Stationary Curvilinear Grids,"The weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes have been extensively employed for the simulation of complex flow fields due to their high order accuracy and good shock-capturing properties. However, the standard finite difference WENO scheme cannot hold freestream automatically in general curvilinear coordinates. Numerical errors from non-preserved freestream can hide small scales such as turbulent flow structures; aero-acoustic waves which can make the results inaccurate or even cause the simulation failure. To address this issue, a new numerical strategy to ensure freestream preservation properties of the WENO schemes on stationary curvilinear grids is proposed in this paper. The essential idea of this approach is to offset the geometrically induced errors by proper discretization of the metric invariants. It includes the following procedures: (1) the metric invariants are retained in the governing equations and the full forms of the transformed equations on the general curvilinear coordinates are solved; (2) the symmetrical, conservative form of the metrics instead of the original ones are used; (3) the WENO schemes which are applied for the inviscid fluxes of the governing equations are employed to compute the outer-level partial derivatives of the metric invariants. In other words, the outer-level derivative operators for the metric invariants are kept the same with those for the corresponding inviscid fluxes. It is verified theoretically in this paper that by using this approach, the WENO schemes hold the freestream preservation properties naturally and thus work well in the generalized coordinate systems. For some well-known WENO schemes, the derivative operators for the metric invariants are explicitly expressed and thus this approach can be straightforwardly employed. The effectiveness of this strategy is validated by several benchmark test cases.","Yujie Zhu1, Zhensheng Sun

2643,"Numerical Factorization of Propagation Operator for Hyperbolic Equations and Application to One-way, True Amplitude One-way Equations and Bremmer Series","This paper presents a purely numerical factorization of the propagation operator for a generic hyperbolic equation, based on the work of Towne & Colonius in 2015, that does not require heavy analytical development. This method is applied to form one-way equations with the objective of computing the propagation of waves inside a medium. The main advantage of this formulation is that pseudo eigenvectors and eigenvalues matrices are built, leading to the possibility to use the one-way equations into a true amplitude formalism and/or inside a Bremmer series. These two methods allow an extension of the domain of application of the one-way equations when the medium of propagation presents variations along the privileged direction. In particular, these formulations allow to take into account the phenomena of reflection and refraction of the incident wave. Finally numerical results are presented on different 2D situations based on the linearized Euler equations and compared to the results obtained with a full wave resolution. The issues of both the accuracy and the requirements in computational resources of the one-way resolution are also addressed.","Clément Rudel

A numerical-analytical method for analyzing the behavior of the system is developed in the case when observations contain not only counts of an integral curve and fluctuation noise, but also counts of singular disturbance.

2646,Testing random number generators by numerical modeling of an exactly solvable problem,"Monte Carlo numerical modeling of a problem with a known exact solution is used to test linear multiplicative generators with modulus M = 231 − 1 for their applicability in parallel computing. The deviations of the calculated values of the rotational temperature from the known theoretical values are compared with the possible errors of the Monte Carlo method due to the finiteness of statistical samples. In addition, sample correlation coefficients are used to estimate true correlation coefficients between the values of the rotational temperature obtained on different processors with different multipliers, as well as in the case where additional samples were drawn at the terminal state on each processor in order to increase the size of the total sample. For this purpose, by means of special partial averaging, the random values of the rotational temperature were transformed into approximately normally distributed variables; then, for the variables obtained, true correlation coefficients were estimated by sample correlation coefficients. It was discovered that 204 different multipliers suggested by G.S. Fishman, L.R. Moore exhibit the best performance when used in a parallel implementation of the Monte Carlo method: all deviations are less than the theoretical Monte Carlo errors. Moreover, no correlations between the random variables produced by generators with different multipliers were detected. This suggests that generators with different multipliers produce independent sequences of pseudorandom numbers. However, drawing additional samples on each processor, which is frequently done to increase the size of the total sample, gives rise to correlations. Moreover, in many such cases, the theoretical errors of the Monte Carlo method for multipliers in the bottom part of the list proposed by Fishman and Moore are less than the values of temperature deviations and, therefore, should not be used in this way.",V.

2652,Uniformly accurate numerical schemes for highly oscillatory Klein–Gordon and nonlinear Schrödinger equations,"This work is devoted to the numerical simulation of nonlinear Schrödinger and Klein–Gordon equations. We present a general strategy to construct numerical schemes which are uniformly accurate with respect to the oscillation frequency. This is a stronger feature than the usual so called “Asymptotic preserving” property, the last being also satisfied by our scheme in the highly oscillatory limit. Our strategy enables to simulate the oscillatory problem without using any mesh or time step refinement, and the orders of our schemes are preserved uniformly in all regimes. In other words, since our numerical method is not based on the derivation and the simulation of asymptotic models, it works in the regime where the solution does not oscillate rapidly, in the highly oscillatory limit regime, and in the intermediate regime with the same order of accuracy. In the same spirit as in Crouseilles et al. (J Comput Phys 248, 287–308, 2013), the method is based on two main ingredients. First, we embed our problem in a suitable “two-scale” reformulation with the introduction of an additional variable. Then a link is made with classical strategies based on Chapman–Enskog expansions in kinetic theory despite the dispersive context of the targeted equations, allowing to separate the fast time scale from the slow one. Uniformly accurate schemes are eventually derived from this new formulation and their properties and performances are assessed both theoretically and numerically.","Philippe Chartier1, Nicolas Crouseilles1, Mohammed Lemou1,2 & …Florian Méhats1,",Numerische Mathematik,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-014-0638-9,"35Q55,74Q10,65M12"

The method uses a patchy technique to build local Taylor polynomial approximations defined on small domains, which are then patched together to create a piecewise smooth approximation. The numerical domain is dynamically computed as the level sets of the value function are propagated in reverse time under the closed-loop dynamics. The patch domains are constructed such that their radial boundaries are contained in the level sets of the value function and their lateral boundaries are constructed as invariant sets of the closed-loop dynamics. To minimize the computational effort, an adaptive subdivision algorithm is used to determine the number of patches on each level set depending on the relative error in the dynamic programming equation. Numerical tests in 2D and 3D are given to illustrate the accuracy of the method.",Cesar O. Aguilar1 & Arthur J.

2655,A General Non-hydrostatic Hyperbolic Formulation for Boussinesq Dispersive Shallow Flows and Its Numerical Approximation,"In this paper, we propose a novel first-order reformulation of the most well-known Boussinesq-type systems that are used in ocean engineering. This has the advantage of collecting in a general framework many of the well-known systems used for dispersive flows. Moreover, it avoids the use of high-order derivatives which are not easy to treat numerically, due to the large stencil usually needed. These first-order PDE dispersive systems are then approximated by a novel set of first-order hyperbolic equations. Our new hyperbolic approximation is based on a relaxed augmented system in which the divergence constraints of the velocity flow variables are coupled with the other conservation laws via an evolution equation for the depth-averaged non-hydrostatic pressures. The most important advantage of this new hyperbolic formulation is that it can be easily discretized with explicit and high-order accurate numerical schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws. There is no longer need of solving implicitly some linear system as it is usually done in many classical approaches of Boussinesq-type models. Here a third-order finite volume scheme based on a CWENO reconstruction has been used. The scheme is well-balanced and can treat correctly wet–dry areas and emerging topographies. Several numerical tests, which include idealized academic benchmarks and laboratory experiments are proposed, showing the advantage, efficiency and accuracy of the technique proposed here.","C.

The evaluation of the length of a curve, represented in an Eulerian way as the zero level set of an implicit function, depends mainly on the representation of the curve.

We will analyze this parameter, its properties and its relations with the regularity of the curve.

2657,MEMS with fringing field: curvature-dependent electrostatic field and numerical techniques for recovering the membrane profile,"As known, a 1D membrane MEMS semi-linear elliptic model with fringing field can be written as $$\begin{aligned} u''=-\frac{\lambda ^2(1+\delta |u'|^2)}{(1-u)^2}\;\;\;\text {in}\;\;\varOmega \subset {\mathbb {R}}, \;\;u=0\;\;\text {on}\;\;\partial \varOmega , \end{aligned}$$where \(\lambda ^2\) and \(\delta \) are positive parameters and u is the deflection of the membrane. Since the electric field \( {\mathbf {E}} \) on the membrane is locally orthogonal to the straight tangent line to the membrane, \(|{\mathbf {E}}|\) can be considered locally proportional to the curvature K of the membrane, so that a well-known model with fringing field in which \(|{\mathbf {E}}|^2\propto \lambda ^2/(1-u)^2\) has been here considered. In this paper, starting from this model, we present a new algebraic condition of uniqueness for the solution of this model depending on the electromechanical properties of the material constituting the membrane, which weighs more than the condition of existence known in literature. Furthermore, shooting-Dekker–Brent, Keller-Box-scheme, and III/IV Stage Lobatto IIIA formulas were exploited and their performances compared to recover u under convergence conditions in the presence/absence of ghost solutions. Finally, a criterion that is able to choose the material constituting the membrane starting from the applied electric voltage V and vice versa, in conditions of convergence, and in the presence and absence of ghost solutions, is presented.","Mario Versaci

2672,Numerical study of the Couette flow of a diatomic rarefied gas,"The Couette flow is numerically studied using a model kinetic equation for a diatomic rarefied gas (nitrogen). The boundary condition set on the wall takes into account that the molecular rotational energy passes into translational energy when the molecule interacts with the wall. For comparison purposes, the Couette flow is computed using the classical diffuse model of the gas-wall interaction. A comparison of the results obtained with both types of boundary conditions shows that the computed parameters of the Couette flow coincide only for sufficiently low Knudsen numbers. This suggests that transitions between rotational and translational energy in the gas-wall interaction have to be taken into account in the boundary condition.",I. A. Kostromin1 & V. A.

2673,Comparative verification of discrete and smeared numerical approaches for the simulation of hydraulic fracturing,"The numerical treatment of propagating fractures as embedded discontinuities is a challenging task for which an analyst has to select a suitable numerical method from a range of options. Since their inception in the mid-80s, smeared approaches for fracture simulation such as non-local damage, gradient damage or more lately phase-field modelling have steadily gained popularity. One of the appeals of a smeared implicit fracture representation, the ability to handle complex topologies with unknown crack paths in relatively coarse meshes as well as multiple-crack interaction and multiphysics, is a fundamental requirement for the numerical simulation of hydraulic fracturing in complex situations which is technically more difficult to achieve with many other methods. However, in hydraulic fracturing simulations, not only the prediction of the fracture path but also the computation of fracture width and propagation pressure (frac pressure) is crucial for reliable and meaningful applications of the simulation tool; how to determine some of these quantities in smeared representations is not immediately obvious. In this study, two of the most popular smeared approaches of recent, namely non-local damage and phase-field models, and an approach in which the solution space is locally enriched to capture a strong discontinuity combined with a cohesive-zone model are verified against fundamental hydraulic fracture propagation problems in the toughness-dominated regime. The individual theoretical foundations of each approach are discussed and differences in the treatment of physical and numerical properties of the methods when applied to the same physical problems are highlighted through examples.","Keita Yoshioka1, Francesco Parisio1, Dmitri Naumov1, Renchao Lu1,2, Olaf Kolditz1,2 & …Thomas Nagel

2710,A nonstandard finite difference numerical scheme applied to a mathematical model of the prevalence of smoking in Spain: a case study,"In the present work, we develop a nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme to numerically solve a mathematical model for smoking habit dynamics. The model is described by a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, the solution of which predicts the evolution of the prevalence of smoking in Spain. This model has been successfully used to quantify the impact of the Spanish smoke-free law of 2006. According to the principles of dynamic consistency, we constructed an NSFD scheme to integrate numerically the smoking model. This NSFD scheme preserves the properties of the solution corresponding to the original continuous mathematical model such as positivity, local stability of equilibrium points and the associated conservation law. We performed some numerical comparisons with Euler, trapezoidal and fourth-order Runge–Kutta methods to test the NSFD scheme and corroborate that it is dynamically consistent. It is concluded that the NSFD scheme is well suited to numerically solve the mathematical model for smoking habit dynamics.","Francisco Guerrero1, Gilberto González-Parra2 & Abraham J.

The second method, and of primary interest, is the periodic counterpart of a novel discretization of a two-component Camassa–Holm system based on variational principles in Lagrangian variables. Applying explicit ODE solvers to integrate in time, we compare the variational discretizations to existing methods over several numerical examples.

Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is widely known to provide suitable energy saving potentials. However, the customarily utilized DVFS mechanism of the Linux kernel determines clock frequencies solely based on an idle time analysis. In contrast to this, we use an empirical approach based on preparatory measurements of the energy consumption at all available frequencies. From the resulting data we deduce energy-optimal frequencies, which are used in subsequent production runs. The described methodology can be deployed with routine granularity to account for varying code characteristics. For evaluation purposes, the approach is applied to the UG4 numerical simulation software.

It consists in determining the fluid velocity and the flux over a part of the boundary, by introducing given measurements on the remaining part. As it’s known, it is one of highly ill-posed problems in the Hadamard’s sense (Phys Today 6:18, 1953), it is then an interesting challenge to carry out a numerical procedure for approximating their solutions, in particular, in the presence of noisy data. To solve this problem, we propose here a regularizing approach based on a Tikhonov regularization method. We show the existence of the regularization optimization problem and prove the convergence of subsequence of optimal solutions of Tikhonov regularization formulations to the solution of the Cauchy problem, when the noise level goes to zero. Then, we suggest the numerical approximation of this problem using the finite elements method of \(P_{1Bubble}/P_1\) type’s, we show the existence of the discrete optimal regularized solution without noise and prove the convergence of subsequence of discrete optimal solutions to the solution of the continuous optimization problem.

The discrete equations inherit some properties of the original differential equations, in particular, the neutrality of the convective terms and the pressure gradient in the kinetic energy production. The method was applied to the direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows between two eccentric cylinders. Numerical computations were performed at Re = 4000 (where the Reynolds number Re was defined in terms of the mean velocity and the hydraulic diameter). It was found that two types of flow develop depending on the geometric parameters. In the flow of one type, turbulent fluctuations were observed over the entire cross section of the pipe, including the narrowest gap, where the local Reynolds number was only about 500. The flow of the other type was divided into turbulent and laminar regions (in the wide and narrow parts of the gap, respectively).",N. V.

The results show that the SV low-speed streaks are self-sustained at the early stage, and then transform into subharmonic sinuous (SS) low-speed streaks. Initially, the streamwise vortex sheets are formed by shearing, and then evolve into zigzag vortex sheets due to the mutual induction. As the intensification of the SV low-speed streaks becomes prominent, the tilted streamwise vortex tubes and the V-like streamwise vortex tubes can be formed simultaneously by increasing \( + \frac{{\partial u}} {{\partial x}}\). When the SV low-speed streaks break down, new zigzag streamwise vortices will be generated, thus giving birth to the next sustaining cycle of the SV low-speed streaks. When the second breakdown happens, new secondary V-like streamwise vortices instead of zigzag streamwise vortices will be generated. Because of the sweep motion of the fluid induced by the secondary V-like streamwise vortices, each decayed low-speed streak can be divided into two parts, and each part combines with the part of another streak, finally leading to the formation of SS low-speed streaks.","Jian Li1, Gang Dong1 & Jianlei Zhang",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-016-2038-6,"low-speed streak,subharmonic varicose mode,turbulent boundary layer,direct numerical simulation"

2734,A nonlinear magnetoelastic tube under extension and inflation in an axial magnetic field: numerical solution,"In the context of nonlinear magnetoelasticity theory very few boundary-value problems have been solved. The main problem that arises when a magnetic field is present, as compared with the purely elastic situation, is the difficulty of meeting the magnetic boundary conditions for bodies with finite geometry. In general, the extent of the edge effects is unknown a priori, and this makes it difficult to interpret experimental results in relation to the theory. However, it is important to make the connection between theory and experiment in order to develop forms of the magnetoelastic constitutive law that are capable of correlating with the data and can be used for making quantitative predictions. In this paper the basic problem of a circular cylindrical tube of finite length that is deformed by a combination of axial compression (or extension) and radial expansion (or contraction) and then subjected to an axial magnetic field is examined. Such a field cannot be uniform throughout, since the boundary conditions on the ends and the lateral surfaces of the tube would be incompatible in such circumstances. The resulting axisymmetric boundary-value problem is formulated and then solved numerically for the case (for simplicity of illustration) in which the deformation is not altered by the application of the magnetic field. The distribution of the magnetic-field components throughout the body and the surrounding space is determined in order to quantify the extent of the edge effects for both extension and compression of the tube.","R.

The diffusion tensor in the former problem depends on the scale of the pollution cloud, and the diffusivity in the latter problem depends nonlinearly on the desired function. For pollution dispersion by a turbulent flow, a stochastic discrete particle algorithm is constructed in the case when the diffusion tensor corresponds to the Richardson 4/3 law. The numerical and analytical results are shown to agree well. The problem of oil film spreading is described by a quasilinear advection-diffusion equation. For this problem, a random walking algorithm is constructed in which the variance of the walking particle step depends on the desired function. For both instantaneous and time-continuous sources of pollutants, the solution produced by the stochastic discrete particle method agrees well with the analytical and/or numerical solutions to the test problems under consideration.","B.

We consider, in particular, a class of models in which jumps are driven by marked point processes with intensities that depend on the LIBOR rates themselves. While this formulation offers some attractive modeling features, it presents a challenge for computational work. As a first step, we therefore show how to reformulate a term structure model driven by marked point processes with suitably bounded state-dependent intensities into one driven by a Poisson random measure. This facilitates the development of discretization schemes because the Poisson random measure can be simulated without discretization error. Jumps in LIBOR rates are then thinned from the Poisson random measure using state-dependent thinning probabilities. Because of discontinuities inherent to the thinning process, this procedure falls outside the scope of existing convergence results; we provide some theoretical support for our method through a result establishing first and second order convergence of schemes that accommodates thinning but imposes stronger conditions on other problem data. The bias and computational efficiency of various schemes are compared through numerical experiments.",Paul Glasserman1 & Nicolas Merener,Finance and Stochastics,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007800200076,"Key words: Interest rate models, Monte Carlo simulation, market models, marked point processes"

2752,"Preserving monotonicity in the numerical solution of Riccati differential equations
","Solutions of symmetric Riccati differential equations (RDEs for short) are in the usual applications positive semidefinite matrices.  Moreover, in the class of semidefinite matrices, solutions of different RDEs are also monotone, with respect to properly ordered data.  Positivity and monotonicity are essential properties of RDEs.  In Dieci and Eirola (1994), we showed that, generally, a direct discretization of the RDE cannot maintain positivity, and be of order greater than one. To get higher order, and to maintain positivity, we are thus forced to look into indirect solution procedures. Here, we consider the problem of how to maintain monotonicity in the numerical solutions of RDEs. Naturally, to obtain order greater than one, we are again forced to look into indirect solution procedures. Still, the restrictions imposed by monotonicity are more stringent that those of positivity, and not all of the successful indirect solution procedures of Dieci and Eirola (1994) maintain monotonicity.  We prove that by using symplectic Runge-Kutta (RK) schemes with positive weights (e.g., Gauss schemes) on the underlying Hamiltonian matrix, we eventually maintain monotonicity in the computed solutions of RDEs.

2756,Simplification of Numerical and Analytical Tools for Sonic Boom Description,"AbstractNumerical and analytical tools for aircraft sonic boom description are discussed in the light of the state of the art and development trends in methods for mathematical simulation of sonic booms. It is noted that an increasing role is played by numerical methods with mesh adaptation as applied to the steady Euler equations (in an aircraft-fixed frame in cruising flight) at distances from several to two ten body lengths. Another important tendency is that the complicated numerical–analytical approach to the mid- and far-field sonic boom description developed from the mid-20th century has been replaced by simpler approaches, including ones without using the Whitham function. As a development of these tendencies, we demonstrate that wave structures typical of sonic booms can be numerically computed using the Euler equations without constraints on distances and on the shock wave intensities, including extremely small ones. The description of the sonic boom evolution at distances of 15–20 body lengths to the ground is reduced to nearly immediate solution of Cauchy problems for ordinary differential equations that are consequences of the axisymmetric Euler equations. The viscous smearing of weak shock waves is described by the well-known one-dimensional stationary solution of the Navier–Stokes equations.","Kh. F. Valiyev1, A. N. Kraiko1 & N. I.

2759,A parallelized eno procedure for direct numerical simulation of compressible turbulence,"In this paper, a finite-difference based ENO (essentially nonoscillatory) procedure has been chosen for the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of compressible turbulence. The implementation of the ENO scheme follows the relatively efficient procedure in Shuet al. (1992), but the latter has been modified in the present paper to admit scalar conservation equations and to run on the iPSC/860 Paragon parallel supercomputer. DNS results with our procedure are in excellent agreement with pseudo-spectral and Padé approximation calculations in two and three dimensions. This is the case for a variety of initial conditions for compressible turbulence. The parallel algorithms presented are simple but quite efficient for DNS, with a speedup that approaches the theoretical value. Some of the attractive features include 1) minimum communication whereby a processor only communicates with two neighbors, 2) almost one hundred percent load balancing, 3) a checker-board approach to solve the Poisson equation reduces communication by a factor of approximately 2, and, 4) obtaining turbulence statistics is based on a ‘global collect’ approach, which is implemented to ensure that a single number, rather than a large matrix of numbers, is communicated between processors. The ENO code presented in this paper should be quite useful in its own right, while the parallel implementation should allow the simulation of fairly realistic problems.","F. Ladeinde1, E. E.

This research implements a set of large eddy simulations (LES) on the flow field in the downstream of the micro vortex generator (MVG) in supersonic flows with different Mach numbers. In this study, the downstream flow field affected by MVG at different Mach numbers was analyzed in detail, especially the large vortex structure generated in the upper boundary layer that plays a very important role in shock boundary layer interaction (SBLI). Studies have found that the incoming Mach number does not have a major impact on the generation mechanism of ring-like vortices, but it will affect the strength and length of the momentum deficit behind the MVG, thereby affecting the position of the vortex structure relative to the boundary layer and its intensity. At a high Mach number, the momentum deficit is located closer to the lower boundary layer so that the resulting upper vortex structure has more opportunity to interact with the structure in the lower boundary layer. This makes the upper vortex structure more distorted. Moreover, the power spectrum analysis of the frequency of ring-like vortices generated at different Mach numbers was also conducted in this research.","Yonghua Yan1, Yong Yang

Similar boundary value problems arise in computational neuroscience in determination of the behavior of a neuron to random synaptic inputs. When the shift parameters are smaller than the perturbation parameter, the shifted terms are expanded in Taylor series and an exponentially fitted tridiagonal finite difference scheme is developed. The proposed finite difference scheme is unconditionally stable and is convergent with order \(O(\Delta t+h^{2})\) where \(\Delta t\) and h respectively the time and space step-sizes. When the shift parameters are larger than the perturbation parameter a special type of mesh is used for the space variable so that the shifts lie on the nodal points and an exponentially fitted scheme is developed. This scheme is also unconditionally stable. By means of two examples, it is shown that the proposed methods provide uniformly convergent solutions with respect to the perturbation parameter.

2771,Direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows with chemical reaction,"Results from full turbulence simulations incorporating the effects of chemical reaction are compared with simple closure theories and used to reveal some physical insights about turbulent reacting flows. Pseudospectral methods for homogeneous turbulent flows with constant physical and thermal properties in domains as large as 643 Fourier modes were used for these simulations. For the case of nonpremixed flows involving a two-species, second-order, irreversible chemical reaction, it is found that the scalar dissipation microscale is only a weak function of the reaction rate and that chemical reaction contributes very little to the decay of the variance of the reactant concentration. Examination of local values of the velocity and concentration fields shows that the local reaction rate is highest in regions of the greatest rates of strain and that vorticity tends to align with the reaction zone. Finally, difficulties associated with the evaluation of multipoint pdf's and with the archival of time-dependent data from the threedimensional simulations are described.",Andy D. Leonard1 & James C.

2772,Approximate Homogenization of Fully Nonlinear Elliptic PDEs: Estimates and Numerical Results for Pucci Type Equations,"We are interested in the shape of the homogenized operator \(\overline{F}(Q)\) for PDEs which have the structure of a nonlinear Pucci operator. A typical operator is \(H^{a_1,a_2}(Q,x) = a_1(x) \lambda _{\min }(Q) + a_2(x)\lambda _{\max }(Q)\). Linearization of the operator leads to a non-divergence form homogenization problem, which can be solved by averaging against the invariant measure. We estimate the error obtained by linearization based on semi-concavity estimates on the nonlinear operator. These estimates show that away from high curvature regions, the linearization can be accurate. Numerical results show that for many values of Q, the linearization is highly accurate, and that even near corners, the error can be small (a few percent) even for relatively wide ranges of the coefficients.",Chris Finlay1 & Adam M.

Our approach transforms the nonlinear differential equation into a nonlinear algebraic system. We analyzed various forms of the fractional Bratu equation with different parameters of the equation and its fractional derivative orders. Besides, we show that the introduced method is convergent. We present the obtained results in tables and graphs. Based on these results, we can see the accuracy and convergence of the solutions.

2774,Tension-Compression and Shear of Plane Test Specimens from Laminated Composites with \(\boldsymbol{[90^{\circ}]}_{\boldsymbol{s}}\) Structure: Numerical Method of Linearized Problem and Multiscale Buckling Modes,"AbstractAs a development of the previously obtained results, a refined statement of linearized problems on the plane shear buckling modes of specimens made of fiber reinforced plastic with \([90^{\circ}]_{s}\) lay-up under tension-compression with shear is given. Micro- and mesoscale buckling modes of their structural elements in the form of fibers and bundles of fibers in a prebuckling state under shear and tension (compression) stresses in the direction across the fibers were considered. To formulate the problems, there are used the equations that were constructed earlier by reducing a consistent version of the geometrically nonlinear equations of the theory of elasticity to the one-dimensional equations of the theory of laminated straight beams with a layered structure through the thickness. It is based on the use of S.P. Timoshenko shear model taking into account tensile-compression transverse strain for each lamina. It is shown that a macroscale buckling in a purely shear mode is possible only under compression, and continuous rearrangement of the composite structure due to the implementation and continuous change of micro- and mesoscale internal buckling modes with a continuous change in wave formation parameters is also possible under other types of loading (compression, tension-compression with shear, pure shear). This, in particular, can explain the previously revealed decrease in the averaged shear modulus of the fiber reinforced plastic with an increase in shear strains.","V. N. Paimushin1,2, S. A.

2786,Numerical Method for Solving the Time-Fractional Dual-Phase-Lagging Heat Conduction Equation with the Temperature-Jump Boundary Condition,"This article proposes a new nanoscale heat transfer model based on the Caputo type fractional dual-phase-lagging (DPL) heat conduction equation with the temperature-jump boundary condition. The model is proved to be well-posed. A finite difference scheme based on the L1 approximation for the Caputo derivative is then presented for solving the fractional DPL model. Unconditional stability and convergence of the scheme are proved by using the discrete energy method. Three numerical examples are given to verify the accuracy of the scheme. Results show the convergence order to be \(O(\tau ^{2-\alpha }+h^2)\) , which coincides with the theoretical analysis. A simple nanoscale semiconductor silicon device is illustrated to show the applicability of the model. It is seen from the numerical result that when \(\alpha =1\), the fractional DPL reduces to the conventional DPL and the obtained peak temperature is almost identical to those obtained in the literature. However, when \(\alpha <1\), the model predicts a higher peak temperature level than that when \(\alpha =1\). In particular, when \(\alpha = 0.7\) and 0.9, an oscillatory temperature at the beginning is observed. This indicates that the fractional DPL model can be an excellent candidate for analyzing the temperature instability appearing in electronic nano-semiconductor devices.","Cui-cui Ji1, Weizhong Dai2,3 & Zhi-zhong Sun",Journal of Scientific Computing,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-017-0588-3,"Nanoscale heat transfer,Fractional DPL model,Temperature-jump boundary condition,Finite difference scheme,Stability,Convergence"

We use a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) framework to describe the dispersal of predators and prey in a heterogeneous landscape made of high quality and low quality habitat patches, subject to increasing fragmentation through habitat separation and/or habitat loss. Our results show that habitat fragmentation decreases the amplitude of the predator–prey population cycles while average population density is not as strongly affected in general. Beyond these simple trends however, the four models show differing responses to fragmentation, indicating that when making predictions about population survival and persistence in the face of habitat fragmentation, the choice of model is important.

In this paper, we give a general result that the asymptotic order of the minimal worst-case integration error is not affected by boundary conditions in the above mentioned spaces. In fact, we propose two tailored modifications of Frolov’s cubature formulae suitable for functions supported on the cube (not in the cube) that yield the same order of convergence up to a constant. This constant involves the norms of a “change of variable” and a “pointwise multiplication” mapping, respectively, between the function spaces of interest. We complement, extend, and improve classical results on the boundedness of change of variable mappings in Besov–Sobolev spaces of mixed smoothness. The second modification, suitable for classes of periodic functions, is based on a pointwise multiplication and is therefore most likely more suitable for applications than the (traditional) “change of variable” approach. These new theoretical insights are expected to be useful for the design of new (and robust) cubature rules for multivariate functions on the cube.","Van Kien Nguyen1,2, Mario Ullrich3 & Tino Ullrich",Constructive Approximation,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00365-017-9371-9,"Numerical integration,Change of variable,Periodization,Besov–Triebel–Lizorkin spaces,Dominating mixed smoothness"

For the temporal direction, the Crank-Nicholson scheme is used on the uniform mesh and to handle the spatial derivative term, the upwind scheme on both Shishkin mesh and Bakhvalov-Shishkin mesh is used. To validate the theoretical findings and to show the efficacy of the proposed scheme, two different kinds of examples are provided.

2793,DIMSEMs - diagonally implicit single-eigenvalue methods for the numerical solution of stiff ODEs on parallel computers,"This paper derives a new class of general linear methods (GLMs) intended for the solution of stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) on parallel computers. Although GLMs were introduced by Butcher in the 1960s, the task of deriving formulas from the class with properties suitable for specific applications is far from complete. This paper is a contribution to that work. Our new methods have several properties suited for the solution of stiff ODEs on parallel computers. They are strictly diagonally implicit, allowing parallelism in the Newton iteration used to solve the nonlinear equations arising from the implicitness of the formula. The stability matrix has no spurious eigenvalues (that is, only one eigenvalue of the stability matrix is non-zero), resulting in a solution free from contamination from spurious solutions corresponding to non-dominant, non-zero eigenvalues. From these two properties arises the name DIMSEM, for Diagonally IMplicit Single-Eigenvalue Method. The methods have high stage order, avoiding the phenomenon of order reduction that occurs, for example, with some Runge-Kutta methods. The methods are L-stable, with the result that the chosen stepsize is dictated by convergence requirements rather than stability considerations imposed by the stiffness of the problem. An introduction to GLMs is given and some order barriers for DIMSEMs are presented. DIMSEMs of orders 2-6 are derived, as well as an L-stable class of diagonal methods of all orders which do not, however, possess the single-eigenvalue property. A fixed-order, variable-stepsize implementation of the DIMSEMs is described, including the derivation of local error estimators, and the results of testing on both sequential and parallel computers is presented. The testing shows the DIMSEMs to be competitive with fixed-order versions of the popular solver LSODE on a practical test problem.",Robert F. Enenkel & Kenneth R.

In each equation the diffusion term is multiplied by a small parameter. The parameters can be of different magnitude due to which the problem exhibits overlapping layers. To approximate the solution of the problem, we consider two splitting schemes on uniform meshes for time discretization and the central difference scheme on Shishkin and generalised Shishkin meshes for space discretization. We prove that the proposed numerical method is uniformly convergent having convergence of order one in time and almost two in space. The splitting schemes are considered for the first time for coupled systems of singularly perturbed parabolic delay problems. They decouple the components of the approximate solution at each time level, and hence resulted in a reduced computational time. Further, we present numerical results for two test problems in support of our theoretical findings and to demonstrate that the splitting schemes are more efficient than the classical scheme."," Aakansha1, Sunil Kumar1 & Joginder Singh",Computational and Applied Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-021-01733-x,"Reaction–diffusion systems,Delay differential equations,Splitting schemes,Parabolic problems"

The model comprises bones, cartilage and the major ligaments, while patella and menisci are still missing. Bones are modeled by linear elastic materials, cartilage by linear viscoelastic materials, and ligaments by one-dimensional nonlinear Cosserat rods. In order to capture the dynamical contact problems correctly, we solve the full PDEs of elasticity with strict contact inequalities. The spatio-temporal discretization follows a time layers approach (first time, then space discretization). For the time discretization of the elastic and viscoelastic parts we use a new contact-stabilized Newmark method, while for the Cosserat rods we choose an energy-momentum method. For the space discretization, we use linear finite elements for the elastic and viscoelastic parts and novel geodesic finite elements for the Cosserat rods.

2802,Computational and Numerical Investigation of the Batch Markovian Arrival Process Subject to Renewal Generated Geometric Catastrophes,"In this paper, we consider a stochastic model in which the population grows according to the batch Markovian arrival process and is subjected to renewal generated geometric catastrophes. Our analytical work starts from the vector generating function (VGF) of the population size at post-catastrophe epoch. We develop a methodology for extracting the population size distribution at post-catastrophe epoch from the VGF, which is based on the inversion of VGF using the roots method. The method is analytically quite simple and easy to implement. Further, we obtain the population size distribution at arbitrary, pre-catastrophe and pre-arrival epochs along with their factorial moments. To show the applicability and correctness of the proposed methodology, we match our results with the available ones in special cases and present several numerical examples for different inter-catastrophe time distributions. Moreover, we investigate the effect of key parameters on the system performance and display the results in the form of graphs along with a detailed description.","Nitin Kumar1, Umesh Chandra Gupta1 & Gagandeep Singh2,",International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40819-021-01112-4,"Batch Markovian arrival process,Geometric catastrophes,Population,Renewal process,Roots"
2803,Arbitrary high order A-stable and B-convergent numerical methods for ODEs via deferred correction,"This paper presents a sequence of deferred correction (DC) schemes built recursively from the implicit midpoint scheme for the numerical solution of general first order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It is proven that each scheme is A-stable, satisfies a B-convergence property, and that the correction on a scheme DC2j of order 2j of accuracy leads to a scheme DC2j + 2 of order 2j + 2. The order of accuracy is guaranteed by a deferred correction condition. Numerical experiments with standard stiff and non-stiff ODEs are performed with the DC2, ..., DC10 schemes. The results show a high accuracy of the method. The theoretical orders of accuracy are achieved together with a satisfactory stability.","Saint-Cyr E. R. Koyaguerebo-Imé1 & Yves Bourgault

As prototypes for the application of our theory we consider benchmark multi-scale eigenvalue problems in reservoir modeling and material science. We compute a low-dimensional generalized (possibly mesh free) finite element space that preserves the lowermost eigenvalues in a superconvergent way. The approximate eigenpairs are then obtained by solving the corresponding low-dimensional algebraic eigenvalue problem.

Under the temporal–spatial condition to ensure the \(\hbox {L}^2\)-norm stability, the convergence orders in both space and time are optimal outside the pollution region due to the discontinuous initial data, whose width is nearly optimal to be one-half order of the mesh size, no matter in the upwind or the downwind direction. The kernel analysis is achieving the weighted \(\hbox {L}^2\)-norm stability result for the RKDG methods, based on the matrix transferring process and the local \(\hbox {L}^2\)-projection. Furthermore, we need to set up the weighted approximation property for the generalized Gauss–Radau projection. Finally some numerical experiments are also given to support the theoretical results.","Yuan Xu1, Di Zhao2 & Qiang Zhang

On the numerical level, this allows us to avoid the tedious computations of the method based on vector fields. A gradient method combined with a boundary element method is performed for the approximation of this problem, in order to overcome the re-meshing task required by the finite element method.

2807,Building Up an Illiquid Stock Position Subject to Expected Fund Availability: Optimal Controls and Numerical Methods,"This paper is concerned with modeling, analysis, and numerical methods for stochastic optimal control of an illiquid stock position build-up. The stock price model is based on a geometric Brownian motion formulation, in which the drift is allowed to be purchase-rate dependent to capture the “price impact” of heavy share accumulation over time. The expected fund (or capital) availability has an upper bound. A Lagrange multiplier method is used to treat the constrained control problem. The stochastic control problem is analyzed and a verification theorem is developed. Although optimality is proved, a closed-form solution is virtually impossible to obtain. As a viable alternative, approximation schemes are developed, which consist of inner and outer approximations. The inner approximation is a numerical procedure for obtaining optimal strategies based on a fixed parameter of the Lagrange multiplier. The outer approximation is a stochastic approximation algorithm for obtaining the optimal Lagrange multiplier. Convergence analysis is provided for both the inner and outer approximations. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate our results.","Xianggang Lu1, George Yin2, Qing Zhang3, Caojin Zhang2 & …Xianping Guo",Applied Mathematics & Optimization,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00245-016-9359-z,"Constrained stochastic control,Lagrange multiplier ,Numerical method"

The flux-limiting criterion for continuity equations is derived using the proposed partial monotony property of a finite difference scheme. For two-dimensional extension, the cone transport upwind approach for constructing genuinely two-dimensional difference schemes is used. It is shown that when calculating rotations of symmetric profiles by using this scheme, a circular form of isolines is not distorted in a distinct from the coordinate splitting method. The conservative second order finite-difference scheme is proposed for solving the equations system of the drift-diffusion model of electric discharge; this scheme implies finite-difference conservation laws of electric charge and full electric current (fully conservative scheme).

2810,A numerical treatment of the periodic solutions of non-linear vibration systems,"Direct numerical integration can be used to find the periodic solutions for the equations of motion of nonlinear vibration systems. The initial conditions are iterated so that they coincide with the terminal conditions. The time interval of the integration (i.e., the period) and certain parameters of the equations of motion can be included in the iterations. The integration method has a variable steplength.This shooting method can produce periodic solutions with a shorter computer time. The only error occurs in the numerical integration and it can therefore be estimated and made small enough. Using this method one can treat a variety of vibration problems, such as free conservative, forced, parameter-excited and self-sustained vibrations with one or several degrees-of-freedom. Unstable solutions and those which are sensitive to parameter changes can also be calculated. The stability of the solutions is investigated based on the theory of differential equations with periodic coefficients. The extrapolation method and the procedure of automatic steplength control are used to estimate the initial values of iterations by determining the resonance curve and other vibration characteristics.Some examples have been calculated to illustrate the applicability of the method. The non-linearity may be expressed by an analytical function or any other functions, such as a piecewise linear function. Several remarkable features of nonlinear vibrations are presented through the periodic solutions obtained.

Multi-symplectic discretisations based on these new formulations of the problems are exemplified by means of the explicit Euler box scheme, and Hamiltonian-preserving discretisations are exemplified by means of the discrete variational derivative method. We explain and justify the correct treatment of boundary conditions in a unified manner.

Pass 1 builds a combinatorial structure on the rows ofA which hierarchically decomposes them into blocks. This determines the structure of the optimal transformation matrixT. In Pass 2, we use the information aboutT as a road map to do block-wise partial Gauss-Jordan elimination onA. Two block-aggregation strategies are also suggested that could further reduce the time spend in Pass 2.

2816,"On the row merge tree for sparse LU factorization with partial pivoting
              
              
            ","We consider the problem of structure prediction for sparse LU factorization with partial pivoting. In this context, it is well known that the column elimination tree plays an important role for matrices satisfying an irreducibility condition, called the strong Hall property.Our primary goal in this paper is to address the structure prediction problem for matrices satisfying a weaker assumption, which is the Hall property. For this we consider the row merge matrix, an upper bound that contains the nonzeros in L and U for all possible row permutations that can be performed during the numerical factorization with partial pivoting. We discuss the row merge tree, a structure that represents information obtained from the row merge matrix; that is, information on the dependencies among the columns in Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting and on structural upper bounds of the factors L and U.We present new theoretical results that show that the nonzero structure of the row merge matrix can be described in terms of branches and subtrees of the row merge tree. These results lead to an efficient algorithm for the computation of the row merge tree, that uses as input the structure of A, and has a time complexity almost linear in the number of nonzeros in A. We also investigate experimentally the usage of the row merge tree for structure prediction purposes on a set of matrices that satisfy only the Hall property. We analyze in particular the size of upper bounds of the structure of L and U, the reordering of the matrix based on a postorder traversal and its impact on the factorization runtime. We show experimentally that for some matrices, the row merge tree is a preferred alternative to the column elimination tree. ","L. Grigori1, M. Cosnard2 & E.G.

2818,A Class of Lagrangian–Eulerian Shock-Capturing Schemes for First-Order Hyperbolic Problems with Forcing Terms,"In this work, we develop an improved shock-capturing and high-resolution Lagrangian–Eulerian method for hyperbolic systems and balance laws. This is a new method to deal with discontinuous flux and complicated source terms having concentrations for a wide range of applications science and engineering, namely, 1D shallow-water equations, sedimentation processes, Geophysical flows in 2D, N-Wave models, and Riccati-type problems with forcing terms. We also include numerical simulations of a 1D two-phase flow model in porous media, with gravity and a nontrivial singular \(\delta \)-source term representing an injection point. Moreover, we present approximate solutions for 2D nonlinear systems (Compressible Euler Flows and Shallow-Water Equations) for distinct benchmark configurations available in the literature aiming to present convincing and robust numerical results. In addition, for the linear advection model in 1D and for a smooth solution of the nonlinear Burgers’ problem, second order approximations were obtained. We also present a high-resolution approximation of the nonlinear non-convex Buckley–Leverett problem. Based on the work of A. Harten, we derive a convergent Lagrangian–Eulerian scheme that is total variation diminishing and second-order accurate, away from local extrema and discontinuous data. Additionally, using a suitable Kružkov’s entropy definition, introduced by K. H. Karlsen and J. D. Towers, we can verify that our improved Lagrangian–Eulerian scheme converges to the unique entropy solution for conservation laws with a discontinuous space-time dependent flux. A key hallmark of our method is the dynamic tracking forward of the no-flow curves, which are locally conservative and preserve the natural setting of weak entropic solutions related to hyperbolic problems that are not reversible systems in general. In the end, we have a general procedure to construct a class of Lagrangian–Eulerian schemes to deal with hyperbolic problems with or without forcing terms. The proposed scheme is free of Riemann problem solutions and no adaptive space-time discretizations are needed. The numerical experiments verify the efficiency and accuracy of our new Lagrangian–Eulerian method.","E. Abreu

Namely, a formulation is proposed which involves an artificial dissipation parameter and guarantees a consistency property between the continuity equation and the transport equation at the discrete level and, in addition, ensures the nonlinear stability and positivity of the scheme. A well-balanced positivity-preserving reconstruction is stated in terms of the conservative variable describing the concentration. We establish that constant-concentration states are preserved in space and time for any hydrodynamic flow field in the absence of source terms in the transport equation. Furthermore, we prove the maximum and minimum principles for the concentration. A suitable discretization of the diffusion term is used in combination with the proposed reconstruction procedure and artificial dissipation formulation and this allows us to prove the positivity of the concentration in the presence of diffusion effects. Finally, our numerical experiments confirm the well-balanced and positivity-preserving properties when the artificial dissipation is introduced in the central-upwind scheme, and the accuracy of the scheme for modeling surface water flows with transport processes.","Hasan Karjoun1, Abdelaziz Beljadid

2831,Characteristic Based Volume Penalization Method for Numerical Simulation of Compressible Flows on Unstructured Meshes,"AbstractA characteristic based volume penalization method for numerical simulation of viscous compressible gas flows near solid bodies with immersed boundaries is presented. In contrast to other immersed boundary methods based on penalty functions, characteristic penalty functions ensure the correct formulation of the Neumann condition and, specifically, the adiabatic condition on the body surface. A numerical algorithm based on the method is described in detail. The algorithm combines the finite-volume approach based on high-order accurate EBR schemes in the outer flow region and first-order finite-difference schemes within the body. The developed algorithm can be used on meshes of arbitrary structure, including fully unstructured ones. The efficiency of the characteristic based volume penalization method and its implementation is demonstrated as applied to benchmark problems, such as the reflection of a shock wave and an acoustic pulse from a solid wall and the Couette flow. The solutions of the same problems produced by the well-known Brinkman penalization method are given for comparison.","I. V. Abalakin1, O. V. Vasilyev1, N. S. Zhdanova1 & …T. K.

2832,Numerical simulation of surface acoustic wave actuated cell sorting,"We consider the mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of high throughput sorting of two different types of biological cells (type I and type II) by a biomedical micro-electro-mechanical system (BioMEMS) whose operating behavior relies on surface acoustic wave (SAW) manipulated fluid flow in a microchannel. The BioMEMS consists of a separation channel with three inflow channels for injection of the carrier fluid and the cells, two outflow channels for separation, and an interdigital transducer (IDT) close to the lateral wall of the separation channel for generation of the SAWs. The cells can be distinguished by fluorescence. The inflow velocities are tuned so that without SAW actuation a cell of type I leaves the device through a designated outflow channel. However, if a cell of type II is detected, the IDT is switched on and the SAWs modify the fluid flow so that the cell leaves the separation channel through the other outflow boundary. The motion of a cell in the carrier fluid is modeled by the Finite Element Immersed Boundary method (FE-IB). Numerical results are presented that illustrate the feasibility of the surface acoustic wave actuated cell sorting approach.","Thomas Franke1, Ronald H. W.

2833,Stochastic algorithm and numerical simulation for drop scavenging of aerosols,"The time evolution of aerosol size distribution during precipitation, which is founded mathematically by general dynamic equation (GDE) for wet removal, describes quantitatively the process of aerosol wet scavenging. The equation depends on aerosol size distribution, raindrop size distribution and the complicated model of scavenging co-efficient which is induced by taking account of the important wet removal mechanisms such as Brownian diffusion, interception and inertial impaction. Normal numerical methods can hardly solve GDE, which is a typical partially integro-differential equation. A new multi-Monte Carlo method was introduced to solve GDE for wet removal, and then was used to simulate the wet scavenging of aerosols in the real atmospheric environment. The results of numerical simulation show that, the smaller lognormal raindrop size distribution and lognormal initial aerosol size distribution, the smaller geometric mean diameter or geometric standard deviation of raindrops can help scavenge small aerosols and intermediate size aerosols better, though large aerosols are prevented from being collected in some ways.","Zhao Hai-bo Doctor

When the finite volume schemes are applied, the transversal variation relative to the computational cell interfaces is neglected, and only the normal numerical flux is used, thanks to the Gauss-Green formula. In order to offset such defects, the Lax-Wendroff flow solvers or the generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solvers are adopted by substituting the time evolution of flows into the spatial variation. The numerical results show that even with the same convergence rate, the error by the GRP2D solver is almost one ninth of that by the multistage Runge-Kutta (RK) method.","Xin Lei1 & Jiequan Li2,",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-019-2444-6,"transversal effect,generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver,Lax-Wendroff flow solver,wave system"

2850,On numerical modelling and the blow-up behavior of contact lines with a \(\mathbf{180}^{\varvec{\circ }}\) contact angle,"We study numerically a reduced model proposed by Benilov and Vynnycky [J Fluid Mech 718:481–506, 2013], who examined the behavior of a contact line with a \(180^{\circ }\) contact angle between liquid and a moving plate, in the context of a two-dimensional Couette flow. The model is given by a linear fourth-order advection–diffusion equation with an unknown velocity, which is to be determined dynamically from an additional boundary condition at the contact line. The main claim of Benilov and Vynnycky is that for any physically relevant initial condition, there is a finite positive time at which the velocity of the contact line tends to negative infinity, whereas the profile of the fluid flow remains regular. Additionally, it is claimed that the velocity behaves as the logarithmic function of time near the blow-up time. Compared to the previous computations based on COMSOL built-in algorithms, we use MATLAB and develop a direct finite-difference method to study dynamics of the reduced model under different initial conditions. We confirm the first claim and also show that the blow-up behavior is better approximated by a power function, compared with the logarithmic function. This numerical result suggests a simple analytical explanation of the blow-up behavior of contact lines.","Dmitry E.

We first introduce a new Lyapunov-candidate functional and show that its derivative along the solution trajectory is strictly negative. Moreover, we are able to show that this functional admits the optimal transport density as a unique minimizer, providing further support to the conjecture that our dynamic model is time-asymptotically equivalent to the Monge–Kantorovich equations governing \(L^{1}\) optimal transport. Remarkably, this newly proposed Lyapunov-candidate functional can be effectively used to calculate the Wasserstein-1 (or earth mover’s) distance between two measures. We numerically solve these equations via a simple approach based on standard forward Euler time stepping and linear Galerkin finite element. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed solver is verified on a number of test problems of mixed complexity also in comparison with other approaches proposed in the literature. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme is very efficient and accurate for the calculation the Wasserstein-1 distances.","Enrico Facca

Classical point symmetries are exhaustively discussed by Oberlack et al. (Combust Theor Model 5:363–383, 2001). Further, if the flow velocity is zero, an infinite series of higher-order symmetries has been derived by Oberlack (J Calcutta Math Soc 1:41–52, 2004). Presently it is evidenced that the G-equation also admits an infinite number of higher-order symmetries for an arbitrary velocity field. Higher-order symmetries involving derivatives up to second order are computed. Geometrical and kinematic interpretations of the symmetries are given. For the special case of constant flow velocity, an infinite set of local conservation laws of the G-equation has been derived using the direct method.

These kinds of problems present several analytical and numerical difficulties related, for example, to time evolution and a moving boundary. We present a numerical method that employs a global convergent nonlinear complementarity algorithm for solving a discretized problem at each time step. Space discretization was implemented using both the finite difference implicit scheme and the finite element method. This method is robust and efficient. Although the present method is general, at this stage we only apply it to two one-dimensional examples. One of them involves a parabolic partial differential equation that describes oxygen diffusion problem inside one cell. The second one corresponds to a system of nonlinear differential equations describing an in situ combustion model. Both models are rewritten in the quasi-variational form involving moving boundaries.

2867,Numerical simulation of blood and interstitial flow through a solid tumor,"A theoretical framework is presented for describing blood flow through the irregular vasculature of a solid tumor. The tumor capillary bed is modeled as a capillary tree of bifurcating segments whose geometrical construction involves deterministic and random parameters. Blood flow along the individual capillaries accounts for plasma leakage through the capillary walls due to the transmural pressure according to Sterling’s law. The extravasation flow into the interstitium is described by Darcy’s law for a biological porous medium. The pressure field developing in the interstitium is computed by solving Laplace’s equation subject to derived boundary conditions at the capillary vessel walls. Given the arterial, venous, and tumor surface pressures, the problem is formulated as a coupled system of integral and differential equations arising from the interstitium and capillary flow transport equations. Numerical discretization yields a system of linear algebraic equations for the interstitial and capillary segment pressures whose solution is found by iterative methods. Results of numerical computations document the effect of the interstitial hydraulic and vascular permeability on the fractional plasma leakage. Given the material properties, the fractional leakage reaches a maximum at a particular grade of the bifurcating vascular tree.",C.

Another approach is to recast the AVE as a system of nonsmooth equations and then tackle with the nonsmooth equations. In this paper, we follow this path. In particular, we rewrite it as a system of smooth equations and propose four new smoothing functions along with a smoothing-type algorithm to solve the system of equations.

We adopt the level set framework developed in (Jin et al. in J. Comput. Phys. 210:497–518, 2005) which allows one to compute the multivalued physical observables via solving the classical Liouville equation with bounded initial data and approximating delta function integrals. We achieve high order accuracy for our method by studying two issues. The first is to highly accurately compute the solution and its derivatives of the Liouville equation with bounded initial data and discontinuous potentials. The second is to design high order numerical methods to evaluate one-dimensional delta function integrals with discontinuous kernel functions.

The model equations are treated with the Newton-based spectral quasilinearization method to ascertain the effects of different parameters of interest such as volume fraction and the Prandtl number on the velocity, temperature, concentration and heat and mass transfer rates. This method has been shown in the literature to be robust and rapidly convergent. The validity of the results is checked by comparing numerical results, in the limiting case, with published results in the literature. The study showed that the rate of flow, heat and mass transfer appreciate with increased volume fraction of the nanoparticles. Increasing the Prandtl was found to decrease temperature but increase concentration. A rise in the Schmidt number resulted in decreased temperature but did not have any appreciable effect on the concentration. Additionally, a lower temperature was predicted from a rise in activation energy while concentration was predicted to appreciate as a result of increased activation energy. The study has applications in the removal of contaminants in the beverages and waste water recovery industries.","Mangwiro Magodora1, Hiranmoy Mondal2, Sandile Motsa3 & …Precious Sibanda",International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40819-022-01241-4,"Nanofluid,Binary chemical reaction,Activation energy,Quasilinearization,Rotating disk,Brownian motion,Chebyshev spectral collocation"
2871,Time Adaptive Numerical Solution of a Highly Degenerate Diffusion–Reaction Biofilm Model Based on Regularisation,We consider a quasilinear degenerate diffusion–reaction system that describes biofilm formation. The model exhibits two non-linear effects: a power law degeneracy as one of the dependent variables vanishes and a super diffusion singularity as it approaches unity. Biologically relevant solutions are characterized by a moving interface and gradient blow-up there. Discretisation of the PDE in space by a standard finite volume scheme leads to a singular system of ordinary differential equations. We show that regularisation of this system allows the application of error controlled adaptive integration techniques to solve the underlying PDE. This overcomes the major limitation of existing methods for this type of problem which work with fixed time-steps. We apply the resulting numerical method to study the effect of signal diffusion in the aqueous phase on quorum sensing induction in a biofilm colony.,"Maryam Ghasemi

The solution technique takes advantage of an infinite-dimensional linear programming formulation for the problem which relates the stationary measures to the generators of the diffusion. The restriction of the diffusion to an interval is accomplished through reflection at one end point and a jump operator acting singularly in time at the other end point.

The turbulent characteristics of the fluid are calculated using a modified model of transfer of components of the Reynolds stress tensor, taking into account the presence of the gaseous phase in the medium. For an approximate calculation of the heat transfer coefficient for bubble boiling of a liquid near the heat-generating wall, generalized empirical dependences are used, taking into account the various mechanisms of heat transfer in a two-phase vapor-liquid medium. Comparison of the results of numerical modeling with experimental data has shown that the proposed approach allows to simulate bubble boiling modes in a wide range of pressure values, mass flow rates, heating modes of subcooled liquids during forced turbulent fluid flow in vertical pipes.",D.

2887,Numerical Simulations of Waves Breaking over a Rectangular Submerged Reef Consisting of a Double Step: Analogies with massive Natural Wave Breaking over Abrupt Bathymetries,"The aim of this article is not to study any practical design for a breakwater device nor to show the evidence of a particular event when waves break over a varying bathymetry, but to promote a paper showing an interesting idea of wave decomposition prior to impact, used in an experimental and numerical study published by Yasuda et al. (Proceedings 25th international conferences coastal engineering, pp 300–313, 1996) and Yasuda et al. (Coast Eng J 41(2): 269–280, 1999. We investigated the new type of breaker, proposed by Yasuda et al. (1996), by detailing several geometric aspects which lead to the unusual size and behavior of some very large plunging jets generated when waves break above some drastic changes of bathymetry. We thoroughly investigated all geometrical aspects of the breaking process, to propose a classification of the breaker types which were observed in our numerical results. We indicated the influences of the reef parameters (steps heights and lengths) on the subsequent breaking process. We also showed that the air entrainment was indeed much larger during the composite breaker occurrence.","Florian Desmons1 & Pierre Lubin

2888,The numerical algorithms of infinite integrals involving products of Bessel functions of arbitrary order,"The integrals of arbitrary products of zero-order and first-order Bessel functions (double Bessel functions) are widely used in practical problems. However, due to the strong oscillation and slow decay properties of the product terms of the double Bessel function, traditional numerical integration algorithms are no longer applicable. It is particularly important to develop high-precision and high-efficiency numerical algorithms for these types of integrals. In this paper, using the large argument approximate expression of the Bessel function and the accumulation property of the integral, double Bessel function integrals are transformed into the algebraic sum of ordinary integral forms in finite region and Fourier transform forms. The folded linear approach method and the Gaver–Stehfest (G–S) inverse Laplace transform method are developed for double Bessel function integrals and double-order single-argument Hankel transforms. Numerical examples are given to verify the efficiency and precision of these methods. The results show that the precision of the folded linear approach method is higher than that of the G–S inverse Laplace transform method, while the latter is more efficient and runs several times faster than the former. These two methods have different requirements for \(F(\lambda )\) when using the double Bessel function integrals. Therefore, the method that should be selected depends on the requirements of the specific \(F(\lambda )\) problem. This paper presents reliable computing methods for the study of fracture mechanics, electromagnetic responses, acoustic wave scattering, and droplet wetting.","Yonglin Yang

We analyze the ill-posedness of the problem and construct a regularization algorithm. Using the Fourier series expansion with respect to one variable, we reduce the problem to a sequence of Dirichlet problems for one-dimensional wave equations. The first stage of regularization consists in selecting a finite number of problems from this sequence. Each of the selected Dirichlet problems is formulated as an inverse problem Aq = f with respect to a direct (well-posed) problem. We derive formulas for singular values of the operator A in the case of constant coefficients and analyze their behavior to judge the degree of ill-posedness of the corresponding problem. The problem Aq = f on a uniform grid is reduced to a system of linear algebraic equations A

Thickness is defined as the length of trajectories, also called streamlines, which follow the gradient of the solution of the Laplace equation solved between the inner and the outer surfaces of the tissue using Dirichlet conditions.We present a new numerical solution of the Laplace equation for 3D MRI. Our method is accurate and computationally fast. High accuracy is obtained by solving the Laplace equation for anisotropic 3D MRI.We present also an fast and accurate algorithm for calculation of the length of the streamlines. This algorithm is based on a 26 voxels neighbors method and consists of the summation of the Euclidean distance between different voxels neighbors on the same streamline.Our approach was tested on set of synthetic images and several medical applications including knee cartilage, cerebral cortex of a normal adult and cerebral cortex of a newborn. We compare the results with the Euclidean distance measured normal to one boundary along a path between the two boundaries. Numerical validation was performed on set of magnetic resonance images of the knee cartilage. It shows that the 3D PDE approach provides a better result than the Euclidean distance.","Haissam Haidar1, Svetlana Egorova2 & Janet S.

2893,IDENT: Identifying Differential Equations with Numerical Time Evolution,"Identifying unknown differential equations from a given set of discrete time dependent data is a challenging problem. A small amount of noise can make the recovery unstable. Nonlinearity and varying coefficients add complexity to the problem. We assume that the governing partial differential equation (PDE) is a linear combination of few differential terms in a prescribed dictionary, and the objective of this paper is to find the correct coefficients. We propose a new direction based on the fundamental convergence principle of numerical PDE schemes. We utilize Lasso for efficiency, and a performance guarantee is established based on an incoherence property. The main contribution is to validate and correct the results by time evolution error (TEE). A new algorithm, called identifying differential equations with numerical time evolution (IDENT), is explored for data with non-periodic boundary conditions, noisy data and PDEs with varying coefficients. Based on the recovery theory of Lasso, we propose a new definition of Noise-to-Signal ratio, which better represents the level of noise in the case of PDE identification. The effects of data generations and downsampling are systematically analyzed and tested. For noisy data, we propose an order preserving denoising method called least-squares moving average (LSMA), to preprocess the given data. For the identification of PDEs with varying coefficients, we propose to add Base Element Expansion (BEE) to aid the computation. Various numerical experiments from basic tests to noisy data, downsampling effects and varying coefficients are presented.","Sung Ha Kang1, Wenjing Liao1 & Yingjie Liu",Journal of Scientific Computing,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-020-01404-9,"Identifying unknown differential equations,Time evolution error (TEE),Varying coefficients,Base element expansion (BEE),Denoising,Downsampling"
2894,Numerical Solution of Orbital Combat Games Involving Missiles and Spacecraft,"This research addresses the problem of the optimal interception of an optimally evasive orbital target by a pursuing spacecraft or missile. The time for interception is to be minimized by the pursuing space vehicle and maximized by the evading target. This problem is modeled as a two-sided optimization problem, i.e. as a two-player zero-sum differential game. The work incorporates a recently developed method, termed “semi-direct collocation with nonlinear programming”, for the numerical solution of dynamic games. The method is based on the formal conversion of the two-sided optimization problem into a single-objective one, by employing the analytical necessary conditions for optimality related to one of the two players. An approximate, first attempt solution for the method is provided through the use of a genetic algorithm in a “preprocessing” phase. Three qualitatively different cases are considered. In the first example the pursuer and the evader are represented by two spacecraft orbiting the Earth in two distinct orbits. The second and the third case involve two missiles, and a missile that pursues an orbiting spacecraft, respectively. The numerical results achieved in this work testify to the robustness and effectiveness of the method also in solving large, complex, three-dimensional problems.",Mauro Pontani,Dynamic Games and Applications,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13235-011-0024-5,"Orbital dynamic games,Pursuit-evasion games,Two-sided optimization"

In particular, we report our numerical observations about the change of the monotonicity and the possible occurrence of multihump waves. The stability of the travelling wavefront is numerically considered by computing the full time-dependent partial differential equations with nonlocal delay.

2899,On the global asymptotic stability of a hepatitis B epidemic model and its solutions by nonstandard numerical schemes,"Very recently, a hepatitis B epidemic model with saturated incidence rate has been proposed and analyzed in Khan et al. (Chaos Solitons Fractals 124:1–9, 2019). The local asymptotic stability of the disease endemic equilibrium (DEE) point of model has been established theoretically but its global asymptotic stability has not been studied. In this paper, we present a mathematically rigorous analysis for the global asymptotic stability of the DEE point of the model. More precisely, we prove that if the DEE point exists, then it is not only locally asymptotically stable but also globally asymptotically stable. Furthermore, we present an alternative proof for the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium point. The main result is that we obtain the complete global stability of the hepatitis B virus model. Besides, we construct nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) schemes preserving the essential qualitative properties of the continuous model. These properties include the positivity of solutions and the stability of the model. Dynamical properties of the proposed schemes are rigorously investigated by mathematical analyses and numerical simulations. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to confirm the validity of the theoretical results as well as the advantages of the NSFD schemes. Numerical simulations also indicate that the NSFD schemes are appropriate and effective to solve the continuous model. Meanwhile, the standard finite difference schemes such as the Euler scheme, the classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta scheme cannot preserve the essential properties of the continuous model. Consequently, they can generate numerical approximations which are completely different from the solutions of the model.","Manh Tuan Hoang

A similar problem was previously considered in the steady case. Now the same problem is solved in the unsteady formulation. The numerical method is based on a generalization of the splitting method with respect to physical processes, which is widely used in rarefied gas dynamics. The basic difficulty faced in the natural generalization of this method as applied to thruster jets is that a boundary condition has to be taken into account when the ion distribution function is determined. This difficulty is overcome by analytically selecting the corresponding term at the stage of free-molecular motion. Another difficulty that can be coped with by the splitting method is that the ion and neutral velocity spaces have widely different scales. Techniques for making the method conservative are described, and situations in which this is necessary are discussed. Qualitative characteristics of some numerical computations are compared with experimental data. The comparison shows that the numerical method constructed adequately reproduces the behavior of the modeled object.",A. S. Arkhipov1 & A. M.

2912,Numerical Simulation of Unsteady Blood Flow through Capillary Networks,"A numerical method is implemented for computing unsteady blood flow through a branching capillary network. The evolution of the discharge hematocrit along each capillary segment is computed by integrating in time a one-dimensional convection equation using a finite-difference method. The convection velocity is determined by the local and instantaneous effective capillary blood viscosity, while the tube to discharge hematocrit ratio is deduced from available correlations. Boundary conditions for the discharge hematocrit at divergent bifurcations arise from the partitioning law proposed by Klitzman and Johnson involving a dimensionless exponent, q≥1. When q=1, the cells are partitioned in proportion to the flow rate; as q tends to infinity, the cells are channeled into the branch with the highest flow rate. Simulations are performed for a tree-like, perfectly symmetric or randomly perturbed capillary network with m generations. When the tree involves more than a few generations, a supercritical Hopf bifurcation occurs at a critical value of q, yielding spontaneous self-sustained oscillations in the absence of external forcing. A phase diagram in the m–q plane is presented to establish conditions for unsteady flow, and the effect of various geometrical and physical parameters is examined. For a given network tree order, m, oscillations can be induced for a sufficiently high value of q by increasing the apparent intrinsic viscosity, decreasing the ratio of the vessel diameter from one generation to the next, or by decreasing the diameter of the terminal vessels. With other parameters fixed, oscillations are inhibited by increasing m. The results of the continuum model are in excellent agreement with the predictions of a discrete model where the motion of individual cells is followed from inlet to outlet.",J. M. Davis1 & C.

2913,A Fuzzy Transform Method for Numerical Solution of Fractional Volterra Integral Equations,"Many researchers have used the numerical methods for the purpose of solving Volterra integral equations. In this research work, we have shown that it is possible to use fuzzy transform method (\( F\text {-transform} \)) to tackle with the fractional Volterra integral equation. The core idea of the technique of F-transforms is a fuzzy partition of a universe into fuzzy subsets. A function can be associated with a mapping from a set of fuzzy subsets to the set of its thus obtained average values. In numerical method, in order to approximate a function on a particular interval, only a restricted number of points have been employed. However, what makes the \( F\text {-transform} \) preferable to other methods is that it makes use of all points in this interval. Thus, a number of clear and specific examples have been enumerated for the purpose of illustrating the simplicity and the efficiency of the suggested method.",B. Agheli1 & M.

The one-way coupled particle tracking method (PTM) and the boundary element method (BEM) are adopted to simulate these two stages, respectively. Meanwhile, the initial condition of the second stage is taken as the output of the first one, and the entire simulation is connected and completed.

Rational Gegenbauer (RG) functions are used to find the better solution comparing to other current works. The drawback of nonlinearity is met using a linearization method, namely, the quasi-linearization method (QLM). As comping on a semi-infinite domain, an approximation is considered to satisfy the infinity condition using the algebraic mapping of \(\frac{\xi -L}{\xi +L}\), where L is a positive arbitrary numerical parameter and a suitable value is calculated for it. Using the QLM, the equation is converted into a sequence of linear ordinary differential equations (ODE); then, these ODEs are solved using the RG collocation method. Finally, the numerical results are presented and the proposed method is compared with the state-of-the-art methods.","Kourosh Parand1,2, Arman Bahramnezhad1 & Hadi Farahani",Computational and Applied Mathematics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-018-0679-2,"Powell–Eyring non-Newtonian fluid,Quasi-linearization method,Rational Gegenbauer functions,Collocation method,Stretching sheet"

We develop a second-order time marching scheme by adopting the recently developed stabilized-SAV (scalar auxiliary variable) approach where several critical stabilization terms are added to enhance the stability; thus, large time steps are allowed in computations. The scheme is highly efficient and one only needs to solve several decoupled linear equations with constant coefficients at each time step. The energy stability of the scheme is proved, and various 2D and 3D numerical experiments including the drop deformations and phase separations are then performed to validate the accuracy and energy stability of the proposed scheme.","Yubing Sui1, Jingzhou Jiang2, Guigen Jin3 & …Xiaofeng Yang",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-021-09865-8,"Phase-field,Nematic,Cahn-Hilliard,Unconditional energy stability,SSAV,Second-order"

We prove that such schemes also have the dynamical property that we call Random A-stability (RA-stability), which ensures that, for linear equations with stationary solutions, the numerical scheme has a random attractor that converges to the exact one as the step size decreases. Basically, the proposed integrators are obtained by splitting, at each time step, the solution of the original equation into two parts: the solution of a linear ordinary differential equation plus the solution of an auxiliary SDE. The first one is solved by the Local Linearization scheme in such a way that A-stability is guaranteed, while the second one is approximated by any extant scheme, preferably an explicit one that yields high order of convergence with low computational cost. Numerical integrators constructed in this way are called High Order Local Linearization (HOLL) methods. Various efficient HOLL schemes are elaborated in detail, and their performance is illustrated through computer simulations. Furthermore, mean-square convergence of the introduced methods is studied.","H. De la Cruz Cancino1, R. J. Biscay2, J. C. Jimenez2, F. Carbonell3 & …T.

We can hardly acquire the explicit solution for the SIVS model, so we often use the numerical scheme to produce approximate solutions. The Euler–Maruyama (EM) method is a useful and effective means in producing numerical solutions of SIVS model. The EM method to simulate the stochastic SIVS model often results in the problem that the numerical solution is not positive. In order to eliminate the negative path of the solution in a stochastic SIVS epidemic model, we construct a numerical method preserving positivity for the SIVS model.

2929,Joint k-numerical ranges of operators,"Let \(\mathcal{H} \) be a complex Hilbert space and \(\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}) \) the algebra of all
bounded linear operators on \( \mathcal{H} \). For a positive integer k less than the dimension
of \(\mathcal{H} \) and \({\bf A}=(A_1,...,AM)\in\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})^{m} \), the joint k-numerical range
\(W_k(\bf A) \) is the set of \((\alpha_1,..,\alpha_m)\in \mathbb{C^m}\) such that \(\alpha_{i}={\Sigma^{k}_{j=1}} \langle A_{i}x{j},x{j }\rangle \) for an orthonormal set \(\{x_{1},...,x_{k}\} \) in \(\mathcal{H} \). The geometrical properties of
\( W_k(\bf A) \) and their relations with the algebraic properties of \(\{A_{1},...,A_{m}\} \)
are investigated in this paper. First, conditions for\(W_k(\bf A) \) to be convex are
studied, and some results for finite dimensional operators are extended
to the infinite dimensional case. An example of A is constructed such
that \(W_k(\bf A) \) is not convex, but \(W_r(\bf A) \) is convex for all positive integer r
not equal to k. Second, descriptions are given for the closure of \(W_k(\bf A) \)
and the closure of conv\(W_k(\bf A) \) in terms of the joint essential numerical
range of A for infinite dimensional operators\(A_{1},...,A_{m} \) . These lead to
characterizations of \(W_k(\bf A) \)Wk(A) or conv\(W_k(\bf A) \) to be closed. Moreover, it is
shown that conv \(W_k(\bf A) \) is closed whenever \(W_{k+1}(\bf A) \) or conv\(W_{k+1}(\bf A) \) is.
These results are used to study the connection between the geometric
properties of \( W_k(\bf A) \) and algebraic properties of \(A_{1},...,A_{m} \). For instance,
\(W_k(\bf A) \) is a polyhedral set, i.e., the convex hull of a finite set, if and only if
\(A_{1},...,A_{k} \) have a common reducing subspace V of finite dimension such
that the compression of \(A_{1},...,A_{m} \) on the subspace V are diagonal operators
\( D_{1},...,D_{m} \) and \( W_k(A)=W_{k}(D_1,...,D_m) \). Characterization is also
given to A such that the closure of \(W_k(\bf A) \) is polyhedral. For finite rank
operators the following two condition are equivalent: (1) \(A_{1},...,A_{m} \) is a
commuting family of normal operators. (2) \(W_k(A)=W_{k}(A_1,...,A_m) \) is polyhedral
for every positive integer k less than dim\(\mathcal{H} \). However, the two conditions
are not equivalent for compact operators. Characterizations are given for
compact operators \( A_{1},...,A_{m} \) satisfying (1) and (2), respectively. Results
are also obtained for general non-compact operators. Open problems and
future research topics are presented.","Jor-Ting Chan1, Chi-Kwong Li2 & Yiu-Tung Poon",Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44146-022-00018-x,"commuting normal operators,

First, we show that the general Puiseux series for the solution about zero exists under smooth assumptions for the nonlinear function, and then design an algorithm to recover the finite-term truncation of the asymptotic expansion by Picard iteration. This asymptotic expansion can easily yield a more accurate Padé approximation. Second, we use trapezoidal rule to discretize the singular integral and derive the Euler–Maclaurin asymptotic expansion using the known Puiseux expansion of the solution. By accumulating some lower order error terms to the quadrature formula, we obtain high precision evaluations to the nonlinear Volterra integral equation. Third, we prove that the scheme is convergent by extending the Gronwall inequality to be held for the scheme. Fourth, an example is provided to illustrate that the combination of the Puiseux expansion and the numerical integration can effectively increase the computational accuracy of the equation. Finally, we apply the method to solve the Lighthill integral equation, and obtain the asymptotic expansions of the solution near zero and infinity, respectively. The computation shows that the trapezoidal rule is only necessary in a small finite range of the semi-infinite interval.","Tongke Wang

The distance between the walls may be arbitrary, and the surface of one of the walls can be arbitrarily rough. The main objective of this work consists in homogenizing the heterogeneous interface between the rough wall and fluid so as to obtain an equivalent smooth slippery fluid/solid interface characterized by an effective slip length. To solve the corresponding problem, two efficient numerical approaches are elaborated on the basis of the method of fundamental solution (MFS) and the boundary element methods (BEMs). They are applied to different cases where the fluid/solid interface is periodically or randomly rough. The results obtained by the proposed two methods are compared with those given by the finite element method and some relevant ones reported in the literature.

In the robot model used, the current curvature of the trajectory of the objective point which is related by simple algebraic expressions with the angle of rotation of the front wheels was taken as the control parameter. Boundedness of the angle of rotation of the robot front wheels imposes bilateral constraints on the control. The control constraints influence strongly the transients of the robot entering the desired trajectory. Additionally, the nature of the transients depends on the initial conditions. The aim of the paper was to construct the attraction domain guaranteeing the given rate of the transients. The quadratic Lyapunov function was used to approximate this domain. The problem of determining the quadratic Lyapunov functions was reduced to the standard mathematical verification for solvability of the system of linear matrix inequalities. For the case where the aim of control is to drive the robot objective point to the straight segment of the trajectory, the results of calculations of the stability domains were presented for various formulations of the problem.",Yu.

It is shown that on these problems, the known numerical methods are unreliable. They require a sufficient step reducing at some critical moments, and to determine these moments, sufficiently reliable algorithms have not been developed. It is shown that in the choice of time as an argument, the difficulty is associated with the boundary layer.

Finally, the main result in this work is that the pseudospectral method coupled with the carefully designed time-discretizations is stable provided only that the time-step and spatial grid-size are bounded by two constants over a finite time.

We have chosen the Bezier curves as piecewise polynomials of degree n, and determine Bezier curves on any subinterval by \(n+1\) control points. Also, we have used Bezier curves method to solve linear and nonlinear Volterra-Fredholm integral equations, numerically. The proposed method is simple and computationally advantageous. Some numerical examples demonstrate the validity and applicability of the technique.","F. Ghomanjani1, M. H. Farahi2 & N.

We estimate the deviation of the first eigenvalue of the discretized problem from the eigenvalue of the Neumann operator. More exactly, the unsaturated discretization of the spectral Neumann problem yields an algebraic problem with a good matrix, i.e., a matrix inheriting the spectral properties of the Neumann operator. Thus, its spectral portrait lacks “parasitic” eigenvalues provided that the discretization error is sufficiently small.

Besides a common standard parabolic equation for the diffusion of a chemoattractant, like chemokines or growth factors, the two models differ for the equations describing the movement of cells. The first model is based on a quasilinear hyperbolic system with damping, the other one on a degenerate parabolic equation. The two models have the same stationary solutions, which may contain some regions with vacuum. We first explain in details how to discretize the quasilinear hyperbolic system through an upwinding technique, which uses an adapted reconstruction, which is able to deal with the transitions to vacuum. Then we concentrate on the analysis of asymptotic preserving properties of the scheme towards a discretization of the parabolic equation, obtained in the large time and large damping limit, in order to present a numerical comparison between the asymptotic behavior of these two models. Finally we perform an accurate numerical comparison of the two models in the time asymptotic regime, which shows that the respective solutions have a quite different behavior for large times.","Roberto Natalini1, Magali Ribot2,3 & Monika Twarogowska",Journal of Scientific Computing,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-014-9909-y,"Chemotaxis,Quasilinear hyperbolic problems with source, Degenerate parabolic problems,Well-balanced scheme,Asymptotic behavior"

2958,Numerical Study of Thermal Spreading Resistance in Body-Fitted Curvilinear Coordinates,"One of the most important problems encountered in the thermal management of microelectronics is thermal spreading resistance. This occurs either due to the heat transfer by the conduction mechanism from one solid to another with different cross-sectional areas, or as a result of the heat flow through a conductive solid with a variable cross-sectional area. In this study, both geometric conditions are considered simultaneously. A C++ program code is developed to calculate the thermal spreading resistance in arbitrary curved-edge heat spreaders. A method for automatic numerical generation of a body-fitted curvilinear coordinate system is applied to solve the heat conduction equation on the orthogonal curvilinear grids. A set of Poisson equations is then used to generate two-dimensional grids with grid control along all of the boundaries. The finite difference method is employed to discretize the partial differential equations of the problem. In addition, the Maxwell coordinate system is also used as a special case to demonstrate the similarity of grids generated by numerical and analytical methods. The numerical results of the study are compared with the exact solution, thus illustrating the performance of the approach. Finally, the temperature distribution and thermal spreading resistance are determined for the different shapes of curved edges.","Yousef Rahmani1, Mofid Gorji Bandpy1 & Davood Domiri Ganji",International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40819-016-0271-7,"Thermal spreading resistance,Body-fitted curvilinear coordinate system,Poisson equations,Maxwell transform"

We interpret this control problem as a constrained optimization problem, and we develop a reduced SQP method that presents for this problem a new and efficient approach of its numerical solution. As opposed to Newton's method for the unconstrained problem, where at each iteration the state must be computed from a set of nonlinear equations,in the proposed algorithm only the linearized state equations need to be solved. Furthermore, by use of a secant update formula, the calculation of exact second derivatives is avoided. In this way the algorithm achieves a substantial decrease in the total cost compared to the implementation of Newton's method in [2]. Our method is practicable with regard to storage requirements, and by choosing an appropriate representation for the null space of the Jacobian of the constraints we are able to exploit the sparsity pattern of the Jacobian in the course of the iteration.

The main challenge in solving the system numerically is how to develop easy-to-implement time stepping schemes while preserving the unconditional energy stability. We solve this issue by developing two linear and decoupled, first order and a second order time-stepping schemes using the so-called “invariant energy quadratization” approach for the double well potentials and a subtle explicit-implicit technique for the nonlinear coupling potential. Moreover, the resulting linear system is well-posed and the linear operator is symmetric positive definite. We rigorously prove the first order scheme is unconditionally energy stable.

The author understands an automatic solution as obtaining a result without carrying out the stages of selecting a method, programming, and program checking. Both initial and boundary value problems for such equations are solved. It is assumed that the complete set of boundary and initial conditions at the beginning of the integration interval are given. By performing differentiation, the system of IDAEs can be modified, in general, into a system of ordinary nonlinear differential equations (IDEs). The problem of finding the solution of the above-mentioned system on the uniform grid on the integration interval is posed in two forms: as solving the system of IDAEs and as solving the appropriate system of IDEs, where the developed program is to be used. In order to reduce the system of IDAEs and the system of IDEs to the systems of ordinary nonlinear algebraic equations, at every stage of the algorithm the integration and differentiation formulas obtained earlier by N.G. Bandurin are used. Systems similar to those test systems of both nonlinear IDAEs and IDEs considered in this investigation are solved by using the computer programs.

We give a definition for a weak entropy solution (u, v), inspired by the Liu condition for admissible shocks and by Krushkov entropy pairs. We then prove, in the case of a natural generalization of the Riemann problem, the existence of a weak entropy solution only depending on x/t. This property results from the proof of the existence, by passing to the limit on some approximations, of a function g such that u is the classical entropy solution of u

The Pucci’s operator is a prototype of a nonlinear operator in non-divergence form. Non-divergence form makes numerical solution challenging because standard tools like Pohozaev identity and global integration by parts are no longer applicable. Therefore, present study for the numerical solution relies on non-variational finite element method, which is independent of above said tools.

First, we investigate positivity, boundedness, and asymptotic stability of the proposed fractional-order model. Secondly, we construct positivity-preserving nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) schemes for the model using the Mickens’ methodology. We prove theoretically and confirm by numerical simulations that the proposed NSFD schemes are unconditionally positive. Consequently, we obtain NSFD schemes preserving not only the positivity but also essential dynamical properties of the fractional-order model for all finite step sizes. Meanwhile, standard schemes fail to correctly reflect the essential properties of the continuous model for a given finite step size, and therefore, they can generate numerical approximations which are completely different from the solutions of the continuous model. Finally, a set of numerical simulations are performed to support and confirm the validity of theoretical results as well as advantages and superiority of the constructed NSFD schemes. The results indicate that there is a good agreement between the numerical simulations and the theoretical results and the NSFD schemes are appropriate and effective to solve the fractional-order model.","Manh Tuan Hoang1, Zain Ul Abadin Zafar2 & Thi Kim Quy Ngo",Computational and Applied Mathematics,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-020-01326-0,"Stability analysis,Fractional-order SIS epidemic model,Nonstandard finite difference schemes,Unconditionally positive numerical schemes,Lyapunov stability theory"
2975,An Efficient Semi-implicit Solver for Direct Numerical Simulation of Compressible Flows at All Speeds,"We develop a semi-implicit algorithm for time-accurate simulation of compressible shock-free flows, with special reference to wall-bounded flows. The method is based on partial linearization of the convective fluxes in such a way to suppress, or at least mitigate the acoustic time step limitation. Together with replacement of the total energy equation with the entropy transport equation, this approach avoids the inversion of block-banded matrices involved in classical methods, which is replaced by much less demanding inversion of standard banded matrices. The method is extended to deal with implicit integration of viscous terms and to multiple space dimensions through approximate factorization, and used as a building block of a semi-implicit Runge–Kutta scheme which guarantees third-order of accuracy in time (Nikitin in Int J Numer Methods Fluids 51:221–233, 2006). Numerical experiments are carried out for isotropic turbulence, plane channel flow, and flow in a square duct.

2976,Direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows through concentric annulus with circumferential oscillation of inner wall,"Periodic wall oscillations in the spanwise or circumferential direction can greatly reduce the friction drag in turbulent channel and pipe flows. In a concentric annulus, the constant rotation of the inner cylinder can intensify turbulence fluctuations and enhance skin friction due to centrifugal instabilities. In the present study, the effects of the periodic oscillation of the inner wall on turbulent flows through concentric annulus are investigated by the direct numerical simulation (DNS). The radius ratio of the inner to the outer cylinders is 0.1, and the Reynolds number is 2 225 based on the bulk mean velocity Um and the half annulus gap H. The influence of oscillation period is considered. It is found that for short-period oscillations, the Stokes layer formed by the circumferential wall movement can effectively inhibit the near-wall coherent motions and lead to skin friction reduction, while for long-period oscillations, the centrifugal instability has enough time to develop and generate new vortices, resulting in the enhancement of turbulence intensity and skin friction.","Yichen Yao1, Chunxiao Xu1 & Weixi Huang",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-018-2364-7,"turbulence,drag reduction,circumferential oscillation,Taylor vortex"

2978,Numerical solutions of the fractal foam drainage equation,"The flow of liquid relative to the bubbles is called drainage. This paper presents a study of the numerical solution of a non-linear foam drainage equation with time-fractional derivative. We use the two-scale approach which is formulated by combining the fractional complex transform and the homotopy perturbation method (HPM).  With the aid of the fractional complex transform, first, we transform the problem into its differential partner and then HPM is applied to obtain the He’s polynomials which are highly and powerful support for non-linear problems. Further, we put forward the theory of the two-scale approach which reveals the sketch between fractional complex transform and the solution of non-linear foam drainage equation. The significant results illustrate that this approach does not require any assumption while it reduces the heavy calculation without any restrictive variable. This approach also sheds a bright light on practical applications of fractal calculus.

Then this matrix and operational matrix of multiplication of these polynomials are applied to solve the fractional-order optimal control problems by the direct method. As a matter of fact, the functions of the problem are approximated by Bernoulli polynomials with unknown coefficients in the functional and conditions. Therefore, a fractional optimal control problem is converted to an unconstrained optimization problem and then it could be solved via Newton’s iterative method. Also we demonstrate that if the number of Bernoulli basis is increased, this method is convergent.

2989,Efficient Numerical Computations of Long-Wave Run-Up and Their Sensitivity to Grid Nesting,Computation of long-wave run-up has been of high interest in the fields of ocean sciences and geophysics—particularly for tsunami and river flood modeling. An accurate calculation of run-up and inundation requires the numerical model to account for a sequence of critical processes—each of them posing a different challenge to the numerical solution. This study presents the strategic development of a numerical solution technique for shallow water equations with a focus on accuracy and efficiency for long-wave run-up. The present model is based on an explicit second-order finite-volume scheme over a staggered grid that efficiently achieves fundamental properties. The scheme is well-balanced and preserves shock fronts without the need for computationally expensive solvers. The streamlined code serves as a foundation for the implementation of nested grids. Computations of commonly used long-wave benchmark tests showcase that accurate predictions of local extreme run-up can often be achieved with highly refined yet spatially focused nested grids. Strategic grid nesting can lead to stable and accurate solutions of run-up at locations of interest and reduce the computational load to a fraction of what is usually necessary for a comparable solution over a single grid.,"Fatima-Zahra Mihami1, Volker Roeber

The results show that the differences between the temperature field in the single phase and two-phase models are greater than those in the hydrodynamic field. Also, it is found that the heat transfer coefficient predicted by the single phase model is enhanced by increasing the volume fraction of nanoparticles for all Reynolds numbers; while for the two-phase models, when the Reynolds number is low, increasing the volume fraction of nanoparticles will enhance the heat transfer coefficient in the front and the middle of the wavy channel, but gradually decrease along the wavy channel.","M.

The main advantage of the proposed method is obtaining a global approximation for spatial and temporal discretizations, and it reduced the problem to an algebraic system, which is easier to solve. Also, the profit of approximating a continuous function by Hahn polynomials is that for computing the coefficients of the expansion, we only have to compute a summation and the calculation of coefficients is exact.

3002,Numerical Investigations of Thermal Radiation and Activation Energy Imparts on Chemically Reactive Maxwell Fluid Flow Over an Exothermal Stretching Sheet in a Porous Medium,"The impacts of temperature dependent viscosity on radiative Maxwell fluid flow over an autocatalytic stretching sheet with chemical reaction is investigated in this work. Soret effect is invoked in the present study. The strongly nonlinear model equations are changed into system of ordinary differential structure with the help of proper non-dimensional quantities. The fourth order Runge-Kutta Fehlberg (RKF) numerical method is utilized to solve the transformed system of ODEs. The behaviors of flow, thermal and solutal fields under the influence of different model parameters are presented and discussed in detail via graphs and tables. In this study, higher values of Frank-Kamenetskii parameter and permeability parameter is found to escalate temperature distribution. Also, concentration distributions drop rapidly by varying Schmidt number but enhances in the presence of Soret number. Comparison of the present results with previous study is examined and excellent concurrence is observed. The present study is relevant in engineering applications where the formation of boundary layer is to be delayed or enhanced and in oil recovery processes.","D. J. Samuel

3003,Implications of the Choice of Quadrature Nodes for Picard Integral Deferred Corrections Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations,"This paper concerns a class of deferred correction methods recently developed for initial value ordinary differential equations; such methods are based on a Picard integral form of the correction equation. These methods divide a given timestep [t
n
,tn+1] into substeps, and use function values computed at these substeps to approximate the Picard integral by means of a numerical quadrature. The main purpose of this paper is to present a detailed analysis of the implications of the location of quadrature nodes on the accuracy and stability of the overall method. Comparisons between Gauss-Legendre, Gauss-Lobatto, Gauss-Radau, and uniformly spaced points are presented. Also, for a given set of quadrature nodes, quadrature rules may be formulated that include or exclude function values computed at the left-hand endpoint t
n
. Quadrature rules that do not depend on the left-hand endpoint (which are referred to as right-hand quadrature rules) are shown to lead to L(α)-stable implicit methods with α≈π/2. The semi-implicit analog of this property is also discussed. Numerical results suggest that the use of uniform quadrature nodes, as opposed to nodes based on Gaussian quadratures, does not significantly affect the stability or accuracy of these methods for orders less than ten. In contrast, a study of the reduction of order for stiff equations shows that when uniform quadrature nodes are used in conjunction with a right-hand quadrature rule, the form and extent of order-reduction changes considerably. Specifically, a reduction of order to \(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)\) is observed for uniform nodes as opposed to \(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon\Delta{t})\) for non-uniform nodes, where Δt denotes the time step and ε a stiffness parameter such that ε→0 corresponds to the problem becoming increasingly stiff.

A small perturbation parameter multiplies the second order spatial derivative in all the equations. The proposed numerical method uses backward Euler method in time direction on an uniform mesh together with a suitable combination of HODIE scheme and the central difference scheme in spatial direction on a Shishkin mesh. It is proved that the numerical method is parameter-robust of first order in time and almost second order in space. Numerical results are given in support of theoretical findings.,S.

We consider a semi-discretization with respect to the time of the studied evolution problem; then we have to solve a sequence of stationary coupled problems. So, due to the fact that the temperature is assumed to be positive, after reformulation of the problem into a variational inequality, we study under appropriate assumptions the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the stationary coupled problems. We also consider a multivalued formulation of the same problem which allows to analyze the behavior of the iterative relaxation algorithms used for the solution of the discretized problems.

3006,Numerical Study of the Volcano Effect in Chemotactic Aggregation Based on a Kinetic Transport Equation with Non-instantaneous Tumbling,"Aggregation of chemotactic bacteria under a unimodal distribution of chemical cues was investigated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation based on a kinetic transport equation, which considers an internal adaptation dynamics as well as a finite tumbling duration. It was found that there exist two different regimes of the adaptation time, between which the effect of the adaptation time on the aggregation behavior is reversed; that is, when the adaptation time is as small as the running duration, the aggregation becomes increasingly steeper as the adaptation time increases, while, when the adaptation time is as large as the diffusion time of the population density, the aggregation becomes more diffusive as the adaptation time increases. Moreover, the aggregation profile becomes bimodal (volcano) at the large adaptation-time regime when the tumbling duration is sufficiently large while it is always unimodal at the small adaptation-time regime. A remarkable result of this study is the identification of the parameter regime and scaling for the volcano effect. That is, by comparing the results of MC simulations to the continuum-limit models obtained at each of the small and large adaptation-time scalings, it is clarified that the volcano effect arises due to the coupling of diffusion, adaptation, and finite tumbling duration, which occurs at the large adaptation-time scaling.","Shugo Yasuda

3007,Efficient numerical approximation of a non-regular Fokker–Planck equation associated with first-passage time distributions,"In neuroscience, the distribution of a decision time is modelled by means of a one-dimensional Fokker–Planck equation with time-dependent boundaries and space-time-dependent drift. Efficient approximation of the solution to this equation is required, e.g., for model evaluation and parameter fitting. However, the prescribed boundary conditions lead to a strong singularity and thus to slow convergence of numerical approximations. In this article we demonstrate that the solution can be related to the solution of a parabolic PDE on a rectangular space-time domain with homogeneous initial and boundary conditions by transformation and subtraction of a known function. We verify that the solution of the new PDE is indeed more regular than the solution of the original PDE and proceed to discretize the new PDE using a space-time minimal residual method. We also demonstrate that the solution depends analytically on the parameters determining the boundaries as well as the drift. This justifies the use of a sparse tensor product interpolation method to approximate the PDE solution for various parameter ranges. The predicted convergence rates of the minimal residual method and that of the interpolation method are supported by numerical simulations.","Udo Boehm

3009,"Adaptive cubic regularisation methods for unconstrained optimization. Part I: motivation, convergence and numerical results","An Adaptive Regularisation algorithm using Cubics (ARC) is proposed for unconstrained optimization, generalizing at the same time an unpublished method due to Griewank (Technical Report NA/12, 1981, DAMTP, University of Cambridge), an algorithm by Nesterov and Polyak (Math Program 108(1):177–205, 2006) and a proposal by Weiser et al. (Optim Methods Softw 22(3):413–431, 2007). At each iteration of our approach, an approximate global minimizer of a local cubic regularisation of the objective function is determined, and this ensures a significant improvement in the objective so long as the Hessian of the objective is locally Lipschitz continuous. The new method uses an adaptive estimation of the local Lipschitz constant and approximations to the global model-minimizer which remain computationally-viable even for large-scale problems. We show that the excellent global and local convergence properties obtained by Nesterov and Polyak are retained, and sometimes extended to a wider class of problems, by our ARC approach. Preliminary numerical experiments with small-scale test problems from the CUTEr set show encouraging performance of the ARC algorithm when compared to a basic trust-region implementation.","Coralia Cartis1,2, Nicholas I.

3010,A nonlinear fourth-order PDE for image denoising in Sobolev spaces with variable exponents and its numerical algorithm,"Image restoration is a very challenging task in image analysis and plays important roles in various fields such as medical imaging. In particular, in ultrasound imaging the obtained images are usually highly corrupted with multiplicative noise which makes important features hard to detect and to preserve. In this work, we use a mathematical model based on a minimization problem. To preserve the important features of the image, we consider a variable exponent function p(x) chosen adaptively based on the map provided by edge-detectors which are constructed form high-order derivatives. The Euler–Lagrange equation of the minimization problem gives rise to a nonlinear p(x)-biharmonic PDE. We then propose a numerical scheme based on the convexity splitting (CS) method for the ultrasound image denoising and we prove its stability and convergence results. Finally, some numerical results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.","Hamdi Houichet

The results are cast in terms of the local error tolerance. Under theassumption that a local error control strategy is successful, it is shown that a continuous interpolant through the numerical solution exists that satisfies the differential equation to within a small, piecewise continuous, residual. The assumption is known to hold for thematlab ode23 algorithm [10] when applied to a variety of problems.Using the smallness of the residual, it follows that at any finite time the continuous interpolant converges to the true solution as the error tolerance tends to zero. By studying the perturbed differential equation it is also possible to prove discrete analogs of the long-time dynamical properties of the equation—dissipative, contractive and gradient systems are analysed in this way.",D.

3018,Exponential moments for numerical approximations of stochastic partial differential equations,"Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) have become a crucial ingredient in a number of models from economics and the natural sciences. Many SPDEs that appear in such applications include non-globally monotone nonlinearities. Solutions of SPDEs with non-globally monotone nonlinearities are in nearly all cases not known explicitly. Such SPDEs can thus only be solved approximatively and it is an important research problem to construct and analyze discrete numerical approximation schemes which converge with strong convergence rates to the solutions of such SPDEs. In the case of finite dimensional stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs) with non-globally monotone nonlinearities it has recently been revealed that exponential integrability properties of the discrete numerical approximation scheme are a key instrument to establish strong convergence rates for the considered approximation scheme. Exponential integrability properties for appropriate approximation schemes have been established in the literature in the case of a large class of finite dimensional SODEs. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no result in the scientific literature which proves exponential integrability properties for a time discrete approximation scheme in the case of a SPDE. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no result in the scientific literature which establishes strong convergence rates for a time discrete approximation scheme in the case of a SPDE with a non-globally monotone nonlinearity. In this paper we propose a new class of tamed space-time-noise discrete exponential Euler approximation schemes that admit exponential integrability properties in the case of SPDEs. More specifically, the main result of this article proves that these approximation schemes enjoy exponential integrability properties for a large class of semilinear SPDEs with possibly non-globally monotone nonlinearities. In particular, we establish exponential moment bounds for the proposed approximation schemes in the case of stochastic Burgers equations, stochastic Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equations, and two-dimensional stochastic Navier–Stokes equations.","Arnulf Jentzen1 & Primož Pušnik

3023,A Numerical Technique for Solving a Class of Fourth-Order Singular Singularly Perturbed and Emden–Fowler Problems Arising in Astrophysics,"This paper aims to investigate the possible treatment of a class of singular singularly perturbed fourth-order and Lane-Emden type boundary value problems. This model has many applications in different areas of science including astrophysics. The proposed technique is based on expressing the unknown solution in the form of a truncated series based on Bernoulli polynomials with their differentiation matrix. Then, the resulting linear or nonlinear system in terms of the unknown coefficients is solved using an iterative technique to find the unknown coefficients, and hence the solution is found. The error analysis for the numerical scheme was studied to give some insight into the error bound of the proposed technique. The method is then tested on four examples, two of which are a fourth-order singular singularly perturbed problem. The other two problems are of Emden–Fowler nonlinear problems. The method proves the ability to provide accurate solutions to both cases in terms of error and computational cost and through some comparisons with other related techniques. There is no need to use a large number of bases to reach an acceptable error and the method is shown to be straightforward. This method is a promising technique to encounter such problems and can be considered an efficient candidate to simulate such problems with applications in science. .

3024,"Numerical Investigation on Pulsating Hydromagnetic Flow of Chemically Reactive Micropolar Nanofluid in a Channel with Brownian Motion, Thermophoresis and Ohmic Heating","This work examines the behavior of pulsating hydromagnetic flow of micropolar nanofluid in a channel with slip effects by employing Buongiorno’s nanofluid model. The effects of Brownian motion, thermophoresis, and Joule heating (Ohmic heating) are taken into account. A perturbation approach is applied to transform the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and then tackled numerically by adopting the shooting approach via Runge-Kutta fourth-order method. The impacts of velocity, microrotation, temperature, and nanoparticle concentration are depicted graphically with numerous standards of physical parameters. The heat and mass transfer rates are considered and presented through a table. The obtained results reveal that the velocity profiles are diminished by accelerating the Hartmann number and coupling parameter while the velocity is increased by escalating the slip parameter and gyration parameter. The influences of microrotation is increased near to the top wall and diminished near to the bottom wall for intensifying the values of the gyration parameter. The temperature of nanofluid is amplifying with an increment of thermophoresis and Brownian motion parameters while it is diminishing with an enhancement of radiation parameter and magnetic field. Pointedly, the concentration of nanofluid is decreasing with the increase of chemical reaction parameter and thermophoresis parameter. The heat transfer rate is rising due to boosts up the values of the Brownian motion, thermophoresis, and viscous dissipation. Therefore, this analysis is significant in the field of pressure surges, food processing systems, biomedical engineering, cancer therapeutic, and nano-drug delivery in the arteries.","D.

3025,On the Numerical Approximability of Stable Dynamical Systems,"This paper discusses the numerical approximation of stable dynamical systems of ordinary differential equations by general time-stepping methods. The traditional error analysis for this approximation yields estimates for the global discretization error in terms of the local truncations errors with constants generally growing exponentially in time due to the use of a discrete Gronwall inequality. In special cases of monotone systems, global error estimates can be shown to hold uniformly in time provided that also the time stepping scheme possesses certain monotonicity properties. The standard example is the backward Euler method. However, for more general time-stepping schemes, this is not clear even in the monotone case. It is shown here how in general situations certain qualitative stability properties (exponential and quasi-exponential stability) of the solution to be approximated can be used for extending local error estimates to global ones holding uniformly in time. Further, the approximate solutions are likewise stable and, in the autonomous case, tend to equilibrium points.",Rolf Rannacher,Vietnam Journal of Mathematics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10013-018-0297-8,"Stable dynamical systems,Exponential stability,Quasi-exponential stability,Time-stepping schemes,Global error estimates,Discrete stability,Stationary limits"
3026,Numerical solution to the interface problem in a general domain using Moser’s deformation method,"When seeking a solution to the interface problem, the potential theory to represent solution has been widely used. As the solution representation of the interface problem is only well-known for domains with simple inclusion, such as a disk, conformal mapping is often used to transform the arbitrary inclusion to a manageable inclusion to utilize the known solution representation. This paper proposes the construction of a conformal mapping based on Moser’s grid deformation method that generates a transformation with positive Jacobian determinant. By establishing an optimal control problem that minimizes the dissimilarity between transformed and reference images with desired constraints, we constructed an appropriate conformal mapping. Several numerical results prove the validity of our approach.","Eunhye Hong1, Eunjung Lee

The main tools are the classical Marcinkiewicz–Zygmund inequality and ad hoc definitions of function spaces on metric measure spaces. The same techniques are used to prove the existence of point distributions in metric measure spaces with small \(L^p\) discrepancy with respect to certain classes of subsets, for example, metric balls.","Luca Brandolini1, William W.

Standard approaches used either to analyse deterministic multi-step methods or stochastic one-step methods do not carry over to stochastic multi-step schemes. In order to obtain sufficient conditions for asymptotic mean-square stability of stochastic linear two-step-Maruyama methods we construct and apply Lyapunov-type functionals.

3032, On the asymptotic stability properties of Runge-Kutta methods for delay differential equations ," In this paper asymptotic stability properties of Runge-Kutta (R-K) methods for delay differential equations (DDEs) are considered with respect to the following test equation: \( \begin{eqnarray*} \left\{ \begin{array}{ccl} y'(t) & = & a\, y(t) + b\, y(t\,-\tau), \\[0.3cm] y(t) & = & g(t), \end{array} \right. \hskip 0.3cm \begin{array}{r} t > 0, \\[0.3cm] -\tau \leq t \leq 0, \end{array} \end{eqnarray*} \) where \(a,b \in {\Bbb R} ,\,\tau > 0\) and \(g(t)\) is a continuous real-valued function. In the last few years, stability properties of R-K methods applied to DDEs have been studied by numerous authors who have considered regions of asymptotic stability for “any positive delay” (and thus independent of the specific value of \(\tau\)).In this work we direct attention at the dependence of stability regions on a fixed delay \(\tau\). In particular, natural Runge-Kutta methods for DDEs are extensively examined.

3033,Self-similarity in particle-laden flows at constant volume,"This paper deals with the evolution of a localized, constant-volume initial condition on an incline into a spreading descending thin-film solution. Clear fluids in this geometry are known to have a front position that moves according to a t
1/3 scaling law, based on similarity-solution analysis by Huppert (Nature 300:427–429, 1982). The same dynamics are investigated for particle-laden flow using a recently proposed lubrication model and physical experiments. The analysis includes the role of a precursor in the model. In the lubrication model, the height of the precursor significantly influences the position of the fluid front, independent of particles settling in the direction of flow. By comparing theory with experiments it is shown that the t
1/3 scaling law persists, to leading order, for particle-laden flows with particle settling. However, additional physics is needed in the existing lubrication models to quantitatively explain departures from clear-fluid self-similarity due to particle settling.","Natalie Grunewald1, Rachel Levy2, Matthew Mata3, Thomas Ward4 & …Andrea L.

3034,Modeling and Numerical Simulation of Non-Linear FSI Systems for Energy Harvesting Based on Ocean Waves and Beams with Piezoelectric Patches,"In this work, a numerical approach is adopted to solve the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model for energy harvesting from ocean wave motion. A mathematical model is presented based on the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations for the ocean water flow and the large deformation model of beam vibration based on the Euler-Bernoulli theory with piezoelectric patches. The FSI model is solved by coupling the mixed finite element method with the differential quadrature method (DQM) for the spatial discretization of the fluid and structure equations. An implicit time scheme and the Newton-Raphson method are used to solve the flow equations, while an adaptive nonlinear Newmark scheme is implemented to obtain the non-linear dynamic response of the beam deflections. In order to evaluate the root mean square (RMS) of the generated electric power from the piezoelectric patches, the obtained numerical results are coupled with the mathematical expressions of the generated charge and the voltage. The RMS values are investigated with respect to the ratio of cantilever length H to the ocean depth \(L_y\), the ratio of distance d of the cantilever from the entrance to the distance of the flow channel \(L_x\) and the ratio of the width b to the thickness h of the cantilever. Also, the effect of the Reynolds number and the number of the attached piezoelectric patches are discussed. The obtained results show that the RMS increases when \(H/L_y\) and b/h increase, while it decreases when \(d/L_x\) increases. As a result, an increase in the RMS values by more than 4 Watt when increasing the Reylonds number from 100 to 300. Also, the RMS reaches a fixed value when we use more than 3 piezoelectric patches in the cantilver. The presence work is of a great importance in term of design and optimization of new method for energy harvesting from ocean wave via piezoelectric structures.","Yassin Belkourchia

3035,Regularization of inverse heat conduction by combination of rate sensor analysis and analytic continuation,"This paper describes some recent observations associated with (1) clarifying and expanding upon the integral relationship between temperature and heat flux in a half-space; (2) offering an analytic-continuation approach for estimating the surface temperature and heat flux in a one-dimensional geometry based on embedded measurements; and, (3) offering a novel digital filter that supports the use of analytic continuation based on a minimal number of embedded sensors. Key to future inverse analysis must be the proper understanding and generation of rate data associated with both the temperature and heat flux at the embedded location. For this paper, some results are presented that are theoretrically motivated but presently adapted to implement digital filtering. A pulsed surface heat flux is reconstructed by way of a single thermocouple sensor located at a well-defined embedded location in a half space. The proposed low-pass, Gaussian digital filter requires the specification of a cut-off frequency that is obtained by viewing the power spectra of the temperature signal as generated by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). With this in hand, and through the use of an integral relationship between the local temperature and heat flux at the embedded location, the embedded heat flux can be accurately estimated. The time derivatives of the filtered temperature and heat flux are approximated by a simple finite-difference method to provide a sufficient number of terms required by the Taylor series for estimating (i.e., the projection) the surface temperature and heat flux. A numerical example demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed scheme. A series of appendices are offered that describe the mathematical details omitted in the body for ease of reading. These appendices contain important and subtle details germane to future studies.",Jay I.

3036,"Infinite Numerical Computing Applied to Hilbert’s, Peano’s, and Moore’s Curves ","The Peano and the Hilbert curves, denoted by P and H respectively, are historically the first and some of the best known space-filling curves. They have a fractal structure, many variants (as the well-known Moore curve M or a probably new “looped” version \({\overline{H}}\) of H), and a huge number of applications in the most diverse fields of mathematics and experimental sciences. In this paper, we employ a recently proposed computational system, allowing numerical calculations with infinite and infinitesimal numbers, to investigate the behavior of such curves and to highlight the differences with the classical treatment. In particular, we perform several types of computations and give many examples based not only on the curves H and P, but also on their d-dimensional versions \(H^d\) and \(P^d\), respectively. Following our approach, it is easy to apply this new computational methodology to many other geometrical contexts, with interesting advantages such as summarizing in a single (infinite) number, representing the final result of a sequence of computations, much information both on the geometrical meaning of such a sequence and on the base geometrical structure itself.","Luigi Antoniotti1, Fabio Caldarola

3049,Numerical Modeling of the Shock Waves Reflection from a Firm Surface in Mono- and Polydisperse Gas Suspensions,"AbstractIn the paper flows of shock waves in multiphase media are described. Gas suspensions are considered as a multiphase medium—liquid drops or solid particles suspended in a gas. In this work, a continual approach in mathematical modeling of the dynamics of multiphase media is applied. The continual approach involves solving the complete hydrodynamic system of equations for each of the mixture components. The system of equations for the dynamics of each phase includes equation of continuity of density (average density for the dispersed phase), equations of conservation of momentum and energy. The carrier medium is described as a viscous, compressible heat-conducting gas. The mathematical model takes into account the velocity and thermal interaction of the phases of the mixture. The system of equations was solved by the MacCormack explicit finite-difference method of the second order of accuracy. To obtain a monotonic numerical solution, a nonlinear correction scheme was applied to the grid function. The influence of parameters of a disperse phase on speed and the shape of the reflected shockwave was numerically studied in the paper. Results of numerical calculations of the distribution of a shock wave from clean gas to a gas suspension, with the subsequent reflection from a firm surface, are given. Calculations allowed to establish that the intensity of a shock wave, reflected from a firm surface, in a gas suspension increases with a decrease of the number of dispersed particles. It is established that in polydisperse gas suspensions existence of fine fraction leads to an increase in the intensity of the reflected shock wave.",D. A. Gubaidullin1 & D. A.

3050,Two-way interactions between equatorially-trapped waves and the barotropic flow,"Lateral energy exchange between the tropics and the midlatitudes is a topic of great importance for understanding Earth’s climate system. In this paper, the authors address this issue in an idealized set up through simple shallow water models for the interactions between equatorially trapped waves and the barotropic mode, which supports Rossby waves that propagate poleward and can excite midlatitude teleconnection patterns. It is found here that the interactions between a Kelvin wave and a fixed meridional shear (mimicking the jet stream) generates a non-trivial meridional velocity and meridional convergence in phase with the upward motion that can attain a maximum of about 50%, which oscillates on frequencies ranging from one day to 10 days. When, on the other hand, the barotropic flow is forced by slowly propagating Kelvin waves a complex flow pattern emerges; it consists of a phase-locked barotropic response that is equatorially trapped and that propagates eastward with the forcing Kelvin wave and a certain number of planetary Rossby waves that propagate westward and toward the poles as seen in nature. It is suggested here that the poleward propagating waves are to some sort of multi-way resonant interaction with the phase locked response. Moreover, it is shown here that a numerical scheme with dispersion properties that depend on the direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation, namely the 2D central scheme of Nessyahu and Tadmor, can artificially alter significantly the topology of the wave fields and thus should be avoided in climate models.","James Ferguson1, Boualem Khouider1 & Maryam Namazi","Chinese Annals of Mathematics, Series B",2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11401-009-0102-9,"Equatorially trapped waves,Wave interactions,Jet stream,Rossby waves,Phase locked,Dispersion relation,Central scheme,Climate modeling"

3136,Numerical Treatment of Stokes Solvent Flow and Solute–Solvent Interfacial Dynamics for Nonpolar Molecules,"We design and implement numerical methods for the incompressible Stokes solvent flow and solute–solvent interface motion for nonpolar molecules in aqueous solvent. The balance of viscous force, surface tension, and van der Waals type dispersive force leads to a traction boundary condition on the solute–solvent interface. To allow the change of solute volume, we design special numerical boundary conditions on the boundary of a computational domain through a consistency condition. We use a finite difference ghost fluid scheme to discretize the Stokes equation with such boundary conditions. The method is tested to have a second-order accuracy. We combine this ghost fluid method with the level-set method to simulate the motion of the solute–solvent interface that is governed by the solvent fluid velocity. Numerical examples show that our method can predict accurately the blow up time for a test example of curvature flow and reproduce the polymodal (e.g., dry and wet) states of hydration of some simple model molecular systems.","Hui Sun1, Shenggao Zhou2, David K.

The decay rate of the semi-discrete systems turns out to depend on the mesh size h of the discretization and tends to zero as h goes to zero. We prove that adding a suitable vanishing numerical viscosity term leads to a uniform (with respect to the mesh size) exponential decay of the energy of solutions. This numerical viscosity term damps out the high frequency numerical spurious oscillations while the convergence of the scheme towards the original damped wave equation is kept.

The maximal extent of pathway activation (maximum amplitude) and the time-to-peak-response (position) are key determinants of biological responses that have been linked to specific outcomes. We investigate how the maximum amplitude of pathway activation and its position depend on the input and wiring of a signaling network. For this purpose, we consider a simple reaction A→B that is regulated by a transient input and extended this to include back-reaction and additional partners. In particular, we show that a unique maximum of B(t) exists. Moreover, we prove that the position of the maximum is independent of the applied input but regulated by degradation reactions of B. Indeed, the time-to-peak-response decreases with increasing degradation rate, which we prove for small models and show in simulations for more complex ones. The identified dependencies provide insights into design principles that facilitate the realization dynamical characteristics like constant position of maximal pathway activation and thereby guide the characterization of unknown kinetics within larger protein networks.","Fabian J.

Here, we consider the numerical approximation of a phase-field surfactant model with fluid flow. The nonlinearly coupled model consists of two Cahn–Hilliard-type equations and incompressible Navier–Stokes equation. With the introduction of two auxiliary variables, the governing system is transformed into an equivalent form, which allows the nonlinear potentials to be treated efficiently and semi-explicitly. By certain subtle explicit-implicit treatments to stress and convective terms, we construct first and second-order time marching schemes, which are extremely efficient and easy-to-implement, for the transformed governing system. At each time step, the schemes involve solving only a sequence of linear elliptic equations, and computations of phase-field variables, velocity and pressure are fully decoupled. We further establish a rigorous proof of unconditional energy stability for the first-order scheme. Numerical results in both two and three dimensions are obtained, which demonstrate that the proposed schemes are accurate, efficient and unconditionally energy stable. Using our schemes, we investigate the effect of surfactants on droplet deformation and collision under a shear flow, where the increase of surfactant concentration can enhance droplet deformation and inhibit droplet coalescence.","Guangpu Zhu

The Clenshaw and Curtis scheme for the numerical integration and the Rayleigh–Ritz method are used to estimate the state and control variables. Moreover, the error bound of the fractional derivative operator approximation of Caputo–Katugampola is derived.

Equations with such nonlinearities arise in dynamic meteorology, geometric optics, elasticity and differential geometry. In some special cases heuristic procedures for numerical solution are available, but in order for them to be successful a good initial guess is required. For a bounded convex domain, nonnegativef and Dirichlet data we consider a special discretization of the equation based on its geometric interpretation. For the discrete version of the problem we propose an iterative method that produces a monotonically convergent sequence. No special information about an initial guess is required, and to initiate the iterates a routine step is made. The method is self-correcting and is structurally suitable for a parallel computer.

Several numerical examples are carried out in order to demonstrate the performance and ability of the proposed schemes. Numerical results indicate that the proposed schemes improve remarkably the computational accuracy rather than the empirical finite difference scheme.

Convergence is demonstrated to be a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for accuracy. Inviscid flow physics set requirements regarding grid-point distribution in order for physically accurate results to be obtained. These requirements are relevant to the viscous problem also and are shown to be related to the resolution of the critical layers. In this respect, high-resolution nonlinear calculations based on the inviscid initial-boundary-value problem are presented for a model shear-layer flow, aiming at identification of the regions that require attention in the course of high-Reynolds-number viscous calculations. The results bear a remarkable resemblance with those pertinent to viscous flow, with a cascade of high-shear regions being shed towards the vortex-core centre as time progresses.

The aim of this paper is to present an iterative scheme for the steady state solutions of a finite difference system which corresponds to the coupled nonlinear boundary value problems. This iterative scheme is based on the method of upper-lower solutions which leads to two monotone sequences from some uncoupled linear systems. It is shown that each of the two sequences converges to a nontrivial solution of the discrete equations.

3206,CFL-Violating Numerical Schemes for a Two-Fluid Model,"In this paper we propose a class of linearly implicit numerical schemes for a two-phase flow model, allowing for violation of the CFL-criterion for all waves. Based on the Weakly Implixit Mixture Flux (WIMF) approach [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 26 (2005), pp. 1449–1484], we here develop an extension denoted as Strongly Implicit Mixture Flux (SIMF). Whereas the WIMF schemes are restricted by a weak CFL condition which relates time steps to the fluid velocity, the SIMF schemes are able to break the CFL conditions corresponding to both the sonic and advective velocities. The schemes possess some desirable features compared to current industrial pressure-based codes. They allow for sequential updating of the momentum and mass variables on a nonstaggered grid by solving two sparse linear systems. The schemes are conservative in all convective fluxes and consistency between the mass variables and pressure is formally maintained. Numerical experiments are presented to shed light on the inherent differences between the WIMF and SIMF families of schemes. In particular, we demonstrate that the WIMF scheme is able to give an exact resolution of a moving contact discontinuity. The SIMF schemes do not possess the “exact resolution” property of WIMF, however, the ability to take larger time steps can be exploited so that more efficient calculations can be made when accurate resolution of sharp fronts is not essential, e.g. to calculate steady state solutions.",Steinar Evje1 & Tore Flåtten1 nAff,Journal of Scientific Computing,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-005-9000-9,"Two-phase flow,two-fluid model,hyperbolic system of conservation laws,flux splitting,implicit scheme"

We study the shear layer instability of the flow considering different scenarios, either an impulsively started plate or an uniformly accelerated plate, for Reynolds number \(Re = 9500\). The volume penalization method, with either a Fourier spectral or a wavelet discretization, is used to model the plate geometry with no-slip boundary conditions, where the geometry of the plate is simply described by a mask function. On both tips, we observe the formation of thin shear layers which are rolling up into spirals and form two primary vortices. The self-similar scaling of the spirals corresponds to the theoretical predictions of Saffman for the inviscid case. At later times, these vortices are advected downstream and the free shear layers undergo a secondary instability. We show that their formation and subsequent dynamics is highly sensitive to the shape of the tips. Finally, we also check the influence of a small riblet, added on the back of the plate on the flow evolution.","Kai Schneider1, Mickaël Paget-Goy2, Alberto Verga3 & …Marie Farge",Computational and Applied Mathematics,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-013-0076-9,"Instability of shear layers,Vortex dynamics,Computational methods in fluid dynamics,Free shear layers,Wavelets,Spectral methods"

By using the bandwidth dissipation optimization method (BDOM), the linear dissipation of the original MP scheme of Suresh and Huynh (J. Comput. Phys. 136, 83–99, 1997) is significantly reduced in the newly developed MP-LD scheme. Meanwhile, to reduce the nonlinear dissipation and errors, the shock sensor of Ducros et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 152, 517–549, 1999) is adopted to avoid the activation of the MP limiter in regions away from shock waves. Simulations of turbulent flows with and without shock waves indicate that, in comparison with the original MP scheme, the MP-LD scheme has the same capability in capturing shock waves but a better performance in resolving small-scale turbulence fluctuations without introducing excessive numerical dissipation, which implies the MP-LD scheme is a valuable tool for the direct numerical simulation and large eddy simulation of high-speed turbulent flows with shock waves.","Jian Fang1, Zhaorui Li2 & Lipeng Lu",Journal of Scientific Computing,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-012-9663-y,"Bandwidth dissipation optimization method,MP-LD scheme,Turbulence simulation,Shock-capturing"

Based on the unified approach proposed in Zhang et al. (Phys Rev E 78:026709, 2008), Zhang et al. (Phys Rev E 79:046711, 2009), the nonlinear absorbing boundary conditions for one-dimensional and two-dimensional nonlinear parabolic integro-differential PDEs are derived. Thus the original problem on the unbounded spatial domain is reduced to an initial-boundary-value (IBV) problem on a bounded computational domain. Secondly, a simple but efficient adaptive time-stepping scheme for the reduced IBV problem is achieved by using the fixed point method to make the finite difference approximation stable at each time level. At each time level, we also prove that the lower bound and upper bound of the blow-up time can be bounded by the numerical blow-up times of the forward and backward Euler schemes. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated by a broad range of numerical examples, including a problem with a circle line blow-up.","Hermann Brunner1,2, Tao Tang3 & Jiwei Zhang",Journal of Scientific Computing,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-016-0179-8,"Nonlinear parabolic integro-differential PDEs,Unbounded spatial domains,Unified approach,Finite time blow-up,Nonlinear absorbing boundary conditions,Adaptive time-stepping"

The solution and boundary conditions can be expanded by eigensolutions using adjoint relationships of the symplectic ortho-normalization between the eigensolutions. A closed method of the symplectic eigensolution is presented based on completeness of the symplectic eigensolution space. The results show that fundamental flows can be described by zero eigenvalue eigensolutions, and local effects by nonzero eigenvalue eigensolutions.

The generalized Bagley–Torvik equation is studied along with initial and boundary conditions to investigate numerical solution in the Caputo–Fabrizio sense. Regarding the generalized Bagley–Torvik equation with initial conditions, in order to have a better approach and lower cost, we reformulate the issue as a system of fractional differential equations while preserving the second type of these equations. Reproducing kernel functions are established to construct an orthogonal system used to formulate the analytical and approximate solutions of both equations in the appropriate Hilbert spaces. The feasibility of the proposed method and the effect of the novel derivative with the nonsingular kernel were verified by listing and treating several numerical examples with the required accuracy and speed.

Both schemes rely on a new approach to time approximation, specifically, on Maxwell’s equations represented in integral form with respect to time. The spatial derivatives in both schemes are approximated to fourth-order accuracy. The first scheme uses field equations and is second-order accurate in time.

Comparative test computations show that the schemes have a number of important advantages over those based on finite-difference approximations of time derivatives. Additionally, the potential scheme is shown to possess better properties than the field scheme.","O. I. Akhmetov1, V. S. Mingalev1, I. V. Mingalev1, O. V. Mingalev1 & …Yu. V.

class consists of algorithms which recover the solution by
exploiting some special formulae that these solutions are known to

We show first that using a direct algorithm -- a one-step scheme or
a strictly stable multistep scheme (explicit or implicit) -- limits
the order of the numerical method to one if we want to guarantee
that the computed solution stays positive definite. Then we show two
ways to obtain positive definite higher order approximations by
using indirect algorithms. The first is to apply a symplectic

An axisymmetric volume-of-fluid (VOF) method is used to simulate the motion of each drop toward a symmetry plane where it interacts and possibly coalesces with its mirror image. The volume-fraction boundary condition on the symmetry plane is manipulated to numerically control coalescence. Two new numerical methods have been developed to incorporate the van der Waals forces in the Navier–Stokes equations. One method employs a body force computed as the negative gradient of the van der Waals potential. The second method employs the van der Waals forces in terms of a disjoining pressure in the film depending on the film thickness. Results are compared to theory of thin-film rupture. Comparisons of the results obtained by the two methods at various values of the Hamaker constant show that the van der Waals forces calculated from the two methods have qualitatively similar effects on coalescence. A study of the influence of the van der Waals forces on the evolution and rupture of the film separating the drops reveals that the film thins faster under stronger van der Waals forces. Strong van der Waals forces lead to nose rupture, and small van der Waals forces lead to rim rupture. Increasing the Reynolds number causes a greater drop deformation and faster film drainage. Increasing the viscosity ratio slows film drainage, although the effect is small for small viscosity ratio.",X. Jiang1 & A. J.

The numerical methods are developed by making direct replacements of the derivatives in the differential equations and then by computing the eigenvalues, which may incorporate Rayleigh number, horizontal wave speed and a time constant, from the resulting algebraic eigenvalue problem. The eigenvalues are also computed by writing the differential equations as systems of second-order differential equations and then using second- and fourth-order methods to obtain the eigenvalues. Numerical results obtained using the two approaches are compared with estimates appearing in the literature.","E. H. Twizell1, A. Boutayeb1 nAff2 & K.

3236,"PeliGRIFF, a parallel DEM-DLM/FD direct numerical simulation tool for 3D particulate flows","The problem of particulate flows at moderate to high concentration and finite Reynolds number is addressed by parallel direct numerical simulation. The present contribution is an extension of the work published in Computers & Fluids 38:1608 (2009), where systems of moderate size in a 2D geometry were examined. At the numerical level, the suggested method is inspired by the framework established by Glowinski et al. (Int J Multiph Flow 25:755, 1999) in the sense that their Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Domain (DLM/FD) formulation and their operator-splitting idea are employed. In contrast, particle collisions are handled by an efficient Discrete Element Method (DEM) granular solver, which allows one to consider both smoothly (sphere) and non-smoothly (angular polyhedron) shaped particles. From a computational viewpoint, a basic though efficient strategy has been developed to implement the DLM/FD method in a domain decomposition/distributed fashion. To achieve this goal, the serial code, GRIFF (GRains In Fluid Flow; see Comput Fluids 38:1608–1628, 2009) is upgraded to fully MPI capabilities. The new code, PeliGRIFF (Parallel Efficient Library for GRains in Fluid Flow) is developed under the framework of the fully MPI open-source platform PELICANS. The parallel computing capabilities of PeliGRIFF offer new perspectives in the study of particulate flows and indeed increase the number of particles usually simulated in the literature. Solutions to address new issues raised by the parallelization of the DLM/FD method and assess the scalable properties of the code are proposed. Results on the 2D/3D sedimentation of a significant collection of isometric polygonal/polyhedral particles in a Newtonian fluid with collisions are presented as a validation test and an illustration of the class of particulate flows PeliGRIFF is able to investigate.",Anthony Wachs,Journal of Engineering Mathematics,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10665-010-9436-2,"Discrete Element Method,Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Domain method,Parallel computing,Particulate flow,Polygonal/polyhedral shape,Sedimentation"

This method is based on a combination of a Laguerre transformation with respect to the time variable and an integral equation approach in the spatial variables. Using the Laguerre transformation in time reduces the parabolic problem to a sequence of stationary elliptic problems which are solved by a boundary layer approach giving a sequence of boundary integral equations of the first kind to solve. Under the assumption that the boundary surface of the solution domain has a one-to-one mapping onto the unit sphere, these integral equations are transformed and rewritten over this sphere. The numerical discretisation and solution are obtained by a discrete projection method involving spherical harmonic functions. Numerical results are included.","Roman Chapko1 & B. Tomas Johansson

In order to take effective measures against such accidents, the knowledge of behavior of oil in such accidents is urgently required.

A flow field of seawater and spilled oil above and under the beach is simulated numerically in this study. This research effort adopts the Cross model as a constitutive equation for spilled oil. Oil adhesion properties are taken into consideration through a friction type boundary condition prescribed on the surface of spilled oil. Flow equations for respective fluids and boundary conditions between them are unified into a single flow equation to construct a numerical model.

3241,Numerical Solution of a Surface Hypersingular Integral Equation by Piecewise Linear Approximation and Collocation Methods,"AbstractA linear hypersingular integral equation is considered on a surface (closed or nonclosed with a boundary). This equation arises when the Neumann boundary value problem for the Laplace equation is solved by applying the method of boundary integral equations and the solution is represented in the form of a double-layer potential. For such an equation, a numerical scheme is constructed by triangulating the surface, approximating the solution by a piecewise linear function, and applying the collocation method at the vertices of the triangles approximating the surface. As a result, a system of linear equations is obtained that has coefficients expressed in terms of integrals over partition cells containing products of basis functions and a kernel with a strong singularity. Analytical formulas for finding these coefficients are derived. This requires the computation of the indicated integrals. For each integral, a neighborhood of the singular point is traversed so that the system of linear equations approximates the integrals of the unknown function at the collocation points in the sense of the Hadamard finite part. The method is tested on some examples.",A. V. Setukha1 & A. V.

3255,High order A-stable numerical methods for stiff problems,"Stiff problems pose special computational difficulties because explicit methods cannot solve these problems without severe limitations on the stepsize. This idea is illustrated using a contrived linear test problem and a discretized diffusion problem. Even though the Euler method can solve these problems if the stepsize is small enough, there is no such limitation for the implicit Euler method. To obtain high order A-stable methods, it is traditional to turn to Runge-Kutta methods or to linear multistep methods. Each of these has limitations of one sort or another and we consider, as a middle ground, the use of general linear (or multivalue multistage) methods. Methods possessing the property of inherent Runge-Kutta stability are identified as promising methods within this large class, and an example of one of these methods is discussed. The method in question, even though it has four stages, out-performs the implicit Euler method if sufficient accuracy is required, because of its higher order.",J. C.

For R/r exceeding about 30, where r and R are the radii of the inner and outer boundary spheres, it is established that the convergence rate of the method is lower (and considerably lower for large R/r) than the convergence rate of its differential version. For this reason, a really simpler, more slowly converging modification of the original method is constructed on the differential level and a finite-element implementation of this modification is built. Numerical experiments have revealed that this modification has the same convergence rate as its differential counterpart for R/r of up to 5 × 103. When the multigrid method is used to solve the split and auxiliary boundary value problems arising at iterations, the modification is more efficient than the original method starting from R/r ∼ 30 and is considerably more efficient for large values of R/r. It is also established that the convergence rates of both methods depend little on the stretching coefficient η of circularly rectangular mesh cells in a range of η that is well sufficient for effective use of the multigrid method for arbitrary values of R/r smaller than ∼ 5 × 103.",B.

3260,A well-balanced numerical scheme for a model of two-phase flows with treatment of nonconservative terms,"We construct a numerical scheme for a model of two-phase flows. The keystone is the treatment of nonconservative terms using stationary contact discontinuities. The nonconservative terms are absorbed into left-hand and right-hand states of the local stationary contact discontinuity at each grid node. The numerical scheme is built by taking into accounts the states on both sides of local contact discontinuities as supplemented facts of a standard numerical approximation for the conservative part of the system. The scheme is shown to possess interesting properties: it preserves the positivity of the volume fractions in both phases and the positivity of the gas density, it is well-balanced and satisfying the numerical minimum entropy principle in the gas phase.",Mai Duc Thanh,Advances in Computational Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-019-09704-x,"Two-phase flow,Nonconservative term,Numerical approximation,Well-balanced scheme,Accuracy,Shock,Discontinuity"

3263,An analytical and numerical study of the two-dimensional Bratu equation,"Bratu's problem, which is the nonlinear eigenvalue equationΔu+λ exp(u)=0 withu=0 on the walls of the unit square andλ as the eigenvalue, is used to develop several themes on applications of Chebyshev pseudospectral methods. The first is the importance ofsymmetry: because of invariance under the C4 rotation group and parity in bothx andy, one can slash the size of the basis set by a factor of eight and reduce the CPU time by three orders of magnitude. Second, the pseudospectral method is ananalytical as well as a numerical tool: the simple approximationλ≈3.2A exp(−0.64A), whereA is the maximum value ofu(x, y), is derived via collocation with but a single interpolation point, but is quantitatively accurate for small and moderateA. Third, the Newton-Kantorovich/Chebyshev pseudospectral algorithm is so efficient that it is possible to compute good numerical solutions—five decimal places—on amicrocomputer inbasic. Fourth, asymptotic estimates of the Chebyshev coefficients can be very misleading: the coefficients for moderately or strongly nonlinear solutions to Bratu's equations fall off exponentially rather than algebraically withv untilv is so large that one has already obtained several decimal places of accuracy. The corner singularities, which dominate the behavior of the Chebyshev coefficients in thelimit v→∞, are so weak as to be irrelevant, and replacing Bratu's problem by a more complicated and realistic equation would merely exaggerate the unimportance of the corner branch points even more.",John P.

In this paper we consider a Variational Streamline Approximation (VSA) which introduces streamline curvature. Comparing results with Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) and the existing Straight Streamline Approximation (SSA) model, we find that the VSA improves the predictive accurary of streamlines modelling compared to DNS calculations, capturing the shock front and sonic surfaces with greater accuracy than SSA.","Malcolm Cartwright

We state three different homogenization results using the method of two-scale convergence. In addition to the averaged macroscopic equations, auxiliary cell problems are solved in order to provide closed-form expressions for effective coefficients. Our aim is to study numerically the convergence of the models for vanishing microstructure, i. e., the behavior for \(\varepsilon \rightarrow 0\), where \(\varepsilon \) is the characteristic ratio between pore diameter and size of the porous medium. To this end, we propose a numerical scheme capable of solving the fully coupled microscopic SNPP system and also the corresponding averaged systems. The discretization is performed fully implicitly in time using mixed finite elements in two space dimensions. The averaged models are evaluated using simulation results and their approximation errors in terms of \(\varepsilon \) are estimated numerically.","Florian Frank1, Nadja Ray1 & Peter Knabner",Computing and Visualization in Science,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00791-013-0189-0,"Homogenization,Two-scale convergence,Porous media,Stokes/Darcy–Nernst–Planck–Poisson system,Colloidal transport,Numerical simulation, Mixed finite elements"

$L^2$-Approximations of power and logarithmic functions with applications to numerical conformal mapping"," For a bounded Jordan domain G with quasiconformal boundary L, two-sided estimates are obtained for the error in best \(L^2(G)\) polynomial approximation to functions of the form \((z-\tau)^{\beta}, {\beta}>-1\), and \((z-\tau)^m\log^l(z-\tau), m>-1, l\ne 0\), where \(\tau\in L\). Furthermore, Andrievskii's lemma that provides an upper bound for the \(L^\infty(G)\) norm of a polynomial \(p_n\) in terms of the \(L^2(G)\) norm of \(p_n^\prime\) is extended to the case when a finite linear combination (independent of n) of functions of the above form is added to \(p_n\). For the case when the boundary of G is piecewise analytic without cusps, the results are used to analyze the improvement in rate of convergence achieved by using augmented, rather than classical, Bieberbach polynomial approximants of the Riemann mapping function of G onto a disk.

3271,Application of Quasi-Gas Dynamic Equations to Numerical Simulation of Near-Wall Turbulent Flows,"We describe the possibilities of a numerical method based on quasi-gas dynamic (QGD) equations for the numerical simulation of a turbulent boundary layer. A subsonic Couette flow in nitrogen is used as an example, with dynamic Reynolds numbers of 153 and 198. The QGD system differs from the system of Navier–Stokes equations by additional nonlinear dissipative terms with a small parameter as a coefficient. In turbulent flow simulation, these terms describe small-scale effects that are not resolved on the grid. Comparison of our results (velocity profiles and mean-square velocity pulsations) with direct numerical simulation (DNS) results and benchmark experiments show that the QGD algorithm adequately describes the viscous and the logarithmic layers near the wall. Compared with high-accuracy DNS methods, the QGD algorithm permits using a relatively large spatial grid increment in the interior part of the viscous sublayer. Thus, the total number of grid points in the turbulent boundary layer may be relatively small. Unlike various versions of the large-eddy simulation (LES) method, the QGD algorithm does not require introduction of near-wall functions, because the additional terms vanish near the wall. For small Reynolds numbers, the QGD algorithm describes laminar Couette flow.",I. A. Shirokov1 & T. G.

The main thrust of this approach is to decompose the domain of the problem into two subintervals. The singularity, which lies in the first subinterval, is removed via the application of an operational matrix procedure based on differentiating that is applied to surmount the singularity. Then, in the second subdomain, which is outside the vicinity of the singularity, the resulting problem is treated via employing the proposed basis. The performance of the numerical scheme is assessed and tested on specific test problems. The oxygen diffusion problem in spherical cells and a nonlinear heat-conduction model of the human head are discussed as illustrative examples. The numerical outcomes indicate that the method yields highly accurate results and is computationally more efficient than the existing ones.","Mohamadreza Mohsenyzadeh1, Khosrow Maleknejad1 & Reza Ezzati",Advances in Difference Equations,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13662-015-0572-x,"34L30,34L16"

A cylindrical shell arbitrarily loaded by inertial forces and pressure is considered under the combined fastening conditions at its ends. The grid method according to the explicit scheme has made it possible to transform the equation system of the shell theory to eight differential equations of the first order with respect to the meridional coordinate and the fourth order with respect to the circumferential coordinate to the system of algebraic equations with a five-diagonal matrix, whose non-zero elements are eight-order matrices. To solve the system of algebraic equations with a rare matrix of non-zero elements, the sweep method is applied in which the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of “sweep” vectors is used to eliminate the accumulation of computational errors, which allows us to exclude the formation of a singular matrix from the “sweep” vectors when calculating the coefficients of the solution to the boundary value problem. An example is considered in which the stress-strain state of the shell of the boiler of a railway tank undergoes the internal forces variable along the meridional and circumferential coordinates and has a rigid fastening at each end of one part of the circle and a free state at another part.",P.

With \(h=T/n\), these numerical quadrature formulas read $$\begin{aligned} {\widehat{T}}{}^{(0)}_n[f]&=h\sum ^{n-1}_{j=1}f(t+jh) -\frac{\pi ^2}{3}\,g'(t)\,h^{-1}+\frac{1}{6}\,g'''(t)\,h,\\ {\widehat{T}}{}^{(1)}_n[f]&=h\sum ^n_{j=1}f(t+jh-h/2) -\pi ^2\,g'(t)\,h^{-1}, \\ {\widehat{T}}{}^{(2)}_n[f]&=2h\sum ^n_{j=1}f(t+jh-h/2)- \frac{h}{2}\sum ^{2n}_{j=1}f(t+jh/2-h/4). \end{aligned}$$We also showed that these formulas have spectral accuracy; that is, $$\begin{aligned} {\widehat{T}}{}^{(s)}_n[f]-I[f]=o(n^{-\mu })\quad \text {as }n\rightarrow \infty \quad \forall \mu >0. \end{aligned}$$In the present work, we continue our study of these formulas for the special case in which \(f(x)=\frac{\cos \frac{\pi (x-t)}{T}}{\sin ^3\frac{\pi (x-t)}{T}}\,u(x)\), where u(x) is in \(C^\infty ({\mathbb {R}})\) and is T-periodic. Actually, we prove that \({\widehat{T}}{}^{(s)}_n[f]\), \(s=0,1,2,\) are exact for a class of singular integrals involving T-periodic trigonometric polynomials of degree at most \(n-1\); that is, $$\begin{aligned} {\widehat{T}}{}^{(s)}_n[f]=I[f]\quad \text {when } f(x)=\frac{\cos \frac{\pi (x-t)}{T}}{\sin ^3\frac{\pi (x-t)}{T}}\,\sum ^{n-1}_{m=-(n-1)} c_m\exp (\mathrm {i}2m\pi x/T). \end{aligned}$$We also prove that, when u(z) is analytic in a strip \(\big |\text {Im}\,z\big |<\sigma \) of the complex z-plane, the errors in all three \({\widehat{T}}{}^{(s)}_n[f]\) are \(O(e^{-2n\pi \sigma /T})\) as \(n\rightarrow \infty \), for all practical purposes.","Avram Sidi

We consider a model describing water-gas flow through engineered and geological barriers for a deep repository of radioactive waste. We consider a domain made up of several zones with different characteristics: porosity, absolute permeability, relative permeabilities and capillary pressure curves. This process can be formulated as a coupled system of partial differential equations which includes a nonlinear parabolic gas-pressure equation and a nonlinear degenerated parabolic water-saturation equation. Both equations are of diffusion-convection type. An implicit vertex-centred finite volume method is adopted to discretize the coupled system. A Godunov-type method is used to treat the convection terms and a conforming finite element method with piecewise linear elements is used for the discretization of the diffusion terms. An averaging technique is developed to obtain an effective capillary pressure curve at the interface of two media. Our numerical model is verified with 1D semi-analytical solutions in heterogeneous media. We also present 2D numerical results to demonstrate the significance of capillary heterogeneity in flow and to illustrate the performance of the method for the FORGE cell scale benchmark.","Brahim Amaziane1, Mustapha El Ossmani2 & Mladen Jurak",Computing and Visualization in Science,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00791-013-0196-1,"Finite volume,Heterogeneous porous media,Hydrogen migration,Immiscible compressible, Nuclear waste ,Two-phase flow,Vertex-centred"

3289,Application of coordinate transformations in numerical simulation of tsunami runup by the large particle method,"A numerical algorithm for computing the runup of a solitary tsunami wave in the case of complex shoreline topography is proposed. The algorithm involves the construction of coordinate mappings that transform a uniform rectangular grid over a reference computational domain into a grid over a physical domain with mesh refinement near the shoreline. The application of such coordinate mappings makes it possible to substantially reduce the number of grid points and save computation time. The mathematical model is based on the shallow water equations, and the problem is solved using the large particle method.

3291,A meshless numerical wave tank for simulation of fully nonlinear wave–wave and wave–current interactions,"A meshless method is proposed to simulate fully nonlinear wave–wave and wave–current interactions in the time domain. The fully nonlinear free surface motion is simulated using the local radial point interpolation collocation method (LRPICM), material node approach, and fourth-order Runge–Kutta method (RK4). LRPICM is a truly meshless method and efficient for moving-boundary problems. Potential theory is used to describe the fluid flow, and the Laplace equation is solved in the Eulerian frame using LRPICM at each time step. The material node approach and RK4 are used to update the free surface boundary conditions. A regridding algorithm based on radial basis function interpolation is used to update the free surface moving boundary in a stable and accurate manner. The incident waves are imposed by feeding determined analytical waves on the input boundary. An efficient artificial damping zone is placed on the free surface before the downstream wall boundary to absorb wave energy and avoid any reflection of the waves. The numerical solutions are compared with experimental data, theoretical results, and other available numerical simulations.","Morteza Gholamipoor

3294,Numerical simulation of separated boundary-layer flow,"The numerical simulation of time-dependent, 2-D compressible boundary-layer flow containing a region of separation is studied. The separation is generated by the introduction of an adverse pressure gradient along the freestream boundary. In order to validate the numerical method, a low Mach-number laminar separation bubble flow is considered, which enables an extensive comparison with incompressible results. The generation of an adverse pressure gradient along the freestream boundary can be realized in various ways. An imposed decelerating flow boundary is compared with a suction technique. The effects of the strength of the pressure gradient and the presence of small upstream perturbations on the separation bubble are also investigated. The time-averaged characteristics of the flow are in good quantitative agreement with incompressible approximate theories predicting the condition for separation. The appearance of self-excited vortex shedding in unperturbed flows under a sufficiently strong adverse pressure gradient is consistent with incompressible flow simulations reported in the literature. The satisfactory result achieved in the calculation of the low-Mach-number flow encourages the application of the numerical method to flows with strong compressibility effects.","B. Wasistho1, B. J.

For instance, it appears in fields like fluid dynamics, biological models and chemical kinetics. One of the most important physical applications is the heat transfer in heterogeneous materials, where physician are looking for efficient methods to solve their modeled equations. The difficulty of solving integro-differential equations analytically made mathematician to search about efficient methods to find an approximate solution. The present article is designed to supply numerical solution of a parabolic Volterra integro-differential equation under initial and boundary conditions. We have made an attempt to develop a numerical solution via the use of Sinc-Galerkin method, the convergence analysis via the use of fixed point theory has been discussed, and showed to be of exponential order. For comparison purposes, we approximate the solution of integro-differential equation using Adomian decomposition method. Sometimes, the Adomian decomposition method is a highly efficient technique used to approximate analytical solution of differential equations, applicability of Adomian decomposition method to partial integro-differential equations has not been studied in details previously in the literatures.

The implementation of high-order WENO schemes for multi-species non-reacting Navier-Stokes (NS) solver has been validated through selective test problems. A comparative study of performance behavior of different WENO schemes has been made on a 2D spatially-evolving mixing layer interacting with oblique shock. The Bandwidth-optimized WENO scheme with total variation relative limiters is found to be less dissipative than the classical WENO scheme, but prone to exhibit some dispersion errors in relatively coarse meshes. Based on its accuracy and minimum dissipation error, the choice of this scheme has been made for the DNS studies of temporally-evolving mixing layers. The results are found in excellent agreement with the previous experimental and DNS data. The effect of density ratio is further investigated, reflecting earlier findings of the mixing growth-rate reduction.","Arnab Chaudhuri1, Abdellah Hadjadj1, Ashwin Chinnayya1 & …Sandrine Palerm",Journal of Scientific Computing,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-010-9429-3,"DNS,Mixing layer,WENO schemes,Shock-waves"

The standard linear finite element space is employed for the spatial discretization, and the self-consistent field iteration scheme is adopted for the derived nonlinear generalized eigenvalue problem. A mesh redistribution technique is used to optimize the distribution of the mesh grids according to wavefunctions obtained from the self-consistent iterations. After the mesh redistribution, important regions in the domain such as the vicinity of the nucleus, as well as the bonding between the atoms, may be resolved more effectively. Consequently, more accurate numerical results are obtained without increasing the number of mesh grids. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness and reliability of our method for a wide range of problems. The accuracy and efficiency of the method are also illustrated through examples.","Gang Bao1,2, Guanghui Hu2 & Di Liu",Journal of Scientific Computing,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-012-9636-1,"Adaptive mesh redistribution,Harmonic map,Finite element method,Kohn-Sham equation,Density functional theory"

3305,The Big-M method with the numerical infinite M,"Linear programming is a very well known and deeply applied field of optimization theory. One of its most famous and used algorithms is the so called Simplex algorithm, independently proposed by Kantorovič and Dantzig, between the end of the 30s and the end of the 40s. Even if extremely powerful, the Simplex algorithm suffers of one initialization issue: its starting point must be a feasible basic solution of the problem to solve. To overcome it, two approaches may be used: the two-phases method and the Big-M method, both presenting positive and negative aspects. In this work we aim to propose a non-Archimedean and non-parametric variant of the Big-M method, able to overcome the drawbacks of its classical counterpart (mainly, the difficulty in setting the right value for the constant M). We realized such extension by means of the novel computational methodology proposed by Sergeyev, known as Grossone Methodology.

A main difficulty here is that the nonlinear potential for the model without slope selection is not bounded from below so the SAV approach can not be directly applied. We overcome this difficulty with a suitable splitting of the total free energy density into two parts such that the integral of the part involving the nonlinear potential becomes bounded from below so that the SAV approach can be applied. We then construct a set of linear, second-order and unconditionally energy stable schemes for the reformulated systems. These schemes lead to decoupled linear equations with constant coefficients at each time step so that they can be implemented easily and very efficiently. We present ample numerical results to demonstrate the stability and accuracy of our SAV schemes.","Qing Cheng1, Jie Shen

These properties of the model include positivity of solutions and stability of equilibrium points. Dynamical properties of the proposed NSFD schemes are rigorously investigated. The results show that the constructed nonstandard schemes preserve the essential properties of the continuous model for all finite step sizes. Consequently, we obtain NSFD schemes which are dynamically consistent with the continuous model. Especially, the constructed NSFD schemes become exact finite difference ones in some special cases. Besides, some numerical simulations are performed to validate the theoretical results as well as the advantages of the proposed NSFD schemes. The numerical simulations also indicate that the NSFD schemes are effective and appropriate to solve the continuous model. Meanwhile, the standard finite difference schemes such as the Euler scheme, the second order and fourth order Runge–Kutta schemes can generate numerical solutions that are completely different from the solutions of the continuous model and therefore, they fail to correctly reflect the correct behavior of the continuous model.",Manh Tuan Hoang1 & Oluwaseun Francis Egbelowo,ANNALI DELL'UNIVERSITA' DI FERRARA,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11565-020-00338-2,"Logistics model,Positivity,Stability,Nonstandard finite difference schemes,Exact finite difference schemes"

Such high Mach numbers occur in many settings in astrophysical flows, so it is important to develop a scheme that can simulate at these Mach numbers.

3310,Numerical Modeling of the Collisions of Spheroidal Galaxies: Mass Loss Efficiency by Baryon Components,"AbstractThe dynamics of the collision of two spheroidal galaxies, each of which consists of stellar and gas components inside a live massive dark halo, is considered in detail based on numerical simulations. Dark matter and stars are collisionless components, so their dynamics is modeled by the system of N body particles, and the gas component is described by the equations of gas dynamics. The calculation of gravitational forces is based on the direct summation method of the gravitational contribution from each particle, which provides the highest possible accuracy. We vary the impact parameter, the initial collision velocity, the masses of the three components for each model of the galaxies in order to estimate the relative fractions of the masses that are lost by both galaxies as a result of close interactions, as well as the masses of the gas and stars that are exchanged between the two galaxies during the scattering process. Estimating this exchanged mass of gas requires a Lagrangian approach to simulate gas dynamics, and the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method tracks the trajectory of each smoothed particle. There are two regions of parameters that separate the merging of two objects into one (large merging) and the case of scattering, when both gravitating systems move away from each other after interaction. The collisionless components (dark matter + stars) in the interaction of approximately the same galaxies lose their maximum mass at parameters close to the boundary between merging and scattering. If the initial masses of colliding galaxies differ greatly then the lost fraction of the mass is large for a low-mass object and small for a massive galaxy. The formation of global shock waves in colliding systems is a key factor determining the efficiency of sweeping gas from the gravitational potential well. The efficiency of the stellar-component transition from one object to another is negligible. Gas exchange can exceed 10 percent of the mass for a certain range of values of the impact parameter and the initial collision velocity.",A. V. Titov1 & A. V.

We also give numerical examples of these (when they appear to be stable) and of “unbounded trait mean differential” solutions. Further, we provide numerical evidence of bistability and hysteresis for this system, modeling an initially confined population that colonizes new territory when some biotic or abiotic conditions change, and remains in its enlarged range even when conditions change back.

3316,On the Patch Antennas Radiation Numerical Modeling with Boundary Integral Equation Method,"AbstractA mathematical model in which the antenna radiation problem is considered as the scattering problem of the incident field created by the excitation source (antenna port) on the antenna patches is developed. The problem is reduced to a hyper singular integral equation for surface currents. The solution of this integral equation (surface currents) contains also a singularity near the antenna excitation points. These surface currents are presented as the sum of an analytically extracted term, which contains the main singularity, and of unknown additional currents.

3317,Numerical Approach of a Coupled Pressure-Saturation Model Describing Oil-Water Flow in Porous Media,"Two-phase flow in porous media is a very active field of research, due to its important applications in groundwater pollution, \({\text {CO}}_2\) sequestration, or oil and gas production from petroleum reservoirs, just to name a few of them. Fractional flow equations, which make use of Darcy’s law, for describing the movement of two immiscible fluids in a porous medium, are among the most relevant mathematical models in reservoir simulation. This work aims to solve a fractional flow model formed by an elliptic equation, representing the spatial distribution of the pressure, and a hyperbolic equation describing the space-time evolution of water saturation. The numerical solution of the elliptic part is obtained using a finite-element (FE) scheme, while the hyperbolic equation is solved by means of two different numerical approaches, both in the finite-volume (FV) framework. One is based on a monotonic upstream-centered scheme for conservation laws (MUSCL)-Hancock scheme, whereas the other makes use of a weighted essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) reconstruction. In both cases, a first-order centered (FORCE)-\(\alpha\) numerical scheme is applied for intercell flux reconstruction, which constitutes a new contribution in the field of fractional flow models describing oil-water movement. A relevant feature of this work is the study of the effect of the parameter \(\alpha\) on the numerical solution of the models considered. We also show that, in the FORCE-\(\alpha\) method, when the parameter \(\alpha\) increases, the errors diminish and the order of accuracy is more properly attained, as verified using a manufactured solution technique.","Paula Luna1 & Arturo Hidalgo

3318,Numerical Study of Hydrothermal Wave Suppression in Thermocapillary Flow Using a Predictive Control Method,"Hydrothermal waves in flows driven by thermocapillary and buoyancy effects are suppressed by applying a predictive control method. Hydrothermal waves arise in the manufacturing of crystals, including the “open boat” crystal growth process, and lead to undesirable impurities in crystals. The open boat process is modeled using the two-dimensional unsteady incompressible Navier–Stokes equations under the Boussinesq approximation and the linear approximation of the surface thermocapillary force. The flow is controlled by a spatially and temporally varying heat flux density through the free surface. The heat flux density is determined by a conjugate gradient optimization algorithm. The gradient of the objective function with respect to the heat flux density is found by solving adjoint equations derived from the Navier–Stokes ones in the Boussinesq approximation. Special attention is given to heat flux density distributions over small free-surface areas and to the maximum admissible heat flux density.",F. H.

It consists in determining the air velocity and pressure on the artificial boundaries of the bronchial tree. This data completion problem is one of the highly ill-posed problems in the Hadamard sense (Hadamard in Lectures on Cauchy’s problem in linear partial differential equations. Dover, New York, 1953). This gives great importance to its numerical resolution and in particular to carry out stable numerical approaches, mostly in the case of noisy data. The main idea of this work is to extend some regularizing, stable and fast iterative algorithms for solving this problem based on the domain decomposition approach (Chakib et al. in Inverse Prob 35(1):015008, 2018). We discuss the efficiency and the feasibility of the proposed approach through some numerical tests performed using different domain decomposition algorithms.

If the medium is random, then \(\lambda \) is a random variable, and the time asymptotics of the average number of particles (over medium realizations) can be estimated in some approximation by averaging the exponent with respect to the distribution of \(\lambda \). Assuming that this distribution is Gaussian, an asymptotic “superexponential” estimate for the average flux expressed by an exponential with the exponent \(t{\text{E}}\lambda + {{t}^{2}}{\text{D}}\lambda {\text{/}}2\) can be obtained in this way. To verify this estimate in a numerical experiment, a procedure is developed for computing the probabilistic moments of \(\lambda \) based on randomizations of Fourier approximations of special nonlinear functionals.

A distinctive feature of the method is that it has a zero leading error term. As a result, the method is automatically adjusted to any redundant (extraordinary) smoothness of the solutions to be found. The method enriches practice with a new computational tool capable of inheriting, in discretized form, both differential and spectral characteristics of the operator of the problem under study. This underlies the construction of a numerical solution of guaranteed quality (accuracy) if the elliptic problem under study has a sufficiently smooth (e.g., \({{C}^{\infty }}\)-smooth) solution. The result obtained is of fundamental importance, since, in the case of \({{C}^{\infty }}\)-smooth solutions, the solution is constructed with an absolutely sharp exponential error estimate. The sharpness of the estimate is caused by the fact that the Aleksandrov \(m\)-width of the compact set of \({{C}^{\infty }}\)-smooth functions, which contains the exact solution of the problem, is asymptotically represented in the form of an exponential function decaying to zero (with growing integer parameter \(m).\)",V.

3352,Numerical Simulation of a Weakly Nonlinear Model for Water Waves with Viscosity,"The potential flow equations which govern the free-surface motion of an ideal fluid (the water wave problem) are notoriously difficult to solve for a number of reasons. First, they are a classical free-boundary problem where the domain shape is one of the unknowns to be found. Additionally, they are strongly nonlinear (with derivatives appearing in the nonlinearity) without a natural dissipation mechanism so that spurious high-frequency modes are not damped. In this contribution we address the latter of these difficulties using a surface formulation (which addresses the former complication) supplemented with physically-motivated viscous effects recently derived by Dias et al. (Phys. Lett. A 372:1297–1302, 2008). The novelty of our approach is to derive a weakly nonlinear model from the surface formulation of Zakharov (J. Appl. Mech. Tech. Phys. 9:190–194, 1968) and Craig and Sulem (J. Comput. Phys. 108:73–83, 1993), complemented with the viscous effects mentioned above.

The approach is motivated by quasi-local numerical effective forward models that are provably reliable beyond periodicity assumptions and scale separation. The goal of this work is to show that an identification of the matrix representation related to these effective models is possible. On the one hand, this provides a reasonable surrogate in cases where a direct reconstruction is unfeasible due to a mismatch between the coarse data scale and the microscopic quantities to be reconstructed. On the other hand, the approach allows us to investigate the requirement for a certain non-locality in the context of numerical homogenization.

3363,Numerical method for simulating rarefaction shocks in the approximation of phase-flip hydrodynamics,"A finite-difference algorithm is proposed for numerical modeling of hydrodynamic flows with rarefaction shocks, in which the fluid undergoes a jump-like liquid-gas phase transition. This new type of flow discontinuity, unexplored so far in computational fluid dynamics, arises in the approximation of phase-flip (PF) hydrodynamics, where a highly dynamic fluid is allowed to reach the innermost limit of metastability at the spinodal, upon which an instantaneous relaxation to the full phase equilibrium (EQ) is assumed. A new element in the proposed method is artificial kinetics of the phase transition, represented by an artificial relaxation term in the energy equation for a “hidden” component of the internal energy, temporarily withdrawn from the fluid at the moment of the PF transition. When combined with an appropriate variant of artificial viscosity in the Lagrangian framework, the latter ensures convergence to exact discontinuous solutions, which is demonstrated with several test cases.",M.

3364,High Order A-stable Numerical Methods for Stiff Problems,"Stiff problems pose special computational difficulties because explicit methods cannot solve these problems without severe limitations on the stepsize. This idea is illustrated using a contrived linear test problem and a discretized diffusion problem. Even though the Euler method can solve these problems if the stepsize is small enough, there is no such limitation for the implicit Euler method. To obtain high order A-stable methods, it is traditional to turn to Runge–Kutta methods or to linear multistep methods. Each of these has limitations of one sort or another and we consider, as a middle ground, the use of general linear (or multivalue multistage) methods. Methods possessing the property of inherent Runge–Kutta stability are identified as promising methods within this large class, and an example of one of these methods is discussed. The method in question, even though it has four stages, out-performs the implicit Euler method if sufficient accuracy is required, because of its higher order",J. C.

3365,Regularized Equations for Numerical Simulation of Flows of Homogeneous Binary Mixtures of Viscous Compressible Gases,"AbstractRegularized equations for binary mixtures of viscous compressible gases (in the absence of chemical reactions) are considered. Two new simpler systems of equations are constructed for the case of a homogeneous mixture, when the velocities and temperatures of the components coincide. In the case of moderately rarefied gases, such a system is obtained by aggregating previously derived general equations for binary mixtures of polyatomic gases. In the case of relatively dense gases, the regularizing terms in these equations are subjected to a further substantial modification. For both cases, balance equations for the total mass, kinetic, and internal energy and new balance equations for total entropy are derived from the constructed equations; additionally, the entropy production is proved to be nonnegative. As an example of successful use of the new equations, the two-dimensional Rayleigh–Taylor instability of relatively dense gas mixtures is numerically simulated in a wide range of Atwood numbers.","T.

Since it treats the given data naturally, it has a lot of merits that the finite element method does not have.

This paper examines whether this conjecture is true by a numerical experiment. From the experiment, it is observed that the precision of the natural neighbor interpolation is slightly worse than that of the finite element method. This paper discusses the reason why, and concludes that it is caused by an unwanted property of natural neighbor interpolants, which is called the suspension bridge effect in this paper.",Hisamoto Hiyoshi,Japan Journal of Industrial and Applied Mathematics,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03167440,"natural neighbor interpolation,finite element method,spatial interpolation,function approximation,Voronoi diagram"

Such a configuration requires a model with very good dispersive properties, because of the high-order harmonics generated by topography-induced nonlinear interactions. We thus depart from the aforementioned work and choose to use a new Green–Naghdi system with improved frequency dispersion characteristics. The absence of dry areas also allows us to improve the treatment of the hyperbolic part of the equations. This leads to very satisfying results for the demanding benchmarks under consideration.","F.

This framework is based on some results about positive semidefinite matrix completion, and it can be embodied in two different ways. One is by a conversion of a given sparse SDP having a large scale positive semidefinite matrix variable into an SDP having multiple but smaller positive semidefinite matrix variables. The other is by incorporating a positive definite matrix completion itself in a primal-dual interior-point method. The current article presents the details of their implementations. We introduce new techniques to deal with the sparsity through a clique tree in the former method and through new computational formulae in the latter one.

The coefficients of the elliptic part of the equation depend on the derivatives of the solution and satisfy the conditions providing strong monotonicity and Lipschitz-continuity of the corresponding operator. The equation is approximated by two finite-difference schemes: implicit and fractional step scheme. The stability of these finite difference schemes is proved and accuracy estimates are obtained under the condition of sufficient smoothness of the input data and the solution of the differential problem. A number of iterative methods for implementing the constructed nonlinear mesh problems are analyzed. The convergence and convergence rate of the iterative methods are substantiated. The results of numerical experiments confirming the theoretical conclusions are presented.,"A. V. Lapin1,2 & K. O.

In contrast to the axisymmetric approximation, the problem is formulated so as to determine the effect of the backflow on the upstream region and the thruster walls, which are of finite size. The numerical method is a generalization of rarefied gas numerical methods to the case when the force field is not specified analytically. The method takes into account the delta-function character of the boundary ion distribution function and the considerable difference between the velocity scales of ions and neutral atoms, which transform into each other.

3390,Numerical integration of positive linear differential-algebraic systems,"In the simulation of dynamical processes in economy, social sciences, biology or chemistry, the analyzed values often represent non-negative quantities like the amount of goods or individuals or the density of a chemical or biological species. Such systems are typically described by positive ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that have a non-negative solution for every non-negative initial value. Besides positivity, these processes often are subject to algebraic constraints that result from conservation laws, limitation of resources, or balance conditions and thus the models are differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). In this work, we present conditions under which both these properties, the positivity as well as the algebraic constraints, are preserved in the numerical simulation by Runge–Kutta or multistep discretization methods. Using a decomposition approach, we separate the dynamic and the algebraic equations of a given linear, positive DAE to give positivity preserving conditions for each part separately. For the dynamic part, we generalize the results for positive ODEs to DAEs using the solution representation via Drazin inverses. For the algebraic part, we use the consistency conditions of the discretization method to derive conditions under which this part of the approximation overestimates the exact solution and thus is non-negative. We analyze these conditions for some common Runge–Kutta and multistep methods and observe that for index-1 systems and stiffly accurate Runge–Kutta methods, positivity is conditionally preserved under similar conditions as for ODEs. For higher index problems, however, none of the common methods is suitable.",A. K. Baum1 & V.

In order to avoid complex coefficients which arise inevitably in the equations obtained by a direct decoupling, we decouple not the exact Newton update equation but a suitable approximation. The resulting solution scheme is shown to possess fast linear convergence and consists of several steps with same structure as implicit Euler steps. We construct concrete realizations for order one to three and give numerical evidence that the required computing time is reduced significantly compared to assembling and solving the complete coupled system by Newton’s method.","Thomas Richter1, Andreas Springer2 & Boris Vexler",Numerische Mathematik,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-012-0511-7,"65M99,65M60,65F10"

Such equation is an effective model to describe a variety of phenomena in physics. The analytic and approximate solutions of FS-HE in the absence and presence of dispersive terms have been described by applying the reproducing kernel Hilbert space method (RKHSM). The benefit of the proposed method is its ability to get the approximate solution of the FS-HE easily and quickly. The current approach utilizes reproducing kernel theory, some valuable Hilbert spaces, and a normal basis. The theoretical applicability of the RKHSM is demonstrated by providing the convergence analysis. By testing some examples, we demonstrated the potentiality, validity, and effectiveness of the RKHSM.

We test the performance of the method on the generalized Burgers–Huxley and Burgers–Fisher equations, and one- and two-dimensional coupled Burgers equations. To compare the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme, we computed \(L_{\infty }\), \(L_{2}\), and root mean square (RMS) error norms.

The nonlinear partial differential equations have been modified to ordinary differential equations though traveling wave parameter \(\xi = a_{1} x + b_{1} y + c_{1} z + Ut\). In this inspect, a collection of accurate solutions to unsteady 3D flow with MHD in porous medium are acquired. The results display that velocity component and other parameters take a polynomial function or exponential form when traveling wave solution is accepted and analyzed in such liquid stream frameworks. In special cases, the solution of MHD Newtonian fluid with porous can be gotten by putting \(\beta\) and \(\beta_{1} \to 0\) and further the solutions of MHD Jeffery nanofluid with and without porous medium can be achieved by setting \(M \to 0\) in the general solution.

Since many subsets of the sphere can be subdivided efficiently into spherical triangles, the problem reduces to computing quadrature formulas for integration on spherical triangles.

This result includes the two barycentric forms of rational interpolation as special cases. Our analysis further reveals that the stability of the second barycentric form depends on the Lebesgue constant associated with the interpolation nodes, which typically grows with n, whereas the stability of the first barycentric form depends on a similar, but different quantity, that can be bounded in terms of the mesh ratio, regardless of n.

A rigorous formulation and justification for the extended Hopf–Lax formula of(Chow et al., 2017, arxiv.org/abs/1704.02524) is provided together with novel theoretical and practical discussions including useful recommendations. By using the method of characteristics, the solutions of some problem classes under convexity/concavity conditions on Hamiltonians (in particular, the solutions of Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations in optimal control problems) are evaluated separately at different initial positions. This allows for the avoidance of the curse of dimensionality, as well as for choosing arbitrary computational regions. The corresponding feedback control strategies are obtained at selected positions without approximating the partial derivatives of the solutions. The results of numerical simulations demonstrate the high potential of the proposed techniques. It is also pointed out that, despite the indicated advantages, the related approaches still have a limited range of applicability, and their extensions to Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equations in zero-sum two-player differential games are currently developed only for sufficiently narrow classes of control systems.

More precisely, we treat the space-periodic case in three space dimensions and consider a full discretization in which the classical Crank–Nicolson method (θ-method with \(\theta =1/2\)) is used to discretize the time variable. In contrast, in the space variables, we consider finite elements. The convective term is discretized in several implicit, semi-implicit, and explicit ways. In particular, we focus on proving (possibly conditional) convergence of the discrete solutions toward weak solutions (satisfying a precise local energy balance) without extra regularity assumptions on the limit problem. We do not prove orders of convergence, but our analysis identifies some numerical schemes, providing alternate proofs of the existence of “physically relevant” solutions in three space dimensions.","Luigi C.

3425,Computational Approaches and Analysis for a Spatio-Structural-Temporal Invasive Carcinoma Model,"Spatio-temporal models have long been used to describe biological systems of cancer, but it has not been until very recently that increased attention has been paid to structural dynamics of the interaction between cancer populations and the molecular mechanisms associated with local invasion. One system that is of particular interest is that of the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) wherein uPA binds uPA receptors on the cancer cell surface, allowing plasminogen to be cleaved into plasmin, which degrades the extracellular matrix and this way leads to enhanced cancer cell migration. In this paper, we develop a novel numerical approach and associated analysis for spatio-structuro-temporal modelling of the uPA system for up to two-spatial and two-structural dimensions. This is accompanied by analytical exploration of the numerical techniques used in simulating this system, with special consideration being given to the proof of stability within numerical regimes encapsulating a central differences approach to approximating numerical gradients. The stability analysis performed here reveals instabilities induced by the coupling of the structural binding and proliferative processes. The numerical results expound how the uPA system aids the tumour in invading the local stroma, whilst the inhibitor to this system may impede this behaviour and encourage a more sporadic pattern of invasion.","Arran Hodgkinson1, Mark A.

3426,The Fshape Framework for the Variability Analysis of Functional Shapes,"This article introduces a full mathematical and numerical framework for treating functional shapes (or fshapes) following the landmarks of shape spaces and shape analysis. Functional shapes can be described as signal functions supported on varying geometrical supports. Analyzing variability of fshapes’ ensembles requires the modeling and quantification of joint variations in geometry and signal, which have been treated separately in previous approaches. Instead, building on the ideas of shape spaces for purely geometrical objects, we propose the extended concept of fshape bundles and define Riemannian metrics for fshape metamorphoses to model geometric-functional transformations within these bundles. We also generalize previous works on data attachment terms based on the notion of varifolds and demonstrate the utility of these distances. Based on these, we propose variational formulations of the atlas estimation problem on populations of fshapes and prove existence of solutions for the different models. The second part of the article examines thoroughly the numerical implementation of the tangential simplified metamorphosis model by detailing discrete expressions for the metrics and gradients and proposing an optimization scheme for the atlas estimation problem. We present a few results of the methodology on a synthetic dataset as well as on a population of retinal membranes with thickness maps.","B. Charlier1, N. Charon2 & A.

Up to now, about 1900 exoplanets were discovered. To better understand the dynamics of these exoplanets, a study with respect to possible collisions of the planet with the central star is shown here. We present an expanded model in a small parameter that takes into account up to the fifth order to analyze the effect of this potential in the orbital elements of the extrasolar planet. Numerical simulations were also performed using the N-body simulations, using the software Mercury, to compare the results with the ones obtained by the analytical model. The numerical simulations are presented in two stages: one considering the celestial bodies as point masses and the other one taking into account their dimensions. This analysis showed that the planet collided with the central star in the moment of the first inversion for orbits with high inclinations in various situations. The results of the simulations of the equations developed in this study are consistent with the N-body numerical simulations. We analyze also the flip of the inclination taking into account the coupling of the perturbations of the third body, effect due to the precession of periastron and the tide effect. In general, we find that such perturbations combined delay the time of first inversion, but do not keep the planet in a prograde or retrograde orbit.","J. P. S. Carvalho1, R. Vilhena de Moraes2, A.

Through weakly nonlinear analysis and direct numerical simulation of an averaged model, it is shown that this bifurcation is subcritical for typical parameter values, leading to hysteresis in the transition to the oscillatory state: there may thus be undesirable large-amplitude oscillations in the output voltages, even when q is below the linear stability threshold value q

The theory of Generalized Locally Toeplitz sequences allows to compute the spectral symbol function \(\omega \) associated to the discrete matrix \(\mathscr {L}\,^{(n)}\). Inspired by a recent work by T. J. R. Hughes and coauthors, we prove that the symbol \(\omega \) can measure, asymptotically, the maximum spectral relative error \(\mathscr {E}\ge 0\). It measures how the scheme is far from a good relative approximation of the whole spectrum of \(\mathscr {L}\), and it suggests a suitable (possibly non-uniform) grid such that, if coupled to an increasing refinement of the order of accuracy of the scheme, guarantees \(\mathscr {E}=0\).","Davide Bianchi

In the numerical approach it is used the quaternion to represent the attitude. This numerical approach can be applied for any kind of satellite. The analytical approach is applied directly for a spin-stabilized satellite and the equations of motion are described in terms of the spin velocity, spin axis right ascension and declination angles. An analytical solution of these equations is presented and valid for one orbit period. Applications are developed considering the Brazilian spin-stabilized satellites SCD1 and SCD2.

3439,On numerical implementations of a new iterative method with boundary condition splitting for solving the nonstationary stokes problem in a strip with periodicity condition,"Based on finite-difference approximations in time and a bilinear finite-element approximation in spatial variables, numerical implementations of a new iterative method with boundary condition splitting are constructed for solving the Dirichlet initial-boundary value problem for the nonstationary Stokes system. The problem is considered in a strip with a periodicity condition along it. At each iteration step of the method, the original problem splits into two much simpler boundary value problems that can be stably numerically approximated. As a result, this approach can be used to construct new effective and stable numerical methods for solving the nonstationary Stokes problem. The velocity and pressure are approximated by identical bilinear finite elements, and there is no need to satisfy the well-known difficult-to-verify Ladyzhenskaya-Brezzi-Babuska condition, as is usually required when the problem is discretized as a whole. Numerical iterative methods are constructed that are first- and second-order accurate in time and second-order accurate in space in the max norm for both velocity and pressure. The numerical methods have fairly high convergence rates corresponding to those of the original iterative method at the differential level (the error decreases approximately 7 times per iteration step). Numerical results are presented that illustrate the capabilities of the methods developed.",M. B.

3440,Numerical range of operators acting on Banach spaces,The aim of the paper is to propose a definition of numerical range of an operator on reflexive Banach spaces. Under this definition the numerical range will possess the basic properties of a canonical numerical range. We will determine necessary and sufficient conditions under which the numerical range of a composition operator on a weighted Hardy space is closed. We will also give some necessary conditions to show that when the closure of the numerical range of a composition operator on a small weighted Hardy space has zero.,Khadijeh Jahedi1 & Bahmann Yousefi,Czechoslovak Mathematical Journal,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10587-012-0024-7,"numerical range,weighted Hardy space,compact operator,composition operator"
3441,Numerical Simulation of Convergence of Nonspherical Shock Waves in a Cavitation Bubble,"An efficient numerical technique is developed for calculation of radially convergent shock waves arising inside an axially symmetric cavitation bubble during its collapse in a quiescent liquid. It allows one to consider the case in which the bubble remains nearly spherical at the end of its collapse and the shock wave significantly deviate from the spherical one only in a small central region. Motion of liquid and vapor is governed by the equations of gas dynamics. Heat conductivity of liquid and vapor as well as evaporation and codensation on the bubble surface are taken into account, wide-range equations of state are applied. The technique is based on a TVD-modification of the Godunov method, developed by the authors. Numerical convergence of the technique with refining the computational grid along the radial and angular coordinates is illustrated using a problem of collapse of a cavitation bubble in tetradecane. Resolution of non-sphericity of the convergent shock waves in the bubble is taken as a criterion of the numerical convergence. A case of collapse of a bubble is considered in which the radius of the bubble is initially 0.5 mm and the bubble is slightly prolate along the axis of symmetry. The liquid pressure and temperature are 60 bar and 663.15 K. The vapor in the bubble at the beginning of collapse is at the state of saturation at a temperature of the surrounding liquid with a pressure of 10.4 bar.",A. A. Aganin1 & T. F.

Comput. 79:1427–1472, 2010). This Riemann solver is based on a suitable decomposition of a Roe matrix (see Toumi in J. Comput.

The corresponding first order numerical scheme, which is called IFCP (Intermediate Field Capturing Parabola) is linearly L

3445,A Nonlocal Model for Contact Attraction and Repulsion in Heterogeneous Cell Populations,"Instructing others to move is fundamental for many populations, whether animal or cellular. In many instances, these commands are transmitted by contact, such that an instruction is relayed directly (e.g. by touch) from signaller to receiver: for cells, this can occur via receptor–ligand mediated interactions at their membranes, potentially at a distance if a cell extends long filopodia. Given that commands ranging from attractive to repelling can be transmitted over variable distances and between cells of the same (homotypic) or different (heterotypic) type, these mechanisms can clearly have a significant impact on the organisation of a tissue. In this paper, we extend a system of nonlocal partial differential equations (integrodifferential equations) to provide a general modelling framework to explore these processes, performing linear stability and numerical analyses to reveal its capacity to trigger the self-organisation of tissues. We demonstrate the potential of the framework via two illustrative applications: the contact-mediated dispersal of neural crest populations and the self-organisation of pigmentation patterns in zebrafish.","K.

Therefore, the research on magnetic force field enhancement has been becoming a popular subject recent years. Many experimental methods have been designed and applied to enhance magnetic force field, however those methods took higher costs and longer time to set up real installations. A numerical optimization method was developed, which used only superconducting coils to calculate a magnetic force field and maximize it. In the method, the magnetic flux densityB, the magnetic field gradient gradB and the magnetic force field grad(B2/2), as objective functions respectively, were maximized with constraints of the total volumes of coils and theB-J characteristics of superconductors. By comparing the numerical optimization results with theoretical values for single coil, we found that they are in good agreement. Also, in comparison with the results obtained by random models for double coils, those by optimal models were better. Moreover, the maximal magnetic force field was higher remarkably than that generated by the previous optimal model in NIMS.",Xiaojun Liu1 & Tsukasa Kiyoshi,Japan Journal of Industrial and Applied Mathematics,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03167594,"optimization,FEM,magnetic force field,superconducting coil"

Lindau and W. Lauterborn, AIP Conf. Proc. 524, 385 (2000)]. Those data are the shock wave pressure maxima at a number of points in the vicinity of the bubble at different distances from the bubble center. They were derived in the case the initial bubble radius is 1.92 mm, the liquid pressure is 1 bar, and the liquid temperature is \(23^{\circ}\)C. In the numerical modeling, the liquid flow and the dynamics of the vapor inside the bubble are governed by the equations of gas dynamics closed with wide-range equations of state. The model takes into account the heat conductivity, the evaporation and condensation on the bubble surface. The governing equations are solved by the Godunov method and its UNO- and TVD-modifications of increased order of accuracy with moving grids refined to the bubble surface. Discontinuous reconstruction of the numerical solutions in the vicinity of the shock wave front is applied. It is shown that the results of the numerical modeling by all the three methods with using the discontinuous reconstructions are very close to one another and well agree with the experimental data.",N.

3471,Numerical Simulation of Acoustic Waves Propagation in an “Atmosphere–Forestland–Ground” System,"Under study is the problem of numerical simulation of acoustic waves propagation in a two-dimensional inhomogeneous medium represented by the “atmosphere–forestland–ground” model. A specific feature of the simulation is the introduction into the basic equations of acoustics of a linear damping function that characterizes the energy loss of the acoustic wave with respect to afforestation. The problem is considered of interaction between the acoustic waves incident at a given angle from the atmosphere to the “forestland–ground” boundary and the seismic waves arising in the ground. The issue of the forestland influence on the levels of acoustic and seismic waves is investigated. In particular, the impact of the friction coefficient on the attenuation rate of acoustic oscillations in the forestland is estimated. The algorithm and software are developed and implemented for calculating the acoustic pressure levels in various media, by using the wave equation for the atmosphere, Euler’s gas dynamics equations for the forestland, and the elasticity equation for the ground. The results of numerical experiments are presented as instantaneous images of the wave field.","G. M. Voskoboinikova1, D. A. Karavaev1 & M. S.

3472,Numerical certification of Pareto optimality for biobjective nonlinear problems,"The solution to a biobjective optimization problem is composed of a collection of trade-off solution called the Pareto set. Based on a computer assisted proof methodology, the present work studies the question of certifying numerically that a conjectured set is close to the Pareto set. Two situations are considered. First, we analyze the case where the conjectured set is directly provided: one objective is explicitly given as a function of the other. Second, we analyze the situation where the conjectured set is parameterized: both objectives are explicitly given as functions of a parameter. In both cases, we formulate the question of verifying that the conjectured set is close to the Pareto set as a global optimization problem. These situations are illustrated on a new class of extremal problems over convex polygons in the plane. The objectives are to maximize the area and perimeter of a polygon with a fixed diameter, for a given number of sides.

The optimization procedure is done via a gradient method, while the computation of the eigenvalues themselves is done by means of an efficient meshless numerical method which allows for the computation of the eigenvalues for large numbers of domains within a reasonable time frame. The Dirichlet problem, previously studied by Oudet using a different numerical method, is also studied and we obtain similar (but improved) results for a larger number of eigenvalues. These results reveal an underlying structure to the optimizers regarding symmetry and connectedness, for instance, but also show that there are exceptions to these preventing general results from holding.","Pedro R.

To describe the dynamic behavior of the medium, the determining systems of equations of the theory of elasticity and acoustics with explicit distinguishing all layers are used. The polymeric composite material of the pipeline is described in a visco-elastic orthotropic model. An algorithm that allows estimating the volume of oil pipeline destroyed at the specified level of seismic activity and strength characteristics of the composite is proposed. A distinctive feature of the developed approach involves splitting the problem into two stages: the full wave calculation of the propagation of seismic waves from the earthquake source to the day surface and the calculation of a composite pipeline element as a complexly shaped object of anisotropic material. For the numerical calculation, the grid-characteristic method is used for hexahedral and tetrahedral computational grids.","K. A. Beklemysheva1,2, V. I. Golubev1, A. V. Vasyukov1,2 & …I. B.

Then by using a grid of scalarization parameter values, i.e., a grid of weights, a sequence of single-objective optimal control problems are solved to obtain points which are spread over the Pareto front. The technique is illustrated on problems involving tumor anti-angiogenesis and a fed-batch bioreactor, which exhibit bang–bang, singular and boundary types of optimal control.

Thereafter, the unknown functions have been approximated by Lucas polynomial while their derivatives by Fibonacci polynomials. With the help of these approximations, the nonlinear PDE transforms into a system of algebraic equations which can be solved easily. Convergence of the method has been investigated theoretically as well as numerically. Performance of the proposed method has been verified with the help of some test problems.

3481,Numerical simulation of Corti stimulated by fluid in tunnel of Corti,"In this paper, the effect of fluid in a tunnel of Corti (TC) on organ of Corti (OC) is studied. A three-dimensional OC model including basilar membrane (BM), tectorial membrane (TM), inner and outer hair cells (OHCs), and reticular lamina (RL) is established by COMSOL. An initial pressure is applied to the fluid in the TC. The frequency response of the structure is analyzed, and the displacement of the BM is achieved. The results are in good agreement with the experimental data, confirming validity of the finite element model. Based on the model, the effect of fluid in the TC on the OC is studied. The results show that, when the pressure gradient is absent in the fluid, with the increase of the initial fluid pressure, the displacement of the BM increases. However, when the initial fluid pressure increases to a certain value, the increase rate of the displacement of the BM becomes very slow. The movement of the fluid amplifies the BM movement. Furthermore, the movement of the fluid can strengthen the movement of the OHCs and the shear movement of the stereocilia, especially in the vicinity of the characteristic frequency at which the amplification effect reaches a peak. Nevertheless, a pressure gradient in the fluid affects the BM movement.","Yiqiang Chen1, Wenjuan Yao1 & Shaofeng Liu",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-017-2197-9,"tunnel of Corti (TC),organ of Corti (OC),frequency response,fluid pressure"

In this paper we consider some properties of a multivariate extension of this result to an arbitrary convex polytope. The proof is based on the use of Green formula. In doing so, we will prove an inequality recently conjectured in (Guessab and Semisalov in BIT Numerical Mathematics, 2018) about a natural multivariate version of the classical trapezoidal rule. Our proof is based on a generalization of Hammer’s inequality in a multivariate setting. It also provides a way to construct new “extended” cubature formulas, which give a reasonably good approximation to integrals in which they have been tested. We particularly pay attention to the explicit expressions of the best possible constants appearing in the error estimates for these cubatute formulas.","Allal Guessab1 & Boris Semisalov2,",Results in Mathematics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00025-018-0788-7,"Cubature,approximation,convexity,best constants,error estimates"

The resulted high order implicit difference equations were effeciently solved by the modified incomplete LU decomposition conjugate gradient scheme (MILU-CG). The effects of surface suction or blowing’s position and strength on the vortex structures in the cylinder wake, as well as on the drag and lift forces at Reynoldes number Re=100 were investigated numerically. The results show that the suction on the shoulder of the cylinder or the blowing on the rear of the cylinder can effeciently suppress the asymmetry of the vortex wake in the transverse direction and greatly reduce the lift force; the suction on the shoulder of the cylinder, when its strength is properly chosen, can reduce the drag force significantly, too.",Ling Guo-ping Professor1 & Fang Jian-wen,Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02437720,"circular cylinder with surface suction or blowing,separated vortex flow around bluff body and its control,vorticity-velocity method,preconditioned conjugate gradient method"
3488,Numerical investigation of flow over a two-dimensional square cylinder with a synthetic jet generated by a bi-frequency signal,"The flow around a square cylinder with a synthetic jet positioned at the rear surface is numerically investigated with the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) method. Instead of the typical sinusoidal wave, a bi-frequency signal is adopted to generate the synthetic jet. The bi-frequency signal consists of a basic sinusoidal wave and a high-frequency wave. Cases with various amplitudes of the high-frequency component are simulated. It is found that synthetic jets actuated by bi-frequency signals can realize better drag reduction with lower energy consumption when appropriate parameter sets are applied. A new quantity, i.e., the actuation efficiency Ae, is used to evaluate the controlling efficiency. The actuation efficiency Ae reaches its maximum of 0.266 8 when the amplitude of the superposed high-frequency signal is 7.5% of the basic signal. The vortex structures and frequency characteristics are subsequently analyzed to investigate the mechanism of the optimization of the bi-frequency signal. When the synthetic jet is actuated by a single-frequency signal with a characteristic velocity of 0.112 m/s, the wake is asymmetrical. The alternative deflection of vortex pairs and the peak at half of the excitation frequency in the power spectral density (PSD) function are detected. In the bi-frequency cases with the same characteristic velocity, the wake gradually turns to be symmetrical with the increase in the amplitude of the high-frequency component. Meanwhile, the deflection of the vortex pairs and the peak at half of the excitation frequency gradually disappear as well.","Yiran Lu1, Yuan Qu1, Jiangsheng Wang1 & …Jinjun Wang",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-022-2919-6,"synthetic jet,flow control,signal superposition,vortex dynamics"

Implementation of the boundary conditions, which reflect the continuity of the common current circuit and potential equalization at the boundaries of the polar caps, is leading to the mutual dependence of the potential distribution within the northern and southern caps and their influence on the potential distribution in the midlatitude region. The problem is solved by an iterative method with a regularizing operator which is inverted using the separation of the variables and the fast Fourier transform with respect to the azimuthal variable and the sweep method with respect to the latitudinal one.","R.

The numerical simulation is done with the parallel algorithm and the multi-viscous-fluid and turbulence (MVFT) code of the large-eddy simulation (LES). The developing process of the interface accelerated by the shock wave is reproduced by the simulations. The complex wave structures, e.g., the propagation, refraction, and reflection of the shock wave, are clearly revealed in the flows. The simulated evolving images of the interface are consistent with the experimental ones. The simulated width of the turbulent mixing zone (TMZ) and the displacements of the bubble and the spike also agree well with the experimental data. Also, the reliability and effectiveness of the MVFT in simulating the problem of interface instability are validated. The more energies are injected into the TMZ when the shock wave has a larger Mach number. Therefore, the perturbed interface develops faster.","Tao Wang

The gas pressure decreases from the hub to the tip of the blade, and it is higher at the pressure side than that at the suction side of the rotor. The turbulent kinetic energy of the gas increases toward the blade tip. The volume fraction of particles decreases as the hovering altitude increases.

Our numerical results imply that, for use with the DFP update, the Oren-Luenberger sizing factor is completely satisfactory and selective sizing is vastly superior to the alternatives of never sizing or first-iteration sizing and is slightly better than the alternative of always sizing. Numerical experimentation showed that the Oren-Luenberger sizing factor is not a satisfactory sizing factor for use with the BFGS update. Therefore, based on our newly acquired understanding of the situation, we propose a centered Oren-Luenberger sizing factor to be used with the BFGS update. Our numerical experimentation implies that selectively sizing the BFGS update with the centered Oren-Luenberger sizing factor is superior to the alternatives. These results contradict the folk axiom that sizing should be done only at the first iteration. They also show that, without sufficient sizing, DFP is vastly inferior to BFGS; however, when selectively sized, DFP is competitive with BFGS.",M. Contreras & R. A.

3503,Numerical Solution of a Two Dimensional Tumour Growth Model with Moving Boundary,"We consider a biphasic continuum model for avascular tumour growth in two spatial dimensions, in which a cell phase and a fluid phase follow conservation of mass and momentum. A limiting nutrient that follows a diffusion process controls the birth and death rate of the tumour cells. The cell volume fraction, cell velocity–fluid pressure system, and nutrient concentration are the model variables. A coupled system of a hyperbolic conservation law, a viscous fluid model, and a parabolic diffusion equation governs the dynamics of the model variables. The tumour boundary moves with the normal velocity of the outermost layer of cells, and this time-dependence is a challenge in designing and implementing a stable and fast numerical scheme. We recast the model into a form where the hyperbolic equation is defined on a fixed extended domain and retrieve the tumour boundary as the interface at which the cell volume fraction decreases below a threshold value. This procedure eliminates the need to track the tumour boundary explicitly and the computationally expensive re-meshing of the time-dependent domains. A numerical scheme based on finite volume methods for the hyperbolic conservation law, Lagrange \(\mathbb {P}_2 - \mathbb {P}_1\) Taylor-Hood finite element method for the viscous system, and mass-lumped finite element method for the parabolic equations is implemented in two spatial dimensions, and several cases are studied. We demonstrate the versatility of the numerical scheme in catering for irregular and asymmetric initial tumour geometries. When the nutrient diffusion equation is defined only in the tumour region, the model depicts growth in free suspension. On the contrary, when the nutrient diffusion equation is defined in a larger fixed domain, the model depicts tumour growth in a polymeric gel. We present numerical simulations for both cases and the results are consistent with theoretical and heuristic expectations such as early linear growth rate and preservation of radial symmetry when the boundary conditions are symmetric. The work presented here could be extended to include the effect of drug treatment of growing tumours.","Jérôme Droniou1, Jennifer A. Flegg2 & Gopikrishnan C. Remesan

A finite element discretization with the help of AFEPack is applied to the physical space, and the equations obtained are solved by the approximate Newton iterative method. Comparison of the three stochastic methods through numerical experiment on different PN junctions are given. The numerical results show that, for such a complicated nonlinear problem, the stochastic Galerkin method has no obvious advantages on efficiency except accuracy over the other two methods, and the stochastic collocation method combines the accuracy of the stochastic Galerkin method and the easy implementation of the Monte Carlo method.","Wenqi Yao1 & Tiao Lu1,",Frontiers of Mathematics in China,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11464-013-0327-5,"Stochastic partial differential equation,stochastic Galerkin method,stochastic collocation method,Monte Carlo method"
3506,Numerical solution for optimal control of the reaction-diffusion equations in cardiac electrophysiology,"The bidomain equations, a continuum approximation of cardiac tissue based on the idea of a functional syncytium, are widely accepted as one of the most complete descriptions of cardiac bioelectric activity at the tissue and organ level. Numerous studies employed bidomain simulations to investigate the formation of cardiac arrhythmias and their therapeutical treatment. They consist of a linear elliptic partial differential equation and a non-linear parabolic partial differential equation of reaction-diffusion type, where the reaction term is described by a set of ordinary differential equations. The monodomain equations, although not explicitly accounting for current flow in the extracellular domain and its feedback onto the electrical activity inside the tissue, are popular since they approximate, under many circumstances of practical interest, the bidomain equations quite well at a much lower computational expense, owing to the fact that the elliptic equation can be eliminated when assuming that conductivity tensors of intracellular and extracellular space are related to each other.Optimal control problems suggest themselves quite naturally for this important class of modelling problems and the present paper is a first attempt in this direction. Specifically, we present an optimal control formulation for the monodomain equations with an extra-cellular current, I

e
, as the control variable. I

e
 must be determined such that electrical activity in the tissue is damped in an optimal manner.The derivation of the optimality system is given and a method for its numerical realization is proposed.

The main goals of this work are to demonstrate that optimal control techniques can be employed successfully to this class of highly nonlinear models and that the influence of I

 judiciously applied can in fact serve as a successful control for the dampening of propagating wavefronts.","Chamakuri Nagaiah1, Karl Kunisch1 & Gernot Plank",Computational Optimization and Applications,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10589-009-9280-3,"Bidomain model,Reaction-diffusion equations,Ionic model,Optimal control with PDE constraints,Existence and uniqueness,FEM,Rosenbrock type methods,NCG method"

3516,"Numerical Computation of Optimal Trajectories for Coplanar, Aeroassisted Orbital Transfer","This paper is concerned with the problem of the optimal coplanaraeroassisted orbital transfer of a spacecraft from a high Earth orbitto a low Earth orbit. It is assumed that the initial and final orbits arecircular and that the gravitational field is central and is governed by theinverse square law. The whole trajectory is assumed to consist of twoimpulsive velocity changes at the begin and end of one interior atmosphericsubarc, where the vehicle is controlled via the lift coefficient.The problem is reduced to the atmospheric part of the trajectory, thusarriving at an optimal control problem with free final time and liftcoefficient as the only (bounded) control variable. For this problem,the necessary conditions of optimal control theory are derived. Applyingmultiple shooting techniques, two trajectories with different controlstructures are computed. The first trajectory is characterized by a liftcoefficient at its minimum value during the whole atmospheric pass. For thesecond trajectory, an optimal control history with a boundary subarcfollowed by a free subarc is chosen. It turns out, that this secondtrajectory satisfies the minimum principle, whereas the first one fails tosatisfy this necessary condition; nevertheless, the characteristicvelocities of the two trajectories differ only in the sixth significantdigit.In the second part of the paper, the assumption of impulsive velocitychanges is dropped. Instead, a more realistic modeling with twofinite-thrust subarcs in the nonatmospheric part of the trajectory isconsidered. The resulting optimal control problem now describes the wholemaneuver including the nonatmospheric parts. It contains as controlvariables the thrust, thrust angle, and lift coefficient. Further,the mass of the vehicle is treated as an additional state variable. For thisoptimal control problem, numerical solutions are presented.

3524,A Group of CFL-Dependent Flux-Limiters to Control the Numerical Dissipation in Multi-stage Unsteady Calculation,"In this paper, a group of CFL-dependent Piecewise-Linear flux-limiters termed as GPL-CFL limiters are proposed to control and limit the numerical dissipation in Multi-stage Unsteady high resolution schemes. These limiters satisfy the second-order TVD criterion while are subject to the Multi-stage Time-space separated Unsteady TVD criterion. The accuracy of the high resolution schemes using these limiters can be improved by properly tuning the four parameters including CFL number and other three variables contained in them. To fully illustrate the ability of GPL-CFL limiters to control dissipation, an entropy dissipation function with these limiters is defined and is proved to be monotonic with each parameter. For some endpoint values of parameters, a relatively ideal limiter named by MDF-CFL limiter is obtained in the sense of CFL-dependent minimum dissipation. In the end, the high resolution entropy-consistent schemes which are termed as HRECSIS schemes are constructed using GPL-CFL limiters and are used to compute the solutions for Burgers and Euler equations in 1D and 2D cases. Numerical results sufficiently illustrate the accuracy of HRECSIS schemes, in the context of MTU calculations, are closely related with the four parameters contained in GPL-CFL limiters and the higher resolution than their corresponding CFL-independent flux-limiters can be obtained for computed solutions when CFL number is in the range of (0, 0.5).","Jiong Ren

Due to the structure of FDDEs with non-equal multi-delay, utilizing of multi-step methods are noticeable selection. In the proposed method, the multi-step technique with respect to delays of FDDEs, is used. For this purpose we divide the main time interval [0,T] into appropriate sub intervals, then we use method of steps in each interval. In this process, first the terms of involving delays are replaced with initial condition and its derivatives, so the fractional-order delay differential equation is reduced to a fractional-order differential equation, Afterward GDTM is applied to convert the fractional-order differential equation to a system of recurrence relations. The numerical solution is achieved with inverse transformation. Compared to the current numerical methods, the proposed algorithm seems to be an effective and convenient technique for solving various type of FDDEs.

3529,Adaptive Numerical Approach for Optimal Control of a Single Train,"This paper considers the optimal control problem of a single train, which is formulated as an optimal control problem of nonlinear systems with switching controller. The switching sequence and the switching time are decision variables to be chosen optimally. Generally speaking, it is very difficult to solve this problem analytically due to its nonlinear nature, the complexity of the controller, and the existence of system state and control input constraints. To obtain the numerical solution, by introducing binary functions for every value of the control input, relaxing the binary functions, and imposing a penalty function on the relaxation, the problem is transformed into a parameter optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved by using any gradient-based numerical approach. Then, the authors propose an adaptive numerical approach to solve this problem. Convergence results indicate that any optimal solution of the parameter optimization problem is also an optimal solution of the original problem. Finally, an optimal control problem of a single train illustrates that the adaptive numerical approach proposed by us is less time-consuming and obtains a better cost function value than the existing approaches.","Xiang Wu1,2, Kanjian Zhang3,4 & Ming Cheng",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-018-7277-7,"Adaptive numerical approach,nonlinear system,optimal control,switching controller,train control"

The simulation results demonstrate that angiostatin has an obvious impact on the morphology, growth rate, and the number of branches of microvascular network inside and outside the metastatic tumor, and angiostatin has the capacity to regulate and inhibit the formation of new blood vessels. Heterogeneous blood perfusion, widespread interstitial hypertension, and low convection within the metastatic tumor have obviously improved under the inhibitory effect of angiostatin, which are consistent with physiological observed facts.

3535,Numerical Simulation of Cellular Flame Propagation in Narrow Gaps,"AbstractBased on the numerical solution of the equations of a multicomponent reacting gas in the approximation of small Mach numbers, a computational model of the combustion of a premixed mixture in a narrow gap between parallel plates is presented. A block-by-block adaptive mesh refinement algorithm is used, which makes it possible to achieve a high resolution in areas of sharp changes in the flow characteristics, primarily near the flame front. A detailed kinetic mechanism for the combustion of methane mixed with air is used. The simulations are carried out using the ParTCS-3D software package developed by the authors on a K-100 supercomputer installed at Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics, Russian Academy of Sciences (KIAM RAS). The effectiveness of the parallel implementation of the developed numerical technique is demonstrated. Parametric simulations of the combustion of a stoichiometric methane-air mixture are carried out; the distance between the plates varies between 3–6 mm. The appearance of instability of the propagating flame, which is expressed in the development of cells at its front, is shown. With a small gap width, flame extinction near the ignition source is demonstrated. The calculated dependence of the apparent flame propagation velocity on the gap width, which indicates faster flame propagation in a wide gap due to the smaller influence of viscosity and heat loss, is obtained.","V.

3541,A Higher Order Numerical Implicit Method for Non-Linear Burgers’ Equation,"This paper proposes a higher order implicit numerical scheme to approximate the solution of the nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). This equation is a simplified form of Navier–Stoke’s equation also known as Burgers’ equation. It is an important nonlinear PDE which arises frequently in mathematical modeling of turbulence in fluid dynamics. In order to handle nonlinearity a nonlinear transformation is used which converts the nonlinear PDE into a linear PDE. The linear PDE is semi-discretized in space by method of lines to yield a system of ordinary differential equations in time. The resulting system of differential equations is investigated and found to be a stiff system. A system of stiff differential equations is further discretized by a low-dispersion and low-dissipation implicit Runge–Kutta method and solved by using MATLAB 8.0. The proposed scheme is unconditionally stable. Moreover it is simple, easy to implement and requires less computational time. Finally, the adaptability of the scheme is demonstrated by means of numerical computations by taking three test problems. The present implicit scheme have been compared with existing schemes in literature which shows that the proposed scheme offers more accuracy with less computational time than the numerical schemes given in Jiwari (Comput Phys Comm 183:2413–2423, 2012), Kutluay et al.

3543,"Shallow water equations: split-form, entropy stable, well-balanced, and positivity preserving numerical methods","For the first time, a general two-parameter family of entropy conservative numerical fluxes for the shallow water equations is developed and investigated. These are adapted to a varying bottom topography in a well-balanced way, i.e. preserving the lake-at-rest steady state. Furthermore, these fluxes are used to create entropy stable and well-balanced split-form semidiscretisations based on general summation-by-parts (SBP) operators, including Gauß nodes. Moreover, positivity preservation is ensured using the framework of Zhang and Shu (Proc R Soc Lond A Math Phys Eng Sci 467: 2752–2776, 2011). Therefore, the new two-parameter family of entropy conservative fluxes is enhanced by dissipation operators and investigated with respect to positivity preservation. Additionally, some known entropy stable and positive numerical fluxes are compared. Furthermore, finite volume subcells adapted to nodal SBP bases with diagonal mass matrix are used. Finally, numerical tests of the proposed schemes are performed and some conclusions are presented.","Hendrik Ranocha

3545,Comparison of Some Entropy Conservative Numerical Fluxes for the Euler Equations,"Entropy conservation and stability of numerical methods in gas dynamics have received much interest. Entropy conservative numerical fluxes can be used as ingredients in two kinds of schemes: firstly, as building blocks in the subcell flux differencing form of Fisher and Carpenter (Technical Report NASA/TM-2013-217971, NASA, 2013; J Comput Phys 252:518–557, 2013) and secondly (enhanced by dissipation) as numerical surface fluxes in finite volume like schemes. The purpose of this article is threefold. Firstly, the flux differencing theory is extended, guaranteeing high-order for general symmetric and consistent numerical fluxes and investigating entropy stability in a generalised framework of summation-by-parts operators applicable to multiple dimensions and simplex elements. Secondly, a general procedure to construct affordable entropy conservative fluxes is described explicitly and used to derive several new fluxes. Finally, robustness properties of entropy stable numerical fluxes are investigated and positivity preservation is proven for several entropy conservative fluxes enhanced with local Lax–Friedrichs type dissipation operators. All these theoretical investigations are supplemented with numerical experiments.","Hendrik Ranocha

The main idea of the last algorithm is to assign one thread within each computational node to perform the data transfer. This approach allows us to implement overlapping of useful computations and data transfer. The results show that the introducing postman threads can significantly improve the performance of an MPI/OpenMP implementation; nevertheless, for the considered class of numerical algorithms, it is more reasonable to use an MPI implementation.","K.

A Numerical Exploration,"In this article we investigate numerically the spectrum of some representative examples of discrete one-dimensional Schrödinger operators with quasi-periodic potential in terms of a perturbative constant b and the spectral parameter a. Our examples include the well-known Almost Mathieu model, other trigonometric potentials with a single quasi-periodic frequency and generalisations with two and three frequencies. We computed numerically the rotation number and the Lyapunov exponent to detect open and collapsed gaps, resonance tongues and the measure of the spectrum. We found that the case with one frequency was significantly different from the case of several frequencies because the latter has all gaps collapsed for a sufficiently large value of the perturbative constant and thus the spectrum is a single spectral band with positive Lyapunov exponent. In contrast, in the cases with one frequency considered, gaps are always dense in the spectrum, although some gaps may collapse either for a single value of the perturbative constant or for a range of values. In all cases we found that there is a curve in the (a, b)-plane which separates the regions where the Lyapunov exponent is zero in the spectrum and where it is positive. Along this curve, which is b = 2 in the Almost Mathieu case, the measure of the spectrum is zero.",Joaquim Puig1 & Carles Simó,Journal of Dynamics and Differential Equations,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10884-010-9199-5,"Quasi-periodic Schrödinger operators,Quasi-periodic cocycles and skew-products,Spectral gaps,Resonance tongues,Rotation number,Lyapunov exponent,Numerical explorations"

This modification allows taking into account Joule heating during the propagation of acoustic oscillations, generated by electromagnetic source, and is implemented by adding “thermoelastic terms” into the state equations for porous fluid and formation. Temperature change is determined by heat conduction equation. Method of constructing of corresponding finite-difference scheme in axially symmetric case is described. The results of numerical simulations are presented, which show that at low frequencies the Stoneley wave can be used to estimate formation permeability, and the fast acoustic wave can be used for this purpose at high frequencies, when the influence of Joule heating can be neglected. However, if the conductivity of porous or especially borehole fluid is high enough, then the thermoelastic wave arises due to Joule heating, whose contribution is hard to account for due to the nonlinearity of such an effect.",B.

3552,Direct numerical simulation of flow in channel with time-dependent wall geometry,"A numerical scheme is developed to extend the scope of the spectral method without solving the covariant and contravariant forms of the Navier-Stokes equations in the curvilinear coordinates. The primitive variables are represented by the Fourier series and the Chebyshev polynomials in the computational space. The time advancement is accomplished by a high-order time-splitting method, and a corresponding high-order pressure condition at the wall is introduced to reduce the splitting error. Compared with the previous pseudo-spectral scheme, in which the Navier-Stokes equations are solved in the covariant and contravariant forms, the present scheme reduces the computational cost and, at the same time, keeps the spectral accuracy. The scheme is tested in the simulations of the turbulent flow in a channel with a static streamwise wavy wall and the turbulent flow over a flexible wall undergoing the streamwise traveling wave motion. The turbulent flow over an oscillating dimple is studied with the present numerical scheme, and the periodic generation of the vortical structures is analyzed.","Ming-wei Ge

3559,Experimental analysis of local searches for sparse reflexive generalized inverses,"The well-known M-P (Moore-Penrose) pseudoinverse is used in several linear-algebra applications; for example, to compute least-squares solutions of inconsistent systems of linear equations. Irrespective of whether a given matrix is sparse, its M-P pseudoinverse can be completely dense, potentially leading to high computational burden and numerical difficulties, especially when we are dealing with high-dimensional matrices. The M-P pseudoinverse is uniquely characterized by four properties, but not all of them need to be satisfied for some applications. In this context, Fampa and Lee (Oper. Res. Lett., 46:605–610, 2018) and Xu et al. (SIAM J. Optim., to appear) propose local-search procedures to construct sparse block-structured generalized inverses that satisfy only some of the M-P properties. (Vector) 1-norm minimization is used to induce sparsity and to keep the magnitude of the entries under control, and theoretical results limit the distance between the 1-norm of the solution of the local searches and the minimum 1-norm of generalized inverses with corresponding properties. We have implemented several local-search procedures based on results presented in these two papers and make here an experimental analysis of them, considering their application to randomly generated matrices of varied dimensions, ranks, and densities. Further, we carried out a case study on a real-world data set.","Marcia Fampa1, Jon Lee

N. We take a point of view which in our opinion is somewhat moregeometric and lessalgebraic andnumerical than what has been customary in the literature, and find that this can some times yield simpler and more natural proofs, as well as yield additional insight into the situation. We first recall the standard definitions of thedual variety and theconormal scheme, introducing classical numerical invariants associated with duality. In section 2 we recall the well known duality properties these invariants have, and which was noted first byT. Urabe. In section 3 we investigate the connection between these invariants andChern classes in the singular case.

3563,A numerical method for nonlinear fractional reaction–advection–diffusion equation with piecewise fractional derivative,"This study introduces a new fractional version of the nonlinear reaction–advection–diffusion equation using a kind of piecewise fractional derivatives defined by Atangana and Araz. A hybrid approach using the Chebyshev cardinal functions and piecewise Chebyshev cardinal functions is established for finding a solution to this equation. The presented method transforms solving the generated fractional problem into finding the solution of a nonlinear algebraic system by expanding the solution of the problem in terms of the mentioned basis functions and employing the piecewise fractional derivative matrix of the piecewise Chebyshev cardinal functions (which is derived in this study). The accuracy of the constructed algorithm is checked in some illustrative examples.

3565,Numerical simulation of MHD natural convection flow in a wavy cavity filled by a hybrid Cu-Al2O3-water nanofluid with discrete heating,"We consider the combined effect of the magnetic field and heat transfer inside a square cavity containing a hybrid nanofluid (Cu-Al2O3-water). The upper and bottom walls of the cavity have a wavy shape. The temperature of the vertical walls is lower, the third part in the middle of the bottom wall is kept at a constant higher temperature, and the remaining parts of the bottom wall and the upper wall are thermally insulated. The magnetic field is applied under the angle γ, an opposite clockwise direction. For the numerical simulation, the finite element technique is employed. The ranges of the characteristics are as follows: the Rayleigh number (103 ⩽ Ra ⩽ 105), the Hartmann number (0 ⩽ Ha ⩽ 100), the nanoparticle hybrid concentration (ϕAl2o3, ϕCu = 0, 0.025, 0.05), the magnetic field orientation (0 ⩽ γ ⩽ 2π), and the Prandtl number Pr, the amplitude of wavy cavity A, and the number of waviness n are fixed at Pr = 7, A = 0.1, and n = 3, respectively. The comparison with a reported finding in the open literature is done, and the data are observed to be in very good agreement. The effects of the governing parameters on the energy transport and fluid flow parameters are studied. The results prove that the increment of the magnetic influence determines the decrease of the energy transference because the conduction motion dominates the fluid movement. When the Rayleigh number is raised, the Nusselt number is increased, too. For moderate Rayleigh numbers, the maximum ratio of the heat transfer takes place for the hybrid nanofluid and then the Cu-nanofluid, followed by the Al2O3-nanofluid. The nature of motion and energy transport parameters has been scrutinized.","C. Revnic1, T. Groşan2, M. Sheremet3 & …I.

3571,Numerical study of opposed zero-net-mass-flow jet-induced erythrocyte mechanoporation,"With the advantages of biosafety and efficiency, increasing attention has been paid to the devices for gene and macromolecular drug delivery based on mechanoporation. The transient pore formation on the cell membrane allows cargo transportation when the membrane areal strain is beyond the critical pore value and below the lysis tension threshold. Based on this principle, we propose a method to apply the proper fluid stress on cells moving in a microchannel under the action of zero-net-mass-flux (ZNMF) jets. In this study, an immersed finite element method (IFEM) is adopted to simulate the interaction between the cells and the fluid fields so as to investigate the cell movement and deformation in this mechanoporation system. To evaluate the efficiency of the cargo delivery, a pore integral is defined as the mean pore rate when the cell passes through the jet region. By analyzing the effects of the parameters, including the pressure gradient along the microchannel, the jet amplitude, and the jet frequency, on the pore integrals, a group of optimized parameters for cargo delivery efficiency are obtained. Additionally, the stability and safety of this system are analyzed in detail. These results are helpful in designing the mechanoporation devices and improving their efficiency of drug delivery.","Xinyue Liu1, Jinfang Ai1, Jun Xie1 & …Guohui Hu1,",Applied Mathematics and Mechanics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10483-022-2931-6,"drug delivery,membrane mechanoporation,zero-net-mass-flux (ZNMF) jet,immersed finite element method (IFEM)"

For example, three numerical quadrature formulas of trapezoidal type result from this approach for the case \(m=3\), and these are $$\begin{aligned} {\widehat{T}}^{(0)}_{3,n}[f]&=h\sum ^{n-1}_{j=1}f(t+jh)-\frac{\pi ^2}{3}\,g'(t)\,h^{-1} +\frac{1}{6}\,g'''(t)\,h, \quad h=\frac{T}{n},\\ {\widehat{T}}^{(1)}_{3,n}[f]&=h\sum ^n_{j=1}f(t+jh-h/2)-\pi ^2\,g'(t)\,h^{-1},\quad h=\frac{T}{n},\\ {\widehat{T}}^{(2)}_{3,n}[f]&=2h\sum ^n_{j=1}f(t+jh-h/2)- \frac{h}{2}\sum ^{2n}_{j=1}f(t+jh/2-h/4),\quad h=\frac{T}{n}. \end{aligned}$$For all m and s, we show that all of the numerical quadrature formulas \({\widehat{T}}^{(s)}_{m,n}[f]\) have spectral accuracy; that is, $$\begin{aligned} {\widehat{T}}^{(s)}_{m,n}[f]-I[f]=o(n^{-\mu })\quad \text {as}\, {n\rightarrow \infty }\quad \forall \mu >0. \end{aligned}$$We provide a numerical example involving a periodic integrand with \(m=3\) that confirms our convergence theory. We also show how the formulas \({\widehat{T}}{}^{(s)}_{3,n}[f]\) can be used in an efficient manner for solving supersingular integral equations whose kernels have a \((x-t)^{-3}\) singularity. A similar approach can be applied for all m.","Avram Sidi

3596,Numerical simulation of insect flight,"In the non-inertial coordinates attached to the model wing, the two-dimensional unsteady flow field triggered by the motion of the model wing, similar to the flapping of the insect wings, was numerically simulated. One of the advantages of our method is that it has avoided the difficulty related to the moving-boundary problem. Another advantage is that the model has three degrees of freedom and can be used to simulate arbitrary motions of a two-dimensional wing in plane only if the motion is known. Such flexibility allows us to study how insects control their flying. Our results show that there are two parameters that are possibly utilized by insects to control their flight: the phase difference between the wing translation and rotation, and the lateral amplitude of flapping along the direction perpendicular to the average flapping plane.","Cheng Mu-lin

We calculate the asymptotic approximation of the solution, around a mean flow, of this problem using an Eulerian method. By introducing the stretching matrix (deformation tensor for the geometrical optics rays) of the linearized Euler system, we deduce the geometrical spreading. This quantity is the key tool for computing the leading order term of the asymptotic expansion thanks to a conservation equation along the group velocity. The main contribution is to construct and implement a numerical scheme in the Eulerian framework for the eikonal equation and for the transport equation on the stretching matrix. We present numerical results for several test cases to study the convergence and validate our approach.","Youness Noumir1, François Dubois2,3 & Olivier Lafitte1,",Numerische Mathematik,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-013-0598-5,"35B40,35L50,65N06,76Q05"
3600,A numerical method with a control parameter for integro-differential delay equations with state-dependent bounds via generalized Mott polynomial,"In this paper, we introduce a numerical method to obtain an accurate approximate solution of the integro-differential delay equations with state-dependent bounds. The method is based basically on the generalized Mott polynomial with the parameter-\(\beta\), Chebyshev–Lobatto collocation points and matrix structures. These matrices are gathered under a unique matrix equation and then solved algebraically, which produce the desired solution. We discuss the behavior of the solutions, controlling their parameterized form via \(\beta\) and so we monitor the effectiveness of the method. We improve the obtained solutions by employing the Mott-residual error estimation. In addition to comparing the results in tables, we also illustrate the solutions in figures, which are made up of the phase plane, logarithmic and standard scales. All results indicate that the present method is simple-structured, reliable and straightforward to write a computer program module on any mathematical software.","Ömür Kıvanç Kürkçü

In the present paper, a new method for calculating the intensity of thermal-motion-induced forbidden reflections is proposed. It includes two steps: simulation of the temporary atomic displacements with the help of the ab initio molecular dynamics followed by quantum-mechanical calculations of the resonant scattering amplitude for various configurations. This technique is applied to the calculation of the 600 reflection thermal behavior in Ge and gives an adequate quantitative fitting of experimental data. The proposed simulation method of the thermal-motion-induced forbidden reflections is suitable for any crystal structure and promises to explain many results obtained up to now in synchrotrons.","A.

3602,Numerical Methods for Solving Space Fractional Partial Differential Equations Using Hadamard Finite-Part Integral Approach,"We introduce a novel numerical method for solving two-sided space fractional partial differential equations in two-dimensional case. The approximation of the space fractional Riemann–Liouville derivative is based on the approximation of the Hadamard finite-part integral which has the convergence order \(O(h^{3- \alpha })\), where h is the space step size and \(\alpha \in (1, 2)\) is the order of Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative. Based on this scheme, we introduce a shifted finite difference method for solving space fractional partial differential equations. We obtained the error estimates with the convergence orders \(O(\tau +h^{3-\alpha }+ h^{\beta })\), where \(\tau\) is the time step size and \(\beta >0\) is a parameter which measures the smoothness of the fractional derivatives of the solution of the equation. Unlike the numerical methods for solving space fractional partial differential equations constructed using the standard shifted Grünwald–Letnikov formula or higher order Lubich’s methods which require the solution of the equation to satisfy the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition to get the first-order convergence, the numerical method for solving the space fractional partial differential equation constructed using the Hadamard finite-part integral approach does not require the solution of the equation to satisfy the Dirichlet homogeneous boundary condition. Numerical results show that the experimentally determined convergence order obtained using the Hadamard finite-part integral approach for solving the space fractional partial differential equation with non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions is indeed higher than the convergence order obtained using the numerical methods constructed with the standard shifted Grünwald–Letnikov formula or Lubich’s higher order approximation schemes.","Yanyong Wang1, Yubin Yan2 & Ye Hu",Communications on Applied Mathematics and Computation,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42967-019-00036-7,"Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative,Space fractional partial differential equation,Error estimates"

3604,A remedy for the failure of the numerical steepest descent method on a class of oscillatory integrals,"In this paper we demonstrate that the numerical method of steepest descent fails when applied in a straight forward fashion to the most commonly occurring highly oscillatory integrals in scattering theory. Through a polar change of variables, however, the integral can be reformulated so that it can be solved efficiently using a combination of oscillatory integration techniques and classical quadrature. The approach is described in detail and demonstrated numerically with some oscillatory integral examples. The numerical examples demonstrate that our approach avoids the failure in some special cases, such as in an acoustic scattering model oscillatory integral with observation point located in the illuminated region. This paves the way for using the framework of numerical steepest descent methods on a wider class of problems, like the 3D high frequency scattering from convex obstacles, up to now only handled in a satisfactory way by methods due to Ganesh and Hawkins (J Comp Phys 230:104–125, 2011).",Andreas Asheim,BIT Numerical Mathematics,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10543-013-0463-z,"Multivariate oscillatory integrals,Oscillatory quadrature,Scattering"
