0,Toward the History of the Saint Petersburg School of Probability and Statistics. I. Limit Theorems for Sums of Independent Random Variables,"This is the first in a series of reviews devoted to the scientific achievements of the Leningrad–St. Petersburg school of probability and statistics in the period from 1947 to 2017. It is devoted to limit theorems for sums of independent random variables—a traditional subject for St. Petersburg. It refers to the classical limit theorems: the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem, and the law of the iterated logarithm, as well as important relevant problems formulated in the second half of the twentieth century. The latter include the approximation of the distributions of sums of independent variables by infinitely divisible distributions, estimation of the accuracy of strong Gaussian approximation of such sums, and the limit theorems on the weak almost sure convergence of empirical measures generated by sequences of sums of independent random variables and vectors.","M.

0,Probability and expectation inequalities,"This paper introduces a mathematical framework within which a wide variety of known and new inequalities can be viewed from a common perspective. Probability and expectation inequalities of the following types are considered: (a)P(ZεA)≧ P(Z′εA) for some class of setsA, (b)ℰk(Z)≧ℰk(Z′) for some class of functionsk, and (c)ℰl(Z)≧ℰk(Z′) for some class of pairs of functionsl andk. It is shown, sometimes using explicit constructions ofZ andZ′, that, in several cases, (a) ⇔ (b) ⇔ (c); included here are cases of normal and elliptically contoured distributions. A case where (a) ⇒ (b) ⇔ (c) is studied and is expressed in terms of“n monotone” functions for (some of) which integral representations are obtained. Also, necessary and sufficient conditions for (c) are given.",Stamatis Cambanis1 & Gordon Simons,Zeitschrift für Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Verwandte Gebiete,1982,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00575522,"Stochastic Process,Probability Theory,Integral Representation,Mathematical Biology,Explicit Construction"
0,Ranking probability measures by inclusion indices in the case of unknown utility function,"This paper gives a way of analyzing decisions in the case of unknown utility function, or more precisely, when we know only a linear order on an income space. It is shown that in this situation, decisions and corresponding probability measures are partially ordered, and this order is identical to the inclusion relation of comonotone fuzzy sets. It enables us to use inclusion indices of fuzzy sets to analyze the comparability of decisions. To do this, we introduce an inclusion index having properties, which are close to ones of the classical expected utility.",A. G. Bronevich1 & I. N.

0,Geometric Inference for Probability Measures,"Data often comes in the form of a point cloud sampled from an unknown compact subset of Euclidean space. The general goal of geometric inference is then to recover geometric and topological features (e.g., Betti numbers, normals) of this subset from the approximating point cloud data. It appears that the study of distance functions allows one to address many of these questions successfully. However, one of the main limitations of this framework is that it does not cope well with outliers or with background noise. In this paper, we show how to extend the framework of distance functions to overcome this problem. Replacing compact subsets by measures, we introduce a notion of distance function to a probability distribution in ℝd. These functions share many properties with classical distance functions, which make them suitable for inference purposes. In particular, by considering appropriate level sets of these distance functions, we show that it is possible to reconstruct offsets of sampled shapes with topological guarantees even in the presence of outliers. Moreover, in settings where empirical measures are considered, these functions can be easily evaluated, making them of particular practical interest.","Frédéric Chazal1, David Cohen-Steiner2 & Quentin Mérigot",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-011-9098-0,"Geometric inference,Computational topology,Optimal transportation,Nearest neighbor,Surface reconstruction"
0,Probability maximization via Minkowski functionals: convex representations and tractable resolution,"In this paper, we consider the maximizing of the probability \({\mathbb {P}}\left\{ \, \zeta \, \mid \, \zeta \, \in \, {\mathbf {K}}({\mathbf {x}}) \, \right\} \) over a closed and convex set \({\mathcal {X}}\), a special case of the chance-constrained optimization problem. Suppose \({\mathbf {K}}({\mathbf {x}}) \, \triangleq \, \left\{ \, \zeta \, \in \, {\mathcal {K}}\, \mid \, c({\mathbf {x}},\zeta ) \, \ge \, 0 \right\} \), and \(\zeta \) is uniformly distributed on a convex and compact set \({\mathcal {K}}\) and \(c({\mathbf {x}},\zeta )\) is defined as either \(c({\mathbf {x}},\zeta )\, \triangleq \, 1-\left| \zeta ^T{\mathbf {x}}\right| ^m\) where \(m\ge 0\) (Setting A) or \(c({\mathbf {x}},\zeta ) \, \triangleq \, T{\mathbf {x}}\, - \, \zeta \) (Setting B). We show that in either setting, by leveraging recent findings in the context of non-Gaussian integrals of positively homogenous functions, \({\mathbb {P}}\left\{ \,\zeta \, \mid \, \zeta \, \in \, {\mathbf {K}}({\mathbf {x}}) \, \right\} \) can be expressed as the expectation of a suitably defined continuous function \(F(\bullet ,\xi )\) with respect to an appropriately defined Gaussian density (or its variant), i.e. \({\mathbb {E}}_{{{\tilde{p}}}} \left[ \, F({\mathbf {x}},\xi )\, \right] \). Aided by a recent observation in convex analysis, we then develop a convex representation of the original problem requiring the minimization of \(g\left( {\mathbb {E}}\left[ \, F(\bullet ,\xi )\, \right] \right) \) over \({\mathcal {X}}\), where g is an appropriately defined smooth convex function. Traditional stochastic approximation schemes cannot contend with the minimization of \(g\left( {\mathbb {E}}\left[ F(\bullet ,\xi )\right] \right) \) over \(\mathcal X\), since conditionally unbiased sampled gradients are unavailable. We then develop a regularized variance-reduced stochastic approximation (r-VRSA) scheme that obviates the need for such unbiasedness by combining iterative regularization with variance-reduction. Notably, (r-VRSA) is characterized by almost-sure convergence guarantees, a convergence rate of \(\mathcal {O}(1/k^{1/2-a})\) in expected sub-optimality where \(a > 0\), and a sample complexity of \(\mathcal {O}(1/\epsilon ^{6+\delta })\) where \(\delta > 0\). To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first such scheme for probability maximization problems with convergence and rate guarantees. Preliminary numerics on a portfolio selection problem (Setting A) and a set-covering problem (Setting B) suggest that the scheme competes well with naive mini-batch SA schemes as well as integer programming approximation methods.","I.

The stochastic Lyapunov functions-based conditions of the partial stability in probability are established. In addition to the main Lyapunov function, an auxiliary (generally speaking, vector-valued) function is introduced for correcting the domain in which the main Lyapunov function is constructed. A comparison with the well-known results on the partial stability of the systems of stochastic differential equations is given.

Several different approximations for the throttle are considered, but most attention is given to a Brownian or diffusion approximation. The Brownian approximation is supported by a heavy-traffic limit theorem (as the traffic intensity approaches the upper limit for stability) for which an upper bound on the rate of convergence is established. Means and squared coefficients of variation associated with renewal-process approximations for the overflow processes are also obtained from the Brownian approximation. The accuracy of the Brownian approximation is investigated by making numerical comparisons with exact values. The relatively simple Brownian approximation for the job overflow rate is not very accurate for small overflow rates, but it nevertheless provides important insights into the way the throttle design parameters should depend on the arrival-process characteristics in order to achieve a specified overflow rate. This simple approximation also provides estimates of the sensitivity of the overflow rates to the model parameters.",Arthur W.

0,State Space Truncation with Quantified Errors for Accurate Solutions to Discrete Chemical Master Equation,"The discrete chemical master equation (dCME) provides a general framework for studying stochasticity in mesoscopic reaction networks. Since its direct solution rapidly becomes intractable due to the increasing size of the state space, truncation of the state space is necessary for solving most dCMEs. It is therefore important to assess the consequences of state space truncations so errors can be quantified and minimized. Here we describe a novel method for state space truncation. By partitioning a reaction network into multiple molecular equivalence groups (MEGs), we truncate the state space by limiting the total molecular copy numbers in each MEG. We further describe a theoretical framework for analysis of the truncation error in the steady-state probability landscape using reflecting boundaries. By aggregating the state space based on the usage of a MEG and constructing an aggregated Markov process, we show that the truncation error of a MEG can be asymptotically bounded by the probability of states on the reflecting boundary of the MEG. Furthermore, truncating states of an arbitrary MEG will not undermine the estimated error of truncating any other MEGs. We then provide an overall error estimate for networks with multiple MEGs. To rapidly determine the appropriate size of an arbitrary MEG, we also introduce an a priori method to estimate the upper bound of its truncation error. This a priori estimate can be rapidly computed from reaction rates of the network, without the need of costly trial solutions of the dCME. As examples, we show results of applying our methods to the four stochastic networks of (1) the birth and death model, (2) the single gene expression model, (3) the genetic toggle switch model, and (4) the phage lambda bistable epigenetic switch model. We demonstrate how truncation errors and steady-state probability landscapes can be computed using different sizes of the MEG(s) and how the results validate our theories. Overall, the novel state space truncation and error analysis methods developed here can be used to ensure accurate direct solutions to the dCME for a large number of stochastic networks.","Youfang Cao1 nAff2, Anna Terebus1 & Jie Liang",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-016-0149-1,"Stochastic biological networks,Discrete chemical master equation,State space truncation"

0,A Petri net based approach for multi-robot path planning,"This paper presents a procedure for creating a probabilistic finite-state model for mobile robots and for finding a sequence of controllers ensuring the highest probability for reaching some desired regions. The approach starts by using results for controlling affine systems in simpliceal partitions, and then it creates a finite-state representation with history-based probabilities on transitions. This representation is embedded into a Petri Net model with probabilistic costs on transitions, and a highest probability path to reach a set of target regions is found. An online supervising procedure updates the paths whenever a robot deviates from the intended trajectory.

0,On Necessary Conditions of Probability Limit Theorems in Finite Algebras,"AbstractWe consider the conditions for a finite set with a given system of operations (a finite algebra) to be subject to a probability limit theorem, i.e., arbitrary computations with mutually independent random variables have value distributions that tend to a certain limit (limit law) as the number of random variables used in the computation grows. Such behavior may be seen as a generalization of the central limit theorem that holds for sums of continuous random variables. We show that the existence of a limit probability law in a finite algebra has strong implications for its set of operations. In particular, with some geometric exceptions excluded, the existence of a limit law without zero components implies that all operations in the algebra are quasigroup operations and the limit law is uniform.",A.

0,The Worst Drug Rule Revisited: Mathematical Modeling of Cyclic Cancer Treatments,"In drug treatments of cancer, cyclic treatment strategies are characterized by alternating applications of two (or more) different drugs, given one at a time. One of the main problems of drug treatment in cancer is associated with the generation of drug resistance by mutations of cancerous cells. We use mathematical methods to develop general guidelines on optimal cyclic treatment scheduling, with the aim of minimizing the resistance generation. We define a condition on the drugs’ potencies which allows for a relatively successful application of cyclic therapies. We find that the best strategy is to start with the stronger drug, but use longer cycle durations for the weaker drug. We further investigate the situation where a degree of cross-resistance is present, such that certain mutations cause cells to become resistant to both drugs simultaneously. We show that the general rule (best-drug-first, worst-drug-longer) is unchanged by the presence of cross-resistance. We design a systematic method to test all strategies and come up with the optimal timing and drug order. The role of various constraints in the optimal therapy design, and in particular, suboptimal treatment durations and drug toxicity, is considered. The connection with the “worst drug rule” of Day (Cancer Res. 46:3876, 1986b) is discussed.",Allen A. Katouli1 & Natalia L.

0,Analyzing the performance of simultaneous generalized hill climbing algorithms,"
Simultaneous generalized hill climbing (SGHC) algorithms provide a framework for using heuristics to simultaneously address sets of intractable discrete optimization problems where information is shared between the problems during the algorithm execution. Many well-known heuristics can be embedded within the SGHC algorithm framework. This paper shows that the solutions generated by an SGHC algorithm are a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property. This allows problem probability mass functions to be formulated for particular sets of problems based on the long-term behavior of the algorithm. Such results can be used to determine the proportion of iterations that an SGHC algorithm will spend optimizing over each discrete optimization problem. Sufficient conditions that guarantee that the algorithm spends an equal number of iterations in each discrete optimization problem are provided. SGHC algorithms can also be formulated such that the overall performance of the algorithm is independent of the initial discrete optimization problem chosen. Sufficient conditions are obtained guaranteeing that an SGHC algorithm will visit the globally optimal solution for each discrete optimization problem. Lastly, rates of convergence for SGHC algorithms are reported that show that given a rate of convergence for the embedded GHC algorithm, the SGHC algorithm can be designed to preserve this rate.

0,"Improved Low-Degree Testing and its
Applications","NP = PCP(log n, 1) and
related results crucially depend upon the close connection
between the probability with which a function passes a
low degree test and the
distance of this function to the nearest degree
d polynomial. In this paper
we study a test proposed by Rubinfeld and Sudan [30]. The
strongest previously known connection for this test states that
a function passes the test with probability δ for some δ >
7/8 iff the function has agreement ≈ δ with a polynomial of
degree d. We present a new,
and surprisingly strong, analysis which shows that the preceding
statement is true for arbitrarily small ≈, provided the field
size is polynomially larger than d/δ. The analysis uses a
version of Hilbert
irreducibility, a tool of algebraic geometry.As a consequence we obtain an alternate construction for
the following proof system: A constant prover 1-round proof
system for NP languages in which the verifier uses
O(log n) random bits, receives answers of
size O(log
n) bits, and has an error
probability of at most 
\( 2^{{ - \log ^{{1 - \in }} n}} \). Such a proof system,
which implies the NP-hardness of approximating Set Cover to
within Ω(log n) factors, has
already been obtained by Raz and Safra [29]. Raz and Safra
obtain their result by giving a strong analysis, in the sense
described above, of a new low-degree test that they
present.A second consequence of our analysis is a self
tester/corrector for any buggy program that (supposedly)
computes a polynomial over a finite field. If the program is
correct only on δ fraction of inputs where 
\( \delta = 1/{\left| F \right|}^{ \in } \ll 0.5 \), then the
tester/corrector determines δ and generates 
\( O{\left( {\frac{1} {\delta }} \right)} \) values for every input,
such that one of them is the correct output. In fact, our
results yield something stronger: Given the buggy program, we
can construct 
\( O{\left( {\frac{1} {\delta }} \right)} \) randomized programs such that one of them is
correct on every input, with high probability. Such a strong
self-corrector is a useful tool in complexity theory—with some

0,"Stopping criteria for, and strong convergence of, stochastic gradient descent on Bottou-Curtis-Nocedal functions","Stopping criteria for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) methods play important roles from enabling adaptive step size schemes to providing rigor for downstream analyses such as asymptotic inference. Unfortunately, current stopping criteria for SGD methods are often heuristics that rely on asymptotic normality results or convergence to stationary distributions, which may fail to exist for nonconvex functions and, thereby, limit the applicability of such stopping criteria. To address this issue, in this work, we rigorously develop two stopping criteria for SGD that can be applied to a broad class of nonconvex functions, which we term Bottou-Curtis-Nocedal functions. Moreover, as a prerequisite for developing these stopping criteria, we prove that the gradient function evaluated at SGD’s iterates converges strongly to zero for Bottou-Curtis-Nocedal functions, which addresses an open question in the SGD literature. As a result of our work, our rigorously developed stopping criteria can be used to develop new adaptive step size schemes or bolster other downstream analyses for nonconvex functions.","Vivak Patel

0,An efficient approach for calculating default probabilities for cash-flow based project finance with reserve account,"The quantitative assessment of risks associated with several types, eg, rating methods for cash-flow driven projects, can be reduced to determining the probability that a random variable, for instance representing a cash-flow, drops below a given threshold. That probability can be derived in an analytic closed form, if the underlying distribution is not too complex. However, in practice there is often a reserve account in place, which saves excess cash to reduce the volatility of the cash-flow available for debt service. Due to the reserve account, the derivation of a solution in an analytic closed form is even in the case of rather simple underlying distributions, eg, independent Gaussian distribution, not feasible. In this paper, we present two very efficient approximation methodologies for calculating the probability that a random variable falls under a threshold allowing the presence of a reserve account. The first proposed approach is derived using transition probabilities. The resulting recursive scheme can be implemented easily and yields fast and stable results even in the case of dependent cash-flows. The second methodology uses the similarity of the considered stochastic processes with convection-diffusion processes and combines the stochastic transition probabilities with the finite volume method, which is well known for solving partial differential equations.

The Fourier coefficients are calculated on a limited sample for estimating the phase probability distribution function. In this case, the thus obtained Fourier coefficients are regularized.

0,Common probability-based interactive algorithms for group decision making with normalized probability linguistic preference relations,"Probabilistic linguistic variable is a kind of powerful qualitative fuzzy sets, which permits the decision makers (DMs) to apply several linguistic variables with probabilities to denote a judgment. This paper studies group decision making (GDM) with normalized probability linguistic preference relations (NPLPRs). To achieve this goal, an acceptably multiplicative consistency based interactive algorithm is provided to derive common probability linguistic preference relations (CPLPRs) from PLPRs, by which a new acceptably multiplicative consistency concept for NPLPRs is defined. When the multiplicative consistency of NPLPRs is unacceptable, models for deriving acceptably multiplicatively consistent NPLPRs are constructed. Then, it studies incomplete NPLPRs (InNPLPRs) and offers a common probability and acceptably multiplicative consistency based interactive algorithm to determine missing judgments. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between CPLPRs is provided, by which the weights of the DMs are ascertained. Meanwhile, a consensus index based on CPLPRs is defined. When the consensus does not reach the requirement, a model to increase the level of consensus is built that can ensure the adjusted LPRs to meet the multiplicative consistency and consensus requirement. Moreover, an interactive algorithm for GDM with NPLPRs is provided, which can address unacceptably multiplicatively consistent InNPLPRs. Finally, an example about the evaluation of green design schemes for new energy vehicles is provided to indicate the application of the new algorithm and comparative analysis is conducted.","Jie Tang1, Fanyong Meng1 & Yongliang Zhang",Fuzzy Optimization and Decision Making,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10700-021-09360-1,"Group decision making,NPLPR,Common probability,Acceptably multiplicative consistency,Consensus"
0,Probability distribution based weights for weighted arithmetic aggregation operators,"One key point in the multiple attribute decision making is to determine the associated weights. In this paper, we first briefly review some main methods for determining the weights by using distribution functions. Then, motivated by the idea of data distribution, we develop some novel methods for obtaining the weights associated with the weighted arithmetic aggregation operators. The methods can relieve the influence of biased data on the decision results by weighting these data with small values based on the corresponding probability of data. Furthermore, some commonly used probability distribution methods are used to solve the problems in different conditions. Finally, four practical examples are provided to illustrate the weighting method.","Zhan Su1, Zeshui Xu2 & Shousheng Liu",Fuzzy Optimization and Decision Making,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10700-015-9220-x,"Multiple attribute decision making (MADM),Probability distribution,Ordered weighted aggregation (OWA) operators,Weighted arithmetic aggregation (WAA) operators"
0,Optimal models with maximizing probability of first achieving target value in the preceding stages,"Decision makers often face the need of performance guarantee with some sufficiently high probability. Such problems can be modelled using a discrete time Markov decision process (MDP) with a probability criterion for the first achieving target value. The objective is to find a policy that maximizes the probability of the total discounted reward exceeding a target value in the preceding stages. We show that our formulation cannot be described by former models with standard criteria. We provide the properties of the objective functions, optimal value functions and optimal policies. An algorithm for computing the optimal policies for the finite horizon case is given. In this stochastic stopping model, we prove that there exists an optimal deterministic and stationary policy and the optimality equation has a unique solution. Using perturbation analysis, we approximate general models and prove the existence of ε-optimal policy for finite state space. We give an example for the reliability of the satellite systems using the above theory. Finally, we extend these results to more general cases.","Yuanlie Lin1, Congbin Wu1 & Boda Kang",Science in China Series A: Mathematics,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1360/03ys9042,"probability criterion,Markov decision processes,minimizing risk,first achieving target value"

0,Global optimization using random embeddings,"We propose a random-subspace algorithmic framework for global optimization of Lipschitz-continuous objectives, and analyse its convergence using novel tools from conic integral geometry. X-REGO randomly projects, in a sequential or simultaneous manner, the high-dimensional original problem into low-dimensional subproblems that can then be solved with any global, or even local, optimization solver. We estimate the probability that the randomly-embedded subproblem shares (approximately) the same global optimum as the original problem. This success probability is then used to show almost sure convergence of X-REGO to an approximate global solution of the original problem, under weak assumptions on the problem (having a strictly feasible global solution) and on the solver (guaranteed to find an approximate global solution of the reduced problem with sufficiently high probability). In the particular case of unconstrained objectives with low effective dimension, we propose an X-REGO variant that explores random subspaces of increasing dimension until finding the effective dimension of the problem, leading to X-REGO globally converging after a finite number of embeddings, proportional to the effective dimension. We show numerically that this variant efficiently finds both the effective dimension and an approximate global minimizer of the original problem.

In contrast, we are able to obtain analytical results for cases where the exponential growth of cancer has been replaced by other, arguably more realistic types of growth of a heterogeneous tumor cell population. Our main result is that the probability that a given random mutation will be present by the time a tumor reaches a certain size, is independent of the type of curve assumed for the average growth of the tumor, at least for a general class of growth curves.

0,"Small Complete Arcs in Projective
Planes","In the late 1950’s, B. Segre introduced the fundamental
notion of arcs and complete arcs [48,49]. An arc in a ﬁnite
projective plane is a set of points with no three on a line and
it is complete if cannot be extended without violating this
property. Given a projective plane 
\( {\user1{P}} \), determining 
\( n{\left( {\user1{P}} \right)} \), the size of its
smallest complete arc, has been a major open question in finite
geometry for several decades. Assume that 
\( {\user1{P}} \) has order
q, it was shown by Lunelli
and Sce [41], more than 40 years ago, that 
\( {\left( {\user1{P}} \right)} \geqslant {\sqrt {2q} } \). Apart from this bound,
practically nothing was known about 
\( n{\left( {\user1{P}} \right)} \) , except for the case 
\( {\user1{P}} \) is the Galois plane. For
this case, the best upper bound, prior to this paper, was
O(q
3/4)
obtained by Szőnyi using the properties of the Galois field
GF(q).In this paper, we prove that 
\( n{\left( {\user1{P}} \right)} \leqslant {\sqrt q }{\kern 1pt} \log ^{c} q \) for any projective plane

\( {\user1{P}} \) of order
q, where
c is a universal constant.
Together with Lunelli-Sce’s lower bound, our result determines 
\( n{\left( {\user1{P}} \right)} \) up to a polylogarithmic
factor. Our proof uses a probabilistic method known as the
dynamic random construction or Rödl’s nibble. The proof also
gives a quick randomized algorithm which produces a small
complete arc with high probability.The key ingredient of our proof is a new concentration
result, which applies for non-Lipschitz functions and is of
independent interest.",J. H. Kim1 & V. H. Vu*,Combinatorica,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00493-003-0024-1,05B25
0,Persistence in fluctuating environments for interacting structured populations,"Individuals within any species exhibit differences in size, developmental state, or spatial location. These differences coupled with environmental fluctuations in demographic rates can have subtle effects on population persistence and species coexistence. To understand these effects, we provide a general theory for coexistence of structured, interacting species living in a stochastic environment. The theory is applicable to nonlinear, multi species matrix models with stochastically varying parameters. The theory relies on long-term growth rates of species corresponding to the dominant Lyapunov exponents of random matrix products. Our coexistence criterion requires that a convex combination of these long-term growth rates is positive with probability one whenever one or more species are at low density. When this condition holds, the community is stochastically persistent: the fraction of time that a species density goes below \(\delta >0\) approaches zero as \(\delta \) approaches zero. Applications to predator-prey interactions in an autocorrelated environment, a stochastic LPA model, and spatial lottery models are provided. These applications demonstrate that positive autocorrelations in temporal fluctuations can disrupt predator-prey coexistence, fluctuations in log-fecundity can facilitate persistence in structured populations, and long-lived, relatively sedentary competing populations are likely to coexist in spatially and temporally heterogenous environments.",Gregory Roth1 & Sebastian J.

0,Environmental Fluctuations and Level of Density-Compensation Strongly Affects the Probability of Fixation and Fixation Times,"The probability of, and time to, fixation of a mutation in a population has traditionally been studied by the classic Wright–Fisher model where population size is constant. Recent theoretical expansions have covered fluctuating populations in various ways but have not incorporated models of how the environment fluctuates in combination with different levels of density-compensation affecting fecundity. We tested the hypothesis that the probability of, and time to, fixation of neutral, advantageous and deleterious mutations is dependent on how the environment fluctuates over time, and on the level of density-compensation. We found that fixation probabilities and times were dependent on the pattern of autocorrelation of carrying capacity over time and interacted with density-compensation. The pattern found was most pronounced at small population sizes. The patterns differed greatly depending on whether the mutation was neutral, advantageous, or disadvantageous. The results indicate that the degree of mismatch between carrying capacity and population size is a key factor, rather than population size per se, and that effective population sizes can be very low also when the census population size is far above the carrying capacity. This study highlights the need for explicit population dynamic models and models for environmental fluctuations for the understanding of the dynamics of genes in populations.","M. Björklund1, E.

0,Sharp transition of the invertibility of the adjacency matrices of sparse random graphs,"We consider three models of sparse random graphs: undirected and directed Erdős–Rényi graphs and random bipartite graph with two equal parts. For such graphs, we show that if the edge connectivity probability p satisfies \(np\ge \log n+k(n)\) with \(k(n)\rightarrow \infty \) as \(n\rightarrow \infty \), then the adjacency matrix is invertible with probability approaching one (n is the number of vertices in the two former cases and the same for each part in the latter case). For \(np\le \log n-k(n)\) these matrices are invertible with probability approaching zero, as \(n\rightarrow \infty \). In the intermediate region, when \(np=\log n+k(n)\), for a bounded sequence \(k(n)\in \mathbb {R}\), the event \(\Omega _0\) that the adjacency matrix has a zero row or a column and its complement both have a non-vanishing probability. For such choices of p our results show that conditioned on the event \(\Omega _0^c\) the matrices are again invertible with probability tending to one. This shows that the primary reason for the non-invertibility of such matrices is the existence of a zero row or a column. We further derive a bound on the (modified) condition number of these matrices on \(\Omega _0^c\), with a large probability, establishing von Neumann’s prediction about the condition number up to a factor of \(n^{o(1)}\).","Anirban Basak

Optimization of the model consists in finding a tradeoff “mutual information–error probability” (MIEP) relation between the minimal average mutual information and the error probability, which is analogous to the well-known rate distortion function for source coding with a given fidelity in the case of a noisy observation channel. A lower bound for the MIEP relation is constructed, which provides a lower bound for the classification error probability on a given set of objects for any fixed value of the average mutual information. The MIEP relation and its lower bound are generalized to ensembles of sources. The obtained bounds are useful for estimating the error probability redundancy for decision algorithms with given sets of discriminant functions.","A. M. Lange1, M. M. Lange1 & S. V.

The article proposes an approach to the description of aggregated dynamics of systems consisting of identical interacting elements.

We implement a stochastic competitive Lotka–Volterra model with two types and intra- and interspecific competition. The model further allows for stochastically varying population sizes. The competition coefficients are interpreted in terms of inverse payoffs emerging from an evolutionary game. Since our study focuses on the impact of the competition values, we assume the same net growth rate for both types. In this general framework, we derive a formula for the fixation probability \(\varphi \) of the mutant type under weak selection. We find that the most important parameter deciding over the invasion success of the mutant is its death rate due to competition with the resident. Furthermore, we compare our approximation to results obtained by implementing population size changes deterministically in order to explore the parameter regime of validity of our method. Finally, we put our formula in the context of classical evolutionary game theory and observe similarities and differences to the results obtained in that constant population size setting.","Peter Czuppon

In principle, it is therefore possible to express the density operator by a joint probability of two observables that cannot actually be measured jointly because they do not have any common eigenstates. However, such joint probabilities do not refer to an actual measurement outcome, so their definition cannot be based on a set of possible events. Here, I consider the criteria that could specify a unique mathematical form of joint probabilities in the quantum formalism.

0,Processor sharing: A survey of the mathematical theory,"During last few decades the Egalitarian Processor Sharing (EPS) has gained a prominent role in applied probability, especially, in queueing theory and its computer applications. While the EPS paradigm emerged in 1967 as an idealization of round-robin (RR) scheduling algorithm in time-sharing computer systems, it has recently capture renewed interest as a powerful concept for modeling WEB servers. This paper summarizes the most important results concerning the exact solutions for the M/GI/1 queue with egalitarian processor sharing. The material is drawn, mainly, from recent authors’ papers which are supplemented, in small degree, by other related results. Many of the further results are established under the direct influence of our earlier papers. Our main purpose is to give a survey of state-of-the-art with regard to main achievements of the contemporary theory of the M/GI/1 queueing system with processor sharing. The focus is on the methods and techniques of exact and asymptotic analysis of this queueing system. In contrast to the standard surveys, the abridged proofs (or their ideas) of some key theorems and corollaries are included in the paper. We outline recent developments in exact analysis of the M/GI/1-EPS queue with further emphasis on time-dependent (transient) probability distributions of the main characteristics. In particular, the present paper includes the results on the joint time-dependent distribution of the sojourn time of a job arriving at time t with the service demand (length) u, and of the number of jobs at time t- in the M/GI/1 queue with egalitarian processor sharing, which obtained in form of multiple transforms.

Objects are viewed as metric measure spaces, and based on ideas from mass transportation, a Gromov–Wasserstein type of distance between objects is defined. This reformulation yields a distance between objects which is more amenable to practical computations but retains all the desirable theoretical underpinnings. The theoretical properties of this new notion of distance are studied, and it is established that it provides a strict metric on the collection of isomorphism classes of metric measure spaces. Furthermore, the topology generated by this metric is studied, and sufficient conditions for the pre-compactness of families of metric measure spaces are identified. A second goal of this paper is to establish links to several other practical methods proposed in the literature for comparing/matching shapes in precise terms. This is done by proving explicit lower bounds for the proposed distance that involve many of the invariants previously reported by researchers. These lower bounds can be computed in polynomial time.

0,The Analysis of Evolutionary Algorithms on Sorting and Shortest Paths Problems,"The analysis of evolutionary algorithms is up to now limited to special classes of functions and fitness landscapes. E.g., it is not possible to characterize the set of TSP instances (or another NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem) which are solved by a generic evolutionary algorithm (EA) in an expected time bounded by some given polynomial. As a first step from artificial functions to typical problems from combinatorial optimization, we analyze simple EAs on well-known problems, namely sorting and shortest paths. Although it cannot be expected that EAs outperform the well-known problem specific algorithms on these simple problems, it is interesting to analyze how EAs work on these problems. The following results are obtained:– Sorting is the maximization of “sortedness” which is measured by one of several well-known measures of presortedness.

We show that Markov decision processes (MDPs) and the policy-gradient approach, or perturbation analysis (PA), can be derived easily from two fundamental sensitivity formulas, and such formulas can be flexibly constructed, by first principles, with performance potentials as building blocks. Second, with this sensitivity view we propose an event-based optimization approach, including the event-based sensitivity analysis and event-based policy iteration. This approach utilizes the special feature of a system characterized by events and illustrates how the potentials can be aggregated using the special feature and how the aggregated potential can be used in policy iteration. Compared with the traditional MDP approach, the event-based approach has its advantages: the number of aggregated potentials may scale to the system size despite that the number of states grows exponentially in the system size, this reduces the policy space and saves computation; the approach does not require actions at different states to be independent; and it utilizes the special feature of a system and does not need to know the exact transition probability matrix. The main ideas of the approach are illustrated by an admission control problem.",Xi-Ren Cao,Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10626-004-6211-4,"perturbation analysis,Markov decision processes (MDPs),POMDPs,performance potentials,policy iteration,policy gradients,aggregation"
0,Convergence of random walks with Markovian cookie stacks to Brownian motion perturbed at extrema,"We consider one-dimensional excited random walks (ERWs) with i.i.d. Markovian cookie stacks in the non-boundary recurrent regime. We prove that under diffusive scaling such an ERW converges in the standard Skorokhod topology to a multiple of Brownian motion perturbed at its extrema (BMPE). All parameters of the limiting process are given explicitly in terms of those of the cookie Markov chain at a single site. While our results extend the results in Dolgopyat and Kosygina (Electron Commun Probab 17:1–14, 2012) (ERWs with boundedly many cookies per stack) and Kosygina and Peterson (Electron J Probab 21:1–24, 2016) (ERWs with periodic cookie stacks), the approach taken is very different and involves coarse graining of both the ERW and the random environment changed by the walk. Through a careful analysis of the environment left by the walk after each “mesoscopic” step, we are able to construct a coupling of the ERW at this “mesoscopic” scale with a suitable discretization of the limiting BMPE. The analysis is based on generalized Ray–Knight theorems for the directed edge local times of the ERW stopped at certain stopping times and evolving in both the original random cookie environment and (which is much more challenging) in the environment created by the walk after each “mesoscopic” step.","Elena Kosygina

0,The analysis of evolutionary algorithms on sorting and shortest paths problems,"The analysis of evolutionary algorithms is up to now limited to special classes of functions and fitness landscapes. E.g., it is not possible to characterize the set of TSP instances (or another NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem) which are solved by a generic evolutionary algorithm (EA) in an expected time bounded by some given polynomial. As a first step from artificial functions to typical problems from combinatorial optimization, we analyze simple EAs on well-known problems, namely sorting and shortest paths. Although it cannot be expected that EAs outperform the well-known problem specific algorithms on these simple problems, it is interesting to analyze how EAs work on these problems. The following results are obtained:

- Sorting is the maximization of “sortedness” which is measured by one of several well-known measures of presortedness. The different measures of presortedness lead to fitness functions of quite different difficulty for EAs.


- Shortest paths problems are hard for all types of EA, if they are considered as single-objective optimization problems, whereas they are easy as multi-objective optimization problems.

0,Random generation and scaling limits of fixed genus factorizations into transpositions,"We study the asymptotic behaviour of random factorizations of the n-cycle into transpositions of fixed genus \(g>0\). They have a geometric interpretation as branched covers of the sphere and their enumeration as Hurwitz numbers was extensively studied in algebraic combinatorics and enumerative geometry. On the probabilistic side, several models and properties of permutation factorizations were studied in previous works, in particular minimal factorizations of cycles into transpositions (which corresponds to the case \(g=0\) of this work). Using the representation of factorizations via unicellular maps, we first exhibit an algorithm which samples an asymptotically uniform factorization of genus g in linear time. In a second time, we code a factorization as a process of chords appearing one by one in the unit disk, and we prove the convergence (as \(n\rightarrow \infty \)) of the process associated with a uniform genus g factorization of the n-cycle. The limit process can be explicitly constructed from a Brownian excursion. Finally, we establish the convergence of a natural genus process, coding the appearance of the successive genera in the factorization.

0,KPZ equation from non-simple variations on open ASEP,"This paper has two main goals. The first is universality of the KPZ equation for fluctuations of dynamic interfaces associated to interacting particle systems in the presence of open boundary. We consider generalizations on the open-ASEP from Corwin and Shen (Commun Pure Appl Math 71(10):2065–2128, 2018), Parekh (Commun Math Phys 365:569–649, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00220-018-3258-x). but admitting non-simple interactions both at the boundary and within the bulk of the particle system. These variations on open-ASEP are not integrable models, similar to the long-variations on ASEP considered in Dembo and Tsai (Commun Math Phys 341(1):219–261, 2016), Yang (Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation from long-range exclusion processes, 2020. arXiv:2002.05176 [math.PR]). We establish the KPZ equation with the appropriate Robin boundary conditions as scaling limits for height function fluctuations associated to these non-integrable models, providing further evidence for the aforementioned universality of the KPZ equation. We specialize to compact domains and address non-compact domains in a second paper (Yang in KPZ equation from non-simple dynamics with boundary in the non-compact regime). The procedure that we employ to establish the aforementioned theorem is the second main point of this paper. Invariant measures in the presence of boundary interactions generally lack reasonable descriptions. Thus, global analyses done through the invariant measure, including the theory of energy solutions in Goncalves and Jara (Arch Ration Mech Anal 212:597, 2014), Goncalves and Jara (Stoch Process Appl 127(12):4029–4052, 2017), Goncalves et al.

 This construction uses as inputs the diffusion that O’Connell discovered (Ann Probab 40:437–458, 2012) in relation to the O’Connell–Yor semi-discrete Brownian polymer, the convergence result of Moreno Flores et al. (in preparation) of the lowest indexed curve of that diffusion to the solution of the KPZ equation with narrow wedge initial data, and the one-point distribution formula proved by Amir et al.

In this paper, an automated tracking framework is proposed to extract the trajectories of micro-objects. This framework uses a probability hypothesis density particle filtering (PF-PHD) tracker to implement a recursive state estimation and trajectories association. In order to increase the efficiency of this approach, an elliptical target model is presented to describe the micro-objects using shape parameters instead of point-like targets which may cause inaccurate tracking. A novel likelihood function, not only covering the spatiotemporal distance but also dealing with geometric shape function based on the Mahalanobis norm, is proposed to improve the accuracy of particle weight in the update process of the PF-PHD tracker. Using this framework, a larger number of tracks are obtained. The experiments are performed on simulated data of microtubule movements and real mouse stem cells. We compare the PF-PHD tracker with the nearest neighbor method and the multiple hypothesis tracking method.

0,Random sampling and greedy sparsification for matroid optimization problems,"Random sampling is a powerful tool for gathering information about a group by considering only a small part of it. We discuss some broadly applicable paradigms for using random sampling in combinatorial optimization, and demonstrate the effectiveness of these paradigms for two optimization problems on matroids: finding an optimum matroid basis and packing disjoint matroid bases. Application of these ideas to the graphic matroid led to fast algorithms for minimum spanning trees and minimum cuts. An optimum matroid basis is typically found by agreedy algorithm that grows an independent set into an optimum basis one element at a time. This continuous change in the independent set can make it hard to perform the independence tests needed by the greedy algorithm. We simplify matters by using sampling to reduce the problem of finding an optimum matroid basis to the problem of verifying that a givenfixed basis is optimum, showing that the two problems can be solved in roughly the same time. Another application of sampling is to packing matroid bases, also known as matroid partitioning. Sampling reduces the number of bases that must be packed. We combine sampling with a greedy packing strategy that reduces the size of the matroid. Together, these techniques give accelerated packing algorithms. We give particular attention to the problem of packing spanning trees in graphs, which has applications in network reliability analysis. Our results can be seen as generalizing certain results from random graph theory. The techniques have also been effective for other packing problems. © 1998 The Mathematical Programming Society, Inc.

0,Some topics in the dynamics of group actions on rooted trees,"This article combines the features of a survey and a research paper. It presents a review of some results obtained during the last decade in problems related to the dynamics of branch and self-similar groups on the boundary of a spherically homogeneous rooted tree and to the combinatorics and asymptotic properties of Schreier graphs associated with a group or with its action. Special emphasis is placed on the study of essentially free actions of selfsimilar groups, which are antipodes to branch actions. At the same time, the theme “free versus nonfree” runs through the paper. Sufficient conditions are obtained for the essential freeness of an action of a self-similar group on the boundary of a tree. Specific examples of such actions are given. Constructions of the associated dynamical system and the Schreier dynamical system generated by a Schreier graph are presented. For groups acting on trees, a trace on the associated C*-algebra generated by a Koopman representation is introduced, and its role in the study of von Neumann factors, the spectral properties of groups, Schreier graphs, and elements of the associated C*-algebra is demonstrated. The concepts of asymptotic expander and asymptotic Ramanujan graph are introduced, and examples of such graphs are given. Questions related to the notion of the cost of action and the notion of rank gradient are discussed.","R. I.

This integral is explicitly computable in the linear case, recovering known results, and it can be expressed in terms of either complete elliptic integrals or of generalized hypergeometric functions in the non-linear one. Moreover, it appears a remarkable phenomenon when q is even: the probability to have a center is positive, in contrast with what happens in the linear case, or also when q is odd, where this probability is zero.","B.

It is known that, if the value of the objective function is available, one can obtain, in parallel, several independent approximate solutions in terms of the objective residual expectation. Then, choosing the solution with the minimum function value, one can control the probability of large deviation of the objective residual. On the contrary, in this short paper, we address the situation, when the value of the objective function is unavailable or is too expensive to calculate. Under ""‘light-tail""’ assumption for stochastic subgradient and in general case with moderate large deviation probability, we show that parallelization combined with averaging gives bounds for probability of large deviation similar to a serial method. Thus, in these cases, one can benefit from parallel computations and reduce the computational time without loss in the solution quality.","P. E. Dvurechensky1,2, A. V. Gasnikov2,3 & A. A.

0,Almost invariance of distributions for random walks on groups,"We study the neighborhoods of a typical point \(Z_n\) visited at n-th step of a random walk, determined by the condition that the transition probabilities stay close to \(\mu ^{*n}(Z_n)\). If such neighborhood contains a ball of radius \(C \sqrt{n}\), we say that the random walk has almost invariant transition probabilities. We prove that simple random walks on wreath products of \(\mathbb {Z}\) with finite groups have almost invariant distributions. A weaker version of almost invariance implies a necessary condition of Ozawa’s criterion for the property \(H_\mathrm{FD}\). We define and study the radius of almost invariance. We estimate this radius for random walks on iterated wreath products and show this radius can be asymptotically strictly smaller than n / L(n), where L(n) denotes the drift function of the random walk. We show that the radius of individual almost invariance of a simple random walk on the wreath product of \(\mathbb {Z}^2\) with a finite group is asymptotically strictly larger than n / L(n). Finally, we show the existence of groups such that the radius of almost invariance is smaller than a given function, but remains unbounded.

We assume subexponential decay of the distribution of the matrix entries of \(W\) and we choose \(\lambda \sim 1\), so that the eigenvalues of \(W\) and \(\lambda V\) are typically of the same order. Further, we assume that the density of the entries of \(V\) is supported on a single interval and is convex near the edges of its support. In this paper we prove that there is \(\lambda _+\in {\mathbb {R}}^+\) such that the largest eigenvalues of \(H\) are in the limit of large \(N\) determined by the order statistics of \(V\) for \(\lambda >\lambda _+\). In particular, the largest eigenvalue of \(H\) has a Weibull distribution in the limit \(N\rightarrow \infty \) if \(\lambda >\lambda _+\).

Two opposing models have been proposed. In the response-averaging model, the neuron responds with a weighted average of all individual stimuli. By contrast, in the probability-mixing model, the cell responds to a plurality of stimuli as if only one of the stimuli were present. Here we apply the probability-mixing and the response-averaging model to leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, to describe neuronal behavior based on observed spike trains. We first estimate the parameters of either model using numerical methods, and then test which model is most likely to have generated the observed data. Results show that the parameters can be successfully estimated and the two models are distinguishable using model selection.","Kang Li1,2, Claus Bundesen2 & Susanne Ditlevsen",The Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13408-016-0040-2,"Probability-mixing,Response-averaging,Parameter estimation,Model selection,Visual attention"

It yields improved return probability bounds. A key feature is the incorporation of parts of the spectrum of the transition matrix other than just the principal eigenvalue. As an application, an upper bound of the expected return probability of a random walk with symmetric transition probabilities is found. In this case, the state space is a random partial graph of a regular graph of bounded geometry and transitive automorphism group. The law of the random edge-set is assumed to be invariant with respect to some transitive subgroup of the automorphism group (‘invariant percolation’). Given that this subgroup is unimodular, it is shown that this invariance strengthens the upper bound of the expected return probability, compared with standard bounds such as those derived from the Cheeger inequality. The improvement is monotone in the degree of the underlying transitive graph.","Florian Sobieczky1,",Journal of Theoretical Probability,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10959-010-0298-3,"Random walks,Random walks on random partial graphs,Percolation,Critical percolation,Heat kernel decay,Return probability,Comparison theorems"

For a proper hyperbolic space M, we obtain explicit bounds that depend only on M, the size of support of the measure as in the classical case of sums of independent random variables, and on the norm of the driving probability measure in the left regular representation of the group of isometries. We obtain uniform bounds in the case of hyperbolic groups and effective bounds for simple linear groups of rank-one. In a second part, using our concentration inequalities, we give quantitative finite-time estimates on the probability that two independent random walks on the isometry group of a hyperbolic space generate a free non-abelian subgroup. Our concentration results follow from a more general, but less explicit statement that we prove for cocycles which satisfy a certain cohomological equation.

The predictive distribution over actions can then be constructed by a Bayesian superposition of the policies weighted by their posterior probability of being optimal.ResultsHere we discuss two important features of this approach. First, we show in how far such generalized Thompson sampling can be regarded as an optimal strategy under limited information processing capabilities that constrain the sampling complexity of the decision-making process. Second, we show how such Thompson sampling can be extended to solve causal inference problems when interacting with an environment in a sequential fashion.ConclusionIn summary, our results suggest that Thompson sampling might not merely be a useful heuristic, but a principled method to address problems of adaptive sequential decision-making and causal inference.",Pedro A Ortega1 & Daniel A Braun,Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2194-3206-2-2,"Thompson sampling,Adaptive control,Bounded rationality,Decision-making,Causal inference"
0,"Non-interactive correlation distillation, inhomogeneous Markov chains, and the reverse Bonami-Beckner inequality","In this paper we studynon-interactive correlation distillation (NICD), a generalization of noise sensitivity previously considered in [5, 31, 39]. We extend the model toNICD on trees. In this model there is a fixed undirected tree with players at some of the nodes. One node is given a uniformly random string and this string is distributed throughout the network, with the edges of the tree acting as independent binary symmetric channels. The goal of the players is to agree on a shared random bit without communicating.Our new contributions include the following:

• In the case of ak-leaf star graph (the model considered in [31]), we resolve the open question of whether the success probability must go to zero ask » ∞. We show that this is indeed the case and provide matching upper and lower bounds on the asymptotically optimal rate (a slowly-decaying polynomial).


• In the case of thek-vertex path graph, we show that it is always optimal for all players to use the same 1-bit function.


• In the general case we show that all players should use monotone functions. We also show, somewhat surprisingly, that for certain trees it is better if not all players use the same function.


Our techniques include the use of thereverse Bonami-Beckner inequality. Although the usual Bonami-Beckner has been frequently used before, its reverse counterpart seems not to be well known. To demonstrate its strength, we use it to prove a new isoperimetric inequality for the discrete cube and a new result on the mixing of short random walks on the cube. Another tool that we need is a tight bound on the probability that a Markov chain stays inside certain sets; we prove a new theorem generalizing and strengthening previous such bounds [2, 3, 6]. On the probabilistic side, we use the “reflection principle” and the FKG and related inequalities in order to study the problem on general trees.","Elchanan Mossel1, Ryan O'Donnell2, Oded Regev3, Jeffrey E.

Here \({\varDelta }\) is the discrete Laplacian on \(\mathbb Z^d\) and \(\xi =(\xi (z))_{z\in \mathbb Z^d}\) is an i.i.d. random field with doubly-exponential upper tails.

0,Localization of the continuous Anderson Hamiltonian in 1-D,"We study the bottom of the spectrum of the Anderson Hamiltonian \({\mathcal {H}}_L := -\partial _x^2 + \xi \) on [0, L] driven by a white noise \(\xi \) and endowed with either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. We show that, as \(L\rightarrow \infty \), the point process of the (appropriately shifted and rescaled) eigenvalues converges to a Poisson point process on \(\mathbf{R}\) with intensity \(e^x dx\), and that the (appropriately rescaled) eigenfunctions converge to Dirac masses located at independent and uniformly distributed points. Furthermore, we show that the shape of each eigenfunction, recentered around its maximum and properly rescaled, is given by the inverse of a hyperbolic cosine. We also show that the eigenfunctions decay exponentially from their localization centers at an explicit rate, and we obtain very precise information on the zeros and local maxima of these eigenfunctions. Finally, we show that the eigenvalues/eigenfunctions in the Dirichlet and Neumann cases are very close to each other and converge to the same limits.","Laure Dumaz1 & Cyril Labbé

0,Minimizing spectral risk measures applied to Markov decision processes,"We study the minimization of a spectral risk measure of the total discounted cost generated by a Markov Decision Process (MDP) over a finite or infinite planning horizon. The MDP is assumed to have Borel state and action spaces and the cost function may be unbounded above. The optimization problem is split into two minimization problems using an infimum representation for spectral risk measures. We show that the inner minimization problem can be solved as an ordinary MDP on an extended state space and give sufficient conditions under which an optimal policy exists. Regarding the infinite dimensional outer minimization problem, we prove the existence of a solution and derive an algorithm for its numerical approximation. Our results include the findings in Bäuerle and Ott (Math Methods Oper Res 74(3):361–379, 2011) in the special case that the risk measure is Expected Shortfall. As an application, we present a dynamic extension of the classical static optimal reinsurance problem, where an insurance company minimizes its cost of capital.","Nicole Bäuerle

Cumulants of probability set functions enjoy particularly simple properties which make them more manageable than cumulants of general random variables. We derive some identities satisfied by cumulants of probability set functions which we believe to be new. Probability set functions may be expanded in terms of their cumulants. We derive an expansion which allows the construction of examples of probability set functions whose cumulants are arbitrary, restricted only by their absolute values. It is known that this phenomenon cannot occur for continuous probability distributions. Some particular examples of probability set functions are considered, and their cumulants are computed, leading to a conjecture on the upper bound of the values of cumulants. Moments of probability set functions determined by arithmetical conditions are computed in a final example.","William J. Bruno1, Gian-Carlo Rota1 & David C.

0,"Sharpness of the phase transition for continuum percolation in \(\mathbb {R}^2\)
","AbstractWe study the phase transition of random radii Poisson Boolean percolation: Around each point of a planar Poisson point process, we draw a disc of random radius, independently for each point. The behavior of this process is well understood when the radii are uniformly bounded from above. In this article, we investigate this process for unbounded (and possibly heavy tailed) radii distributions. Under mild assumptions on the radius distribution, we show that both the vacant and occupied sets undergo a phase transition at the same critical parameter \(\lambda _c\). Moreover,

For \(\lambda < \lambda _c\), the vacant set has a unique unbounded connected component and we give precise bounds on the one-arm probability for the occupied set, depending on the radius distribution.


At criticality, we establish the box-crossing property, implying that no unbounded component can be found, neither in the occupied nor the vacant sets. We provide a polynomial decay for the probability of the one-arm events, under sharp conditions on the distribution of the radius.


For \(\lambda > \lambda _c\), the occupied set has a unique unbounded component and we prove that the one-arm probability for the vacant decays exponentially fast.

 The techniques we develop in this article can be applied to other models such as the Poisson Voronoi and confetti percolation.

0,On delocalization of eigenvectors of random non-Hermitian matrices,"We study delocalization of null vectors and eigenvectors of random matrices with i.i.d entries. Let A be an \(n\times n\) random matrix with i.i.d real subgaussian entries of zero mean and unit variance. We show that with probability at least \(1-e^{-\log ^{2} n}\)$$\begin{aligned} \min \limits _{I\subset [n],\,|I|= m}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}_I\Vert \ge \frac{m^{3/2}}{n^{3/2}\log ^Cn}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}\Vert \end{aligned}$$for any real eigenvector \(\mathbf{{v}}\) and any \(m\in [\log ^C n,n]\), where \(\mathbf{{v}}_I\) denotes the restriction of \(\mathbf{{v}}\) to I. Further, when the entries of A are complex, with i.i.d real and imaginary parts, we show that with probability at least \(1-e^{-\log ^{2} n}\)all eigenvectors of A are delocalized in the sense that $$\begin{aligned} \min \limits _{I\subset [n],\,|I|= m}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}_I\Vert \ge \frac{m}{n\log ^Cn}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}\Vert \end{aligned}$$for all \(m\in [\log ^C{n},n]\). Comparing with related results, in the range \(m\in [\log ^{C'}{n},n/\log ^{C'}{n}]\) in the i.i.d setting and with weaker probability estimates, our lower bounds on \(\Vert \mathbf{{v}}_I\Vert \) strengthen an earlier estimate \(\min \nolimits _{|I|= m}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}_I\Vert \ge c(m/n)^6\Vert \mathbf{{v}}\Vert \) obtained in Rudelson and Vershynin (Geom Funct Anal 26(6):1716–1776, 2016), and bounds \(\min \nolimits _{|I|= m}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}_I\Vert \ge c(m/n)^2\Vert \mathbf{{v}}\Vert \) (in the real setting) and \(\min \nolimits _{|I|= m}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}_I\Vert \ge c(m/n)^{3/2}\Vert \mathbf{{v}}\Vert \) (in the complex setting) established in Luh and O’Rourke (Eigenvector delocalization for non-Hermitian random matrices and applications. arXiv:1810.00489).

0,On the probability of ruin in the compound Poisson risk model with potentially delayed claims,"In this paper, we consider the compound Poisson risk model involving two types of dependent claims, namely main claims and by-claims. The by-claim is induced by the main claim with a certain probability and the occurrence of a by-claim may be delayed depending on associated main claim amount. Using Rouché’s theorem, both of the survival probability with zero initial surplus and the Laplace transform of the survival probability are obtained from an integro-differential equations system. Then, using the Laplace transform, we derive a defective renewal equation satisfied by the survival probability. An exact representation for the solution of this equation is derived through an associated compound geometric distribution. For exponential claim sizes, we present an explicit formula for the survival probability. We also illustrate the influence of model parameters in the dependent risk model on the survival probability by numerical examples.

0,Stationarity and almost sure divergence of time averages in interval-valued probability,"Our work is motivated by the study of empirical processes (such as flicker noise) that occur in stable systems yet give rise to observations with seemingly divergent time averages. Stationary models for such processes do not exist in the domain of numerical probability, as the ergodic theorems dictate the convergence of time averages of stationary and bounded processes. This has led us to investigate such models in the wider framework of interval-valued probability. In this paper we construct interval-valued probabilities on the space of infinite binary sequences that combine properties of (i) strict stationarity, (ii) unicity of extension from the algebra of cylinder sets to a wider collection containing salient asymptotic events, and (iii) almost sure support of divergence of time averages. These properties are not shared by conventional stochastic models.",Adrian Papamarcou1 & Terrence L.

0,The probability of fixation of a single mutant in an exchangeable selection model,"The Cannings exchangeable model for a finite population in discrete time is extended to incorporate selection. The probability of fixation of a mutant type is studied under the assumption of weak selection. An exact formula for the derivative of this probability with respect to the intensity of selection is deduced, and developed in the case of a single mutant. This formula is expressed in terms of mean coalescence times under neutrality assuming that the coefficient of selection for the mutant type has a derivative with respect to the intensity of selection that takes a polynomial form with respect to the frequency of the mutant type. An approximation is obtained in the case where this derivative is a continuous function of the mutant frequency and the population size is large. This approximation is consistent with a diffusion approximation under moment conditions on the number of descendants of a single individual in one time step. Applications to evolutionary game theory in finite populations are presented.",Sabin Lessard1 & Véronique Ladret,Journal of Mathematical Biology,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-007-0069-7,"Exchangeable model,Coalescence times,Diffusion approximation,Evolutionary game theory,Fixation probability"
0,A distance exponent for Liouville quantum gravity,"Let \(\gamma \in (0,2)\) and let h be the random distribution on \(\mathbb C\) which describes a \(\gamma \)-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) cone. Also let \(\kappa = 16/\gamma ^2 >4\) and let \(\eta \) be a whole-plane space-filling SLE\(_\kappa \) curve sampled independent from h and parametrized by \(\gamma \)-quantum mass with respect to h. We study a family \(\{\mathcal G^\epsilon \}_{\epsilon >0}\) of planar maps associated with \((h, \eta )\) called the LQG structure graphs (a.k.a. mated-CRT maps) which we conjecture converge in probability in the scaling limit with respect to the Gromov–Hausdorff topology to a random metric space associated with \(\gamma \)-LQG. In particular, \(\mathcal G^\epsilon \) is the graph whose vertex set is \(\epsilon \mathbb Z\), with two such vertices \(x_1,x_2\in \epsilon \mathbb Z\) connected by an edge if and only if the corresponding curve segments \(\eta ([x_1-\epsilon , x_1])\) and \(\eta ([x_2-\epsilon ,x_2])\) share a non-trivial boundary arc. Due to the peanosphere description of SLE-decorated LQG due to Duplantier et al. (Liouville quantum gravity as a mating of trees, 2014), the graph \(\mathcal G^\epsilon \) can equivalently be expressed as an explicit functional of a correlated two-dimensional Brownian motion, so can be studied without any reference to SLE or LQG. We prove non-trivial upper and lower bounds for the cardinality of a graph-distance ball of radius n in \(\mathcal G^\epsilon \) which are consistent with the prediction of Watabiki (Prog Theor Phys Suppl 114:1–17, 1993) for the Hausdorff dimension of LQG. Using subadditivity arguments, we also prove that there is an exponent \(\chi > 0\) for which the expected graph distance between generic points in the subgraph of \(\mathcal G^\epsilon \) corresponding to the segment \(\eta ([0,1])\) is of order \(\epsilon ^{-\chi + o_\epsilon (1)}\), and this distance is extremely unlikely to be larger than \(\epsilon ^{-\chi + o_\epsilon (1)}\).","Ewain Gwynne

We use an averaging analysis of the algorithm to relate its behaviour to an associated ordinary differential equation.

Suppose that we observe m entries selected uniformly at random from a matrix M. Can we complete the matrix and recover the entries that we have not seen?We show that one can perfectly recover most low-rank matrices from what appears to be an incomplete set of entries. We prove that if the number m of sampled entries obeys $$m\ge C\,n^{1.2}r\log n$$ for some positive numerical constant C, then with very high probability, most n×n matrices of rank r can be perfectly recovered by solving a simple convex optimization program. This program finds the matrix with minimum nuclear norm that fits the data. The condition above assumes that the rank is not too large. However, if one replaces the 1.2 exponent with 1.25, then the result holds for all values of the rank. Similar results hold for arbitrary rectangular matrices as well.

0,Exchangeable stochastic processes and symmetric states in quantum probability,"We analyze general aspects of exchangeable quantum stochastic processes, as well as some concrete cases relevant for several applications to Quantum Physics and Probability. We establish that there is a one-to-one correspondence between quantum stochastic processes, either preserving or not the identity, and states on free product \(C^*\)-algebras, unital or not unital, respectively, where the exchangeable ones correspond precisely to the symmetric states. We also connect some algebraic properties of exchangeable processes, that is the fact that they satisfy the product state or the block-singleton conditions, to some natural ergodic ones. We then specialize the investigation for the \(q\)-deformed Commutation Relations, \(q\in (-1,1)\) (the case \(q=0\) corresponding to the reduced group \(C^{*}\)-algebra \(C^*_r({\mathbb F}_\infty )\) of the free group \({\mathbb F}_\infty \) on infinitely many generators), and the Boolean ones. A generalization of de Finetti theorem to the Fermi CAR algebra (corresponding to the \(q\)-deformed Commutation Relations with \(q=-1\)) is proven, by showing that any state is symmetric if and only if it is conditionally independent and identically distributed with respect to the tail algebra. Moreover, we show that the Boolean stochastic processes provide examples for which the condition to be independent and identically distributed w.r.t. the tail algebra, without mentioning the a-priori existence of a preserving conditional expectation, is in general meaningless in the quantum setting.

The probability of disease extinction and that of a major outbreak are computed and approximated using the multitype Galton–Watson branching process and numerical simulations, respectively. Analytical and numerical results show some significant differences in model predictions between the stochastic and deterministic models.

0,Data-Driven Method for Efficient Characterization of Rare Event Probabilities in Biochemical Systems,"As mathematical models and computational tools become more sophisticated and powerful to accurately depict system dynamics, numerical methods that were previously considered computationally impractical started being utilized for large-scale simulations. Methods that characterize a rare event in biochemical systems are part of such phenomenon, as many of them are computationally expensive and require high-performance computing. In this paper, we introduce an enhanced version of the doubly weighted stochastic simulation algorithm (dwSSA) (Daigle et al. in J Chem Phys 134:044110, 2011), called dwSSA\(^{++}\), that significantly improves the speed of convergence to the rare event of interest when the conventional multilevel cross-entropy method in dwSSA is either unable to converge or converges very slowly. This achievement is enabled by a novel polynomial leaping method that uses past data to detect slow convergence and attempts to push the system toward the rare event. We demonstrate the performance of dwSSA\(^{++}\) on two systems—a susceptible–infectious–recovered–susceptible disease dynamics model and a yeast polarization model—and compare its computational efficiency to that of dwSSA.","Min K.

Various sufficient conditions for such inequalities are given. Some of them are new even in the classical log-Sobolev case. The idea behind many of these conditions is that measures with a non-convex potential may enjoy such functional inequalities provided they have a strong integrability property that balances the lack of convexity. In addition, several known criteria are recovered in a simple unified way by transportation methods and generalized to the Riemannian setting.",Franck Barthe1 & Alexander V.

0,Some Properties of Multiple Hypergeometric Functions and Applications in the Probability Theory,"AbstractApplication of various types of multiple hypergeometric functions in study of noise immunity of receiption of signal constructions in communications theory are demonstrated. Mathematical model of the communication channel with general fading the form \(y\left(t\right)=\alpha s_{r}\left(t\right)+n\left(t\right)\) is considered, where \(s_{r}\left(t\right)\) is the transmitter signal, \(n\left(t\right)\) is the additive white Gauss noise, and \(\alpha\) is the transmission coefficient, which in the communication channel with fading is a random variable described by a distribution function. The Rice–Nakagami and four-parameter distributions are considered which include three-parameter distribution (Beckmann distribution); two-parameter Hoyt distribution (Nakagami-\(q\)); Rice distribution (Nakagami-\(n\)); Rayleigh distribution; one-sided normal distribution with zero variance and zero expectation. For representation of moments of distributions, a new general special integral function \(\mathcal{S}_{p,q}\left(w,z;b_{1},b_{2};\eta\right)\) is introduced which generalizes the \(\mathcal{H}\)-function by N. V. Savischenko and the Owen function. Various properties including formulas of reduction, differentiation and integration are obtained. The Mellin transforms of some expressions involving the \(\mathcal{H}\)-function are derived. The second type of representations is based on the function \(H_{A}^{(c)}\left(a_{1},a_{2};c_{1},c_{2};x,y,z\right)\), which is a confluent case of the multiple hypergeometric function \(H_{A}\left(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3};c_{1},c_{2};x,y,z\right)\) defined as a hypergeometric series of three variables by H.

0,The Discrete Wiener-Hopf Equation Whose Kernel is a Probability Distribution with Positive Drift,We consider the discrete Wiener-Hopf equation with inhomogeneous term \(g = \{ {g_j}\} _{j = 0}^\infty \in {l_\infty }\); the kernel of the equation is an arithmetic probability distribution generating a random walk drifting to +∞. We prove that the previously obtained formula for the Wiener-Hopf equation with general arithmetic kernel for g ∈ l1 is a solution to the equation for g ∈ l∞ and that successive approximations converge to the solution. The asymptotics of the solution is established in the following cases with account taken of their peculiarities: (1) g ∈ l1; (2) g ∈ l∞; (3) gj → const as j → ∞; (4) g ∉ l1 and gj ↓ 0 as j → ∞.,M. S.

0,Geometry on Probability Spaces,"Partial differential equations and the Laplacian operator on domains in Euclidean spaces have played a central role in understanding natural phenomena. However, this avenue has been limited in many areas where calculus is obstructed, as in singular spaces, and in function spaces of functions on a space X where X itself is a function space. Examples of the latter occur in vision and quantum field theory. In vision it would be useful to do analysis on the space of images and an image is a function on a patch. Moreover, in analysis and geometry, the Lebesgue measure and its counterpart on manifolds are central. These measures are unavailable in the vision example and even in learning theory in general.There is one situation where, in the last several decades, the problem has been studied with some success. That is when the underlying space is finite (or even discrete). The introduction of the graph Laplacian has been a major development in algorithm research and is certainly useful for unsupervised learning theory.The approach taken here is to take advantage of both the classical research and the newer graph theoretic ideas to develop geometry on probability spaces. This starts with a space X equipped with a kernel (like a Mercer kernel) which gives a topology and geometry; X is to be equipped as well with a probability measure. The main focus is on a construction of a (normalized) Laplacian, an associated heat equation, diffusion distance, etc. In this setting, the point estimates of calculus are replaced by integral quantities. One thinks of secants rather than tangents. Our main result bounds the error of an empirical approximation to this Laplacian on X.",Steve Smale1 & Ding-Xuan Zhou,Constructive Approximation,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00365-009-9070-2,"Learning theory,Reproducing kernel Hilbert space,Graph Laplacian,Dimensionality reduction,Integral operator"
0,On Threshold Probability for the Stability of Independent Sets in Distance Graphs,"This paper considers the so-called distance graph G(n, r, s);its vertices can be identified with the r-element subsets of the set {1, 2,…,n}, and two vertices are joined by an edge if the size of the intersection of the corresponding subsets equals s. Note that, in the case s = 0, such graphs are known as Kneser graphs. These graphs are closely related to the Erdős-Ko-Rado problem; they also play an important role in combinatorial geometry and coding theory.We study properties of random subgraphs of the graph G(n, r, s) in the Erdős-Rényi model, in which each edge is included in the subgraph with a certain fixed probability p independently of the other edges. It is known that if r > 2s + 1, then, for p = 1/2, the size of an independent set is asymptotically stable in the sense that the independence number of a random subgraph is asymptotically equal to that of the initial graph G(n, r, s). This gives rise to the question of how small p must be for asymptotic stability to cease. The main result of this paper is the answer to this question.","M. M.

A mathematical model of neuronal arborizations may be useful to extract basic parameters or organization rules, hence helping to achieve a better understanding of the underlying growth processes.We present a parsimonious statistical model, intended to describe the topological organization of neuritic arborizations with a minimal number of parameters. It is based on a probability of splitting which depends only on the centrifugal order of segments. We compare the predictions made by the model of several topological properties of neurones with the corresponding actual values measured on a sample of honeybee (olfactory) antennal lobe neurones grown in primary culture, described in a previous study. The comparison is performed for three populations of segments corresponding to three neuronal morphological types previously identified and described in this sample. We show that simple assumptions together with the knowledge of a very small number of parameters allow the topological reconstruction of representative (bi-dimensional) biological neurones. We discuss the biological significance (in terms of possible factors involved in the determinism of neuronal types) of both common properties and cell-type specific features, observed on the neurones and predicted by the model.","J.

0,Disease Emergence in Multi-Patch Stochastic Epidemic Models with Demographic and Seasonal Variability,"Factors such as seasonality and spatial connectivity affect the spread of an infectious disease. Accounting for these factors in infectious disease models provides useful information on the times and locations of greatest risk for disease outbreaks. In this investigation, stochastic multi-patch epidemic models are formulated with seasonal and demographic variability. The stochastic models are used to investigate the probability of a disease outbreak when infected individuals are introduced into one or more of the patches. Seasonal variation is included through periodic transmission and dispersal rates. Multi-type branching process approximation and application of the backward Kolmogorov differential equation lead to an estimate for the probability of a disease outbreak. This estimate is also periodic and depends on the time, the location, and the number of initial infected individuals introduced into the patch system as well as the magnitude of the transmission and dispersal rates and the connectivity between patches. Examples are given for seasonal transmission and dispersal in two and three patches.","Kaniz Fatema Nipa

In this paper, we formalise two analytic approaches for obtaining probability densities of individual branch lengths of phylogenetic trees generated by the Yule model. These methods are flexible and permit various aspects of the trees produced by Yule models to be investigated. One of our methods is applicable to a broader class of evolutionary processes, namely the Bellman–Harris models. Our methods have many practical applications including biodiversity and conservation related problems. In this setting the methods can be used to characterise the expected rate of biodiversity loss for Yule trees, as well as the expected gain of including the phylogeny in conservation management.

This bound is tight up to the constant c and addresses a question of Gowers on the number of irregular pairs in Szemerédi’s regularity lemma. In order to gain some control over irregular pairs, another regularity lemma, known as the strong regularity lemma, was developed by Alon, Fischer, Krivelevich, and Szegedy. For this lemma, we prove a lower bound of wowzer-type, which is one level higher in the Ackermann hierarchy than the tower function, on the number of parts in the strong regularity lemma, essentially matching the upper bound. On the other hand, for the induced graph removal lemma, the standard application of the strong regularity lemma, we find a different proof which yields a tower-type bound. We also discuss bounds on several related regularity lemmas, including the weak regularity lemma of Frieze and Kannan and the recently established regular approximation theorem.

0,A biased random key genetic algorithm applied to the electric distribution network reconfiguration problem,"This work presents a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) to solve the electric distribution network reconfiguration problem (DNR). The DNR is one of the most studied combinatorial optimization problems in power system analysis. Given a set of switches of an electric network that can be opened or closed, the objective is to select the best configuration of the switches to optimize a given network objective while at the same time satisfying a set of operational constraints. The good performance of BRKGAs on many combinatorial optimization problems and the fact that it has never been applied to solve DNR problems are the main motivation for this research. A BRKGA is a variant of random-key genetic algorithms, where one of the parents used for mating is biased to be of higher fitness than the other parent. Solutions are encoded by using random keys, which are represented as vectors of real numbers in the interval (0,1), thus enabling an indirect search of the solution inside a proprietary search space. The genetic operators do not need to be modified to generate only feasible solutions, which is an exclusive task of the decoder of the problem. Tests were performed on standard distribution systems used in DNR studies found in the technical literature and the performance and robustness of the BRKGA were compared with other GA implementations.","H. de Faria Jr.

0,Sequential nonlinear estimation: regularized particle filter applied to the attitude estimation problem with real data,"The aim of this work is to analyze the robustness and computational effort of particle filter when applied to the attitude and gyro bias estimation problem. The particle filter is based on the sampling method for sequential importance, in which the basic idea is to represent the density function posteriori by a set of random samples (particles) associated with their respective weights. However, after a few interactions, degeneration of particles may occur. To avoid degeneration, the regularized version of the particle filter was applied. In such estimator, the particles with lower weight are discarded and those with greater weight give rise to new particles close to the areas of the highest probability. For analysis, the attitude dynamical model is described by quaternions, and the observation vector, composed by real data of attitude sensors that are on board the CBERS-2 (China–Brazil Earth Resource Satellite). The attitude sensors available are digital sun sensor, infrared Earth sensor, and mechanical gyros. The attitude and bias of gyro estimated by the regularized particle filter are compared with the unscented Kalman filter and the results show that for systems that do not have a high degree of nonlinearity, and under consideration of real data, the unscented Kalman filter has shown better performance than the regularized particle filter.","R.

0,Detection Thresholds in Very Sparse Matrix Completion,"We study the matrix completion problem: an underlying \(m \times n\) matrix P is low rank, with incoherent singular vectors, and a random \(m \times n\) matrix A is equal to P on a (uniformly) random subset of entries of size dn. All other entries of A are equal to zero. The goal is to retrieve information on P from the observation of A. Let \(A_1\) be the random matrix where each entry of A is multiplied by an independent \(\{0,1\}\)-Bernoulli random variable with parameter 1/2. This paper is about when, how and why the non-Hermitian eigen-spectra of the matrices \(A_1 (A - A_1)^*\) and \((A-A_1)^*A_1\) captures more of the relevant information about the principal component structure of A than the eigen-spectra of \(A A^*\) and \(A^* A\). We show that the eigenvalues of the asymmetric matrices \(A_{1} (A - A_{1})^{*}\) and \((A-A_{1})^{*} A_{1}\) with modulus greater than a detection threshold are asymptotically equal to the eigenvalues of \(PP^*\) and \(P^*P\) and that the associated eigenvectors are aligned as well. The central surprise is that by intentionally inducing asymmetry and additional randomness via the \(A_1\) matrix, we can extract more information than if we had worked with the singular value decomposition (SVD) of A. The associated detection threshold is asymptotically exact and is non-universal since it explicitly depends on the element-wise distribution of the underlying matrix P. We show that reliable, statistically optimal but not perfect matrix recovery, via a universal data-driven algorithm, is possible above this detection threshold using the information extracted from the asymmetric eigen-decompositions. Averaging the left and right eigenvectors provably improves estimation accuracy but not the detection threshold. Our results encompass the very sparse regime where d is of order 1 where matrix completion via the SVD of A fails or produces unreliable recovery. We define another variant of this asymmetric principal component analysis procedure that bypasses the randomization step and has a detection threshold that is smaller by a constant factor but with a computational cost that is larger by a polynomial factor of the number of observed entries. Both detection thresholds allow to go beyond the barrier due to the well-known information theoretical limit \(d \asymp \log n\) for exact matrix completion found in the literature.","Charles Bordenave1, Simon Coste2 & Raj Rao Nadakuditi",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-022-09568-6,"Matrix completion,Sparse random graphs,Eigenvalues,Spectral algorithms,Non-Hermitian matrices"
0,Network-inspired versus Kozeny–Carman based permeability-porosity relations applied to Biot’s poroelasticity model,"Water injection in the aquifer induces deformations in the soil. These mechanical deformations give rise to a change in porosity and permeability, which results in non-linearity of the mathematical problem. Assuming that the deformations are very small, the model provided by Biot’s theory of linear poroelasticity is used to determine the local displacement of the skeleton of a porous medium, as well as the fluid flow through the pores. In this continuum scale model, the Kozeny–Carman equation is commonly used to determine the permeability of the porous medium from the porosity. The Kozeny–Carman relation states that flow through the pores is possible at a certain location as long as the porosity is larger than zero at this location in the aquifer. However, from network models it is known that percolation thresholds exist, indicating that the permeability will be equal to zero if the porosity becomes smaller than these thresholds. In this paper, the relationship between permeability and porosity is investigated. A new permeability-porosity relation, based on the percolation theory, is derived and compared with the Kozeny–Carman relation. The strongest feature of the new approach is related to its capability to give a good description of the permeability in case of low porosities. However, with this network-inspired approach small values of the permeability are more likely to occur. Since we show that the solution of Biot’s model converges to the solution of a saddle point problem for small time steps and low permeability, we need stabilisation in the finite element approximation.","Menel Rahrah

Of course, this is not possible within the bounds of the Kolmogorov axioms, and we have to violate at least one axiom. We define a probability measure as a finitely additive measure assigning probability 1 to the whole space, on a domain which is closed under complements and finite disjoint unions. We introduce and motivate a notion of uniformity which we call weak thinnability, which is strictly stronger than extension of natural density. We construct a weakly thinnable probability measure, and we show that on its domain, which contains sets without natural density, probability is uniquely determined by weak thinnability. In this sense, we can assign uniform probabilities in a canonical way. We generalize this result to uniform probability measures on other metric spaces, including \({\mathbb {R}}^n\).",Timber Kerkvliet1 & Ronald Meester,Journal of Theoretical Probability,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10959-015-0611-2,"Uniform probability,Foundations of probability,Kolmogorov axioms,Finite additivity"
0,Spectral Graph Matching and Regularized Quadratic Relaxations I Algorithm and Gaussian Analysis,"Graph matching aims at finding the vertex correspondence between two unlabeled graphs that maximizes the total edge weight correlation. This amounts to solving a computationally intractable quadratic assignment problem. In this paper, we propose a new spectral method, graph matching by pairwise eigen-alignments (GRAMPA). Departing from prior spectral approaches that only compare top eigenvectors, or eigenvectors of the same order, GRAMPA first constructs a similarity matrix as a weighted sum of outer products between all pairs of eigenvectors of the two graphs, with weights given by a Cauchy kernel applied to the separation of the corresponding eigenvalues, then outputs a matching by a simple rounding procedure. The similarity matrix can also be interpreted as the solution to a regularized quadratic programming relaxation of the quadratic assignment problem. For the Gaussian Wigner model in which two complete graphs on n vertices have Gaussian edge weights with correlation coefficient \(1-\sigma ^2\), we show that GRAMPA exactly recovers the correct vertex correspondence with high probability when \(\sigma = O(\frac{1}{\log n})\). This matches the state of the art of polynomial-time algorithms and significantly improves over existing spectral methods which require \(\sigma \) to be polynomially small in n. The superiority of GRAMPA is also demonstrated on a variety of synthetic and real datasets, in terms of both statistical accuracy and computational efficiency. Universality results, including similar guarantees for dense and sparse Erdős–Rényi graphs, are deferred to a companion paper.","Zhou Fan1, Cheng Mao2, Yihong Wu1 & …Jiaming Xu",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-022-09570-y,"Graph matching,Quadratic assignment problem,Spectral methods,Convex relaxations,Quadratic programming,Random matrix theory"

0,Adaptive gene introgression after secondary contact,"By hybridization and backcrossing, alleles can surmount species boundaries and be incorporated into the genome of a related species. This introgression of genes is of particular evolutionary relevance if it involves the transfer of adaptations between populations. However, any beneficial allele will typically be associated with other alien alleles that are often deleterious and hamper the introgression process. In order to describe the introgression of an adaptive allele, we set up a stochastic model with an explicit genetic makeup of linked and unlinked deleterious alleles. Based on the theory of reducible multitype branching processes, we derive a recursive expression for the establishment probability of the beneficial allele after a single hybridization event. We furthermore study the probability that slightly deleterious alleles hitchhike to fixation. The key to the analysis is a split of the process into a stochastic phase in which the advantageous alleles establishes and a deterministic phase in which it sweeps to fixation. We thereafter apply the theory to a set of biologically relevant scenarios such as introgression in the presence of many unlinked or few closely linked deleterious alleles. A comparison to computer simulations shows that the approximations work well over a large parameter range.","Hildegard Uecker1,2, Derek Setter3 & Joachim Hermisson",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-014-0802-y,"Branching processes,Gene introgression,Adaptation,Hybridization,Genetic hitchhiking"

            ","A 3-manifold is Haken if it contains a topologically essential surface. The Virtual Haken Conjecture posits that every irreducible 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group has a finite cover which is Haken. In this paper, we study random 3-manifolds and their finite covers in an attempt to shed light on this difficult question. In particular, we consider random Heegaard splittings by gluing two handlebodies by the result of a random walk in the mapping class group of a surface. For this model of random 3-manifold, we are able to compute the probabilities that the resulting manifolds have finite covers of particular kinds. Our results contrast with the analogous probabilities for groups coming from random balanced presentations, giving quantitative theorems to the effect that 3-manifold groups have many more finite quotients than random groups. The next natural question is whether these covers have positive betti number. For abelian covers of a fixed type over 3-manifolds of Heegaard genus 2, we show that the probability of positive betti number is 0.In fact, many of these questions boil down to questions about the mapping class group. We are led to consider the action of the mapping class group of a surface Σ on the set of quotients π1(Σ)→Q. If Q is a simple group, we show that if the genus of Σ is large, then this action is very mixing. In particular, the action factors through the alternating group of each orbit. This is analogous to Goldman’s theorem that the action of the mapping class group on the SU(2) character variety is ergodic. ",Nathan M. Dunfield1 & William P.

0,Population extinction and quasi-stationary behavior in stochastic density-dependent structured models,"Density-independent and density-dependent, stochastic and deterministic, discrete-time, structured models are formulated, analysed and numerically simulated. A special case of the deterministic, density-independent, structured model is the well-known Leslie age-structured model. The stochastic, density-independent model is a multitype branching process. A review of linear, density-independent models is given first, then nonlinear, density-dependent models are discussed.In the linear, density-independent structured models, transitions between states are independent of time and state. Population extinction is determined by the dominant eigenvalue λ of the transition matrix. If λ ≤ 1, then extinction occurs with probability one in the stochastic and deterministic models. However, if λ > 1, then the deterministic model has exponential growth, but in the stochastic model there is a positive probability of extinction which depends on the fixed point of the system of probability generating functions.The linear, density-independent, stochastic model is generalized to a nonlinear, density-dependent one. The dependence on state is in terms of a weighted total population size. It is shown for small initial population sizes that the density-dependent, stochastic model can be approximated by the density-independent, stochastic model and thus, the extinction behavior exhibited by the linear model occurs in the nonlinear model. In the deterministic models there is a unique stable equilibrium. Given the population does not go extinct, it is shown that the stochastic model has a quasi-stationary distribution with mean close to the stable equilibrium, provided the population size is sufficiently large. For small values of the population size, complete extinction can be observed in the simulations. However, the persistence time increases rapidly with the population size.",Garry L. Block1 & Linda J.

2 as \(n\to\infty\), where B is a finite positive constant. This in turn implies that the survival probability at time n (i.e., the probability that the origin is connected to the hyperplane at time n) decays like 1/Bn as \(n\to\infty\). The latter has been shown in an earlier paper to have consequences for the geometry of large critical clusters and for the incipient infinite cluster. The present paper is Part I in a series of two papers. In Part II, we derive a lace expansion for the survival probability, adapted so as to deal with point-to-plane connections.

One collects previous cases, called “scenarios”, for the set-up in which optimization is being performed, and makes a decision that is optimal for the cases that have been collected. For convex optimization, a solid theory has been developed that provides guarantees of performance, and constraint satisfaction, of the scenario solution. In this paper, we open a new direction of investigation: the risk that a performance is not achieved, or that constraints are violated, is studied jointly with the complexity (as precisely defined in the paper) of the solution. It is shown that the joint probability distribution of risk and complexity is concentrated in such a way that the complexity carries fundamental information to tightly judge the risk. This result is obtained without requiring extra knowledge on the underlying optimization problem than that carried by the scenarios; in particular, no extra knowledge on the distribution by which scenarios are generated is assumed, so that the result is broadly applicable. This deep-seated result unveils a fundamental and general structure of data-driven optimization and suggests practical approaches for risk assessment.","S. Garatti

0,Distances Between σ-Fields on a Probability Space,"For a probability space (Ω,ℱ,P) and two sub-σ-fields

\(\rho(\mathcal{B},\mathcal{A})=\sup_{B\in\mathcal{B}}\inf_{A\in\mathcal{A}}P(A\triangle B)\) 
and 
\(\overline{\rho}(\mathcal{B},\mathcal{A})=\sup_{B\in\mathcal{B}}\inf_{A\in\mathcal{A},A\supset B}P(A\setminus B)\)

0,Effect of Population Partitioning on the Probability of Silent Circulation of Poliovirus,"Polio can circulate unobserved in regions that are challenging to monitor. To assess the probability of silent circulation, simulation models can be used to understand transmission dynamics when detection is unreliable. Model assumptions, however, impact the estimated probability of silent circulation. Here, we examine the impact of having distinct populations, rather than a single well-mixed population, with a discrete-individual model including environmental surveillance. We show that partitioning a well-mixed population into networks of distinct communities may result in a higher probability of silent circulation as a result of the time it takes for the detection of a circulation event. Population structure should be considered when assessing polio control in a region with many loosely interacting communities.","Celeste Vallejo

0,A Note on the Derivation of Epidemic Final Sizes,"Final size relations are known for many epidemic models. The derivations are often tedious and difficult, involving indirect methods to solve a system of integro-differential equations. Often when the details of the disease or population change, the final size relation does not. An alternate approach to deriving final sizes has been suggested. This approach directly considers the underlying stochastic process of the epidemic rather than the approximating deterministic equations and gives insight into why the relations hold. It has not been widely used. We suspect that this is because it appears to be less rigorous. In this article, we investigate this approach more fully and show that under very weak assumptions (which are satisfied in all conditions we are aware of for which final size relations exist) it can be made rigorous. In particular, the assumptions must hold whenever integro-differential equations exist, but they may also hold in cases without such equations. Thus, the use of integro-differential equations to find a final size relation is unnecessary and a simpler, more general method can be applied.",Joel C.

0,Monte Carlo methods,"Monte Carlo methods deal with generating random variates from probability density functions in order to estimate unknown parameters or general functions of unknown parameters and to compute their expected values, variances and covariances. One generally works with the multivariate normal distribution due to the central limit theorem. However, if random variables with the normal distribution and random variables with a different distribution are combined, the normal distribution is not valid anymore. The Monte Carlo method is then needed to get the expected values, variances and covariances for the random variables with distributions different from the normal distribution. The error propagation by Monte Carlo methods is discussed and methods for generating random variates from the multivariate normal distribution and from the multivariate uniform distribution. The Monte Carlo integration is presented leading to the sampling–importance-resampling algorithm. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods provide by the Metropolis algorithm and the Gibbs sampler additional ways of generating random variates. A special topic is the Gibbs sampler for computing and propagating large covariance matrices. This task arises, for instance, when the geopotential is determined from satellite observations. The example of the minimal detectable outlier shows, how the Monte Carlo method is used to determine the power of a hypothesis test.",Karl-Rudolf Koch,GEM - International Journal on Geomathematics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13137-017-0101-z,"Bayesian statistics,SIR algorithm,Metropolis algorithm,Gibbs sampler,Markov chain Monte Carlo methods"
0,A blackbox yield estimation workflow with Gaussian process regression applied to the design of electromagnetic devices,"In this paper an efficient and reliable method for stochastic yield estimation is presented. Since one main challenge of uncertainty quantification is the computational feasibility, we propose a hybrid approach where most of the Monte Carlo sample points are evaluated with a surrogate model, and only a few sample points are reevaluated with the original high fidelity model. Gaussian process regression is a non-intrusive method which is used to build the surrogate model. Without many prerequisites, this gives us not only an approximation of the function value, but also an error indicator that we can use to decide whether a sample point should be reevaluated or not. For two benchmark problems, a dielectrical waveguide and a lowpass filter, the proposed methods outperform classic approaches.","Mona Fuhrländer

0,First-order sensitivity of the optimal value in a Markov decision model with respect to deviations in the transition probability function,"Markov decision models (MDM) used in practical applications are most often less complex than the underlying ‘true’ MDM. The reduction of model complexity is performed for several reasons. However, it is obviously of interest to know what kind of model reduction is reasonable (in regard to the optimal value) and what kind is not. In this article we propose a way how to address this question. We introduce a sort of derivative of the optimal value as a function of the transition probabilities, which can be used to measure the (first-order) sensitivity of the optimal value w.r.t. changes in the transition probabilities. ‘Differentiability’ is obtained for a fairly broad class of MDMs, and the ‘derivative’ is specified explicitly. Our theoretical findings are illustrated by means of optimization problems in inventory control and mathematical finance.

0,The Probability of Extinction of Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus in One and Two Patches,"Single-type and multitype branching processes have been used to study the dynamics of a variety of stochastic birth–death type phenomena in biology and physics. Their use in epidemiology goes back to Whittle’s study of a susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) model in the 1950s. In the case of an SIR model, the presence of only one infectious class allows for the use of single-type branching processes. Multitype branching processes allow for multiple infectious classes and have latterly been used to study metapopulation models of disease. In this article, we develop a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) model of infectious salmon anemia virus in two patches, two CTMC models in one patch and companion multitype branching process (MTBP) models. The CTMC models are related to deterministic models which inform the choice of parameters. The probability of extinction is computed for the CTMC via numerical methods and approximated by the MTBP in the supercritical regime. The stochastic models are treated as toy models, and the parameter choices are made to highlight regions of the parameter space where CTMC and MTBP agree or disagree, without regard to biological significance. Partial extinction events are defined and their relevance discussed. A case is made for calculating the probability of such events, noting that MTBPs are not suitable for making these calculations.","Evan Milliken

We study the distribution of probabilities of equality\( a_{1}a_{2}\cdots a_{n-1}a_{n}=a_{\pi _{1}}^{\epsilon _{1} }a_{\pi _{2}}^{\epsilon _{2}}\cdots a_{\pi _{n-1}}^{\epsilon _{n-1}}a_{\pi _{n} }^{\epsilon _{n}},\) when \(\pi \) varies over all the permutations in \(S_{n}\), and \(\epsilon _{i}\) varies over the set \(\{+1, -1\}\). By [7], the case where all \(\epsilon _{i}\) are \(+1\) led to a close connection to Hultman numbers. In this paper, we generalize the results, permitting \(\epsilon _{i}\) to be \(-1\). We describe the spectrum of the probabilities of signed permutation equalities in a finite group G. This spectrum turns out to be closely related to the partition of \(2^{n}\cdot n!\) into a sum of the corresponding signed Hultman numbers.

0,Minimizing the Probability of Lifetime Exponential Parisian Ruin,"We find the optimal investment strategy in a Black–Scholes market to minimize the probability of so-called lifetime exponential Parisian ruin, that is, the probability that wealth exhibits an excursion below zero of an exponentially distributed time before the individual dies. We find that leveraging the risky asset is worse for negative wealth when minimizing the probability of lifetime exponential Parisian ruin than when minimizing the probability of lifetime ruin. Moreover, when wealth is negative, the optimal amount invested in the risky asset increases as the hazard rate of the exponential “excursion clock” increases. In view of the heavy leveraging when wealth is negative, we also compute the minimum probability of lifetime exponential Parisian ruin under a constraint on investment. Finally, we derive an asymptotic expansion of the minimum probability of lifetime exponential Parisian ruin for small values of the hazard rate of the excursion clock. It is interesting to find that for small values of this hazard rate, the minimum probability of lifetime exponential Parisian ruin is proportional to the minimum occupation time studied in Bayraktar and Young, and the proportion equals the hazard rate. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to control the probability of Parisian ruin.",Xiaoqing Liang1 & Virginia R.

0,Robust Group Synchronization via Cycle-Edge Message Passing,"We propose a general framework for solving the group synchronization problem, where we focus on the setting of adversarial or uniform corruption and sufficiently small noise. Specifically, we apply a novel message passing procedure that uses cycle consistency information in order to estimate the corruption levels of group ratios and consequently solve the synchronization problem in our setting. We first explain why the group cycle consistency information is essential for effectively solving group synchronization problems. We then establish exact recovery and linear convergence guarantees for the proposed message passing procedure under a deterministic setting with adversarial corruption. These guarantees hold as long as the ratio of corrupted cycles per edge is bounded by a reasonable constant. We also establish the stability of the proposed procedure to sub-Gaussian noise. We further establish exact recovery with high probability under a common uniform corruption model.

0,Multiple attribute decision making based on immediate probabilities aggregation operators for single-valued and interval neutrosophic sets,"The objective of this paper is to present novel algorithms for solving the multiple attribute decision-making problems under the neutrosophic set environment. Single-valued and interval neutrosophic sets are the important mechanisms for directing the decision-making queries with unknown and indeterminant data by employing a degree of “acceptance”, “indeterminacy”, and “non-acceptance” in quantitative terms. Also, to describe the behavior of the decision-maker objectively (in terms of probability) and subjectively (in terms of weights), a concept of probabilistic information plays a dominant role in the investigation. Keeping these features in mind, this paper presents several probabilistic and immediate probability-based averaging and geometric aggregation operators for the collection of the single-valued and interval neutrosophic sets. The advantage of these proposed operators is that it simultaneously combines the objective and subjective behavior of the decision-maker during the process. The various salient features of the proposed operators are studied. Later, we develop two new algorithms based on the aggregation operators to solve multiple attribute decision-making problems with single-valued and interval neutrosophic sets features.

0,Modelling election dynamics and the impact of disinformation,"Complex dynamical systems driven by the unravelling of information can be modelled effectively by treating the underlying flow of information as the model input.

Such an information-based approach is in sharp contrast to the conventional mathematical modelling of information-driven systems whereby one attempts to come up with essentially ad hoc models for the outputs. Here, dynamics of electoral competition is modelled by the specification of the flow of information relevant to election. The seemingly random evolution of the election poll statistics are then derived as model outputs, which in turn are used to study election prediction, impact of disinformation, and the optimal strategy for information management in an election campaign.","Dorje C.

As corollaries we derive extensions of earlier results of Dubins and Freedman;(17) Yahav;(30) and Bhattacharya and Lee(6) for monotone maps. The general theorem applies in other contexts as well. It is also shown that the Dubins–Freedman result on the “necessity” of splitting in the case of increasing maps does not hold for decreasing maps, although the sufficiency part holds for both. In addition, the asymptotic stationarity of the process generated by i.i.d. nondecreasing maps is established without the requirement of continuity.

0,Quantum mechanics as a deterministic theory of a continuum of worlds,"A non-relativistic quantum mechanical theory is proposed that describes the universe as a continuum of worlds whose mutual interference gives rise to quantum phenomena. A logical framework is introduced to properly deal with propositions about objects in a multiplicity of worlds. In this logical framework, the continuum of worlds is treated in analogy to the continuum of time points; both “time” and “world” are considered as mutually independent modes of existence. The theory combines elements of Bohmian mechanics and of Everett’s many-worlds interpretation; it has a clear ontology and a set of precisely defined postulates from where the predictions of standard quantum mechanics can be derived. Probability as given by the Born rule emerges as a consequence of insufficient knowledge of observers about which world it is that they live in. The theory describes a continuum of worlds rather than a single world or a discrete set of worlds, so it is similar in spirit to many-worlds interpretations based on Everett’s approach, without being actually reducible to these. In particular, there is no splitting of worlds, which is a typical feature of Everett-type theories. Altogether, the theory explains (1) the subjective occurrence of probabilities, (2) their quantitative value as given by the Born rule, and (3) the apparently random “collapse of the wavefunction” caused by the measurement, while still being an objectively deterministic theory.","Kim Joris Boström

A formula that expresses the randomness deficiency in terms of prefix complexity is given (in two forms). Some approaches that go in another direction (from deficiency to complexity) are considered. The notion of Bernoulli randomness (independent coin tosses for an asymmetric coin with some probability p of head) is defined. It is shown that a sequence is Bernoulli if it is random with respect to some Bernoulli measure B

0,A stochastic automata network descriptor for Markov chain models of instantaneously coupled intracellular Ca2+ channels,"Although there is consensus that localized Ca2+ elevations known as Ca2+ puffs and sparks arise from the cooperative activity of intracellular Ca2+ channels, the precise relationship between single-channel kinetics and the collective phenomena of stochastic Ca2+ excitability is not well understood. Here we present a formalism by which mathematical models for Ca2+-regulated Ca2+ release sites are derived from stochastic models of single-channel gating that include Ca2+ activation, Ca2+ inactivation, or both. Such models are stochastic automata networks (SANs) that involve a large number of functional transitions, that is, the transition probabilities of the infinitesimal generator matrix of one of the automata (i.e., an individual channel) may depend on the local [Ca2+] and thus the state of the other channels. Simulation and analysis of the SAN descriptors representing homogeneous clusters of intracellular Ca2+ channels show that (1) release site density can modify both the steady-state open probability and stochastic excitability of Ca2+ release sites, (2) Ca2+ inactivation is not a requirement for Ca2+ puffs or sparks, and (3) a single-channel model with a bell-shaped open probability curve does not lead to release site activity that is a biphasic function of release site density. These findings are obtained using iterative, memory-efficient methods (novel in this biophysical context and distinct from Monte Carlo simulation) that leverage the highly structured SAN descriptor to unambiguously calculate the steady-state probability of each release site configuration and puff statistics such as puff duration and inter-puff interval. The validity of a mean field approximation that neglects the spatial organization of Ca2+ release sites is also discussed.","Vien Nguyen1, Roy Mathias2 & Gregory D.

0,"Theory of evidence — A survey of its mathematical foundations, applications and computational aspects","The mathematical theory of evidence has been introduced by Glenn Shafer in 1976 as a new approach to the representation of uncertainty. This theory can be represented under several distinct but more or less equivalent forms. Probabilistic interpretations of evidence theory have their roots in Arthur Dempster's multivalued mappings of probability spaces. This leads to random set and more generally to random filter models of evidence. In this probabilistic view evidence is seen as more or less probable arguments for certain hypotheses and they can be used to support those hypotheses to certain degrees. These degrees of support are in fact the reliabilities with which the hypotheses can be derived from the evidence. Alternatively, the mathematical theory of evidence can be founded axiomatically on the notion of belief functions or on the allocation of belief masses to subsets of a frame of discernment. These approaches aim to present evidence theory as an extension of probability theory. Evidence theory has been used to represent uncertainty in expert systems, especially in the domain of diagnostics. It can be applied to decision analysis and it gives a new perspective for statistical analysis. Among its further applications are image processing, project planning and scheduling and risk analysis. The computational problems of evidence theory are well understood and even though the problem is complex, efficient methods are available.",Jürg Kohlas1 & Paul-André Monney,Zeitschrift für Operations Research,1994,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01440734,"Uncertainty,Evidence,Dempster-Shafer Theory,Belief Functions"

0,Computation of credit portfolio loss distribution by a cross entropy method,"Quantification and management of credit risk is always crucial for the financial industry. Computing credit risk is generally a challenging task while correlated defaults exist. Traditional approaches such as exponential twisting are model specific and often involve difficult analysis, therefore computational methods are sought to estimate the credit risk when analysis is unavailable. The accurate measurement of credit risk is often a rare-event simulation problem, i.e., calculating probabilities (which are usually small) of extreme losses. It is well-known that the Monte Carlo (MC) method may become slow and expensive for such problems. Importance sampling (IS), a variance-reduction technique, can then be utilized for rare-event simulation for credit risk management. In this work, we propose the implementation of a special IS procedure, the cross-entropy (CE) method, to simulate credit risk models. More specifically, we obtain iteratively biasing probability density functions (PDF’s) for credit portfolio losses by the CE method, and then combine the results from each stage by the technique of multiple importance sampling to obtain a complete PDF. The main advantage of this method is that it can avoid the nontrivial analysis required by a general IS method, and therefore simplifies the estimation of loss distributions. Moreover, this approach is generic and can be applied to a wide variety of models with little modifications. In particular, we apply this approach to a normal copula model and a t-copula model to estimate the probabilities of extreme portfolio losses under the models.

0,Predicting RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots by MCMC sampling,"The most probable secondary structure of an RNA molecule, given the nucleotide sequence, can be computed efficiently if a stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) is used as the prior distribution of the secondary structure. The structures of some RNA molecules contain so-called pseudoknots. Allowing all possible configurations of pseudoknots is not compatible with context-free grammar models and makes the search for an optimal secondary structure NP-complete. We suggest a probabilistic model for RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots and present a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo Method for sampling RNA structures according to their posterior distribution for a given sequence. We favor Bayesian sampling over optimization methods in this context, because it makes the uncertainty of RNA structure predictions assessable.

0,A Random Walk Approach to Transport in Tissues and Complex Media: From Microscale Descriptions to Macroscale Models,"The biological processes necessary for the development and continued survival of any organism are often strongly influenced by the transport properties of various biologically active species. The transport phenomena involved vary over multiple temporal and spatial scales, from organism-level behaviors such as the search for food, to systemic processes such as the transport of oxygen from the lungs to distant organs, down to microscopic phenomena such as the stochastic movement of proteins in a cell. Each of these processes is influenced by many interrelated factors. Identifying which factors are the most important, and how they interact to determine the overall result is a problem of great importance and interest. Experimental observations are often fit to relatively simple models, but in reality the observations are the output of complicated functions of the physicochemical, topological, and geometrical properties of a given system. Herein we use multistate continuous-time random walks and generalized master equations to model transport processes involving spatial jumps, immobilization at defined sites, and stochastic internal state changes. The underlying spatial models, which are framed as graphs, may have different classes of nodes, and walkers may have internal states that are governed by a Markov process. A general form of the solutions, using Fourier–Laplace transforms and asymptotic analysis, is developed for several spatially infinite regular lattices in one and two spatial dimensions, and the theory is developed for the analysis of transport and internal state changes on general graphs. The goal in each case is to shed light on how experimentally observable macroscale transport coefficients can be explained in terms of microscale properties of the underlying processes. This work is motivated by problems arising in transport in biological tissues, but the results are applicable to a broad class of problems that arise in other applications.","Jay A.

In this paper, we present a bilevel programming formulation for the problem of strategic bidding under uncertainty in a wholesale energy market (WEM), where the economic remuneration of each generator depends on the ability of its own management to submit price and quantity bids. The leader of the bilevel problem consists of one among a group of competing generators and the follower is the electric system operator. The capability of the agent represented by the leader to affect the market price is considered by the model. We propose two solution approaches for this non-convex problem. The first one is a heuristic procedure whose efficiency is confirmed through comparisons with the optimal solutions for some instances of the problem. These optimal solutions are obtained by the second approach proposed, which consists of a mixed integer reformulation of the bilevel model. The heuristic proposed is also compared to standard solvers for nonlinearly constrained optimization problems. The application of the procedures is illustrated in case studies with configurations derived from the Brazilian power system.

0,A regularity theorem for quasilinear parabolic systems under random perturbations,"Several aspects of regularity theory for parabolic systems are investigated under the effect of random perturbations. The deterministic theory, when strict parabolicity is assumed, presents both classes of systems where all weak solutions are in fact more regular, and examples of systems with weak solutions which develop singularities in finite time. Our main result is the extension of a regularity result due to Kalita to the stochastic case, which concerns local Hölder continuity of weak solutions in the vectorial case. For the proof, we apply stochastic versions of methods, which are classical in the deterministic case (such as difference quotient techniques, higher integrability by embedding theorems, and a version of Moser’s iteration technique).

The usual strict convexity assumption on the market-price to strike-price function is relaxed, provided one is willing to accept a partially supported risk-neutral density. This provides a natural and useful extension of the standard theory. We present a rigorous analysis of the related optimization problem via convex duality and constraint qualification on both bounded and unbounded price domains. The relevance of this work for applications is in explaining precisely the consequences of any gap between convexity and strict convexity in the price function.

We define polymer dynamics in \(1+1\) dimension as a stochastic gradient flow on polymers pinned at the origin, for energy involving quadratic nearest neighbor interaction and local interaction with random environment. We prove existence and uniqueness of the solution, continuity of the flow, the order-preserving property with respect to the coordinatewise partial order, and the invariance of the asymptotic slope. We establish ordering by noise which means that if two initial conditions have distinct slopes, then the associated solutions eventually get ordered coordinatewise. This, along with the shear-invariance property and existing results on static infinite volume polymer measures, allows to prove that for a fixed asymptotic slope and almost every realization of the environment, the polymer dynamics has a unique invariant distribution given by a unique infinite volume polymer measure, and, moreover, One Force—One Solution principle holds. We also prove that every polymer measure is concentrated on paths with well-defined asymptotic slopes and give an estimate on deviations from straight lines.","Yuri Bakhtin1 & Hong-Bin Chen

The studies in the field of collective recognition, which were started in the middle of the 1950s, find wide application in practice during the last decade. Since they are used for solving complex large-scale applied problems, the interest of both theoretical scientists and engineers is focused on them. A new impetus for the studies was given by the recent development of embedded distributed structures involving ensembles of intellectual sensors that make decisions under uncertainties on the base of limited local information. The final decision of high quality, in particular, the decision of higher aggregation level, is made by combining local classifier decisions on the metalevel.

The characterization results are related to the independence and equidistribution of linear forms of sample values, as well as to regression relations, admissibility, and optimality of statistical estimators. When calculating the Bahadur asymptotic efficiency, particular attention is paid to the logarithmic asymptotics of large deviation probabilities of test statistics under the null hypothesis.

0,The possible influence of the discovery of radio-active decay on the concept of physical probability,"
Brush has somewhat prosaically said that since the time of Fourier we have been confronted with an awareness that our knowledge of the physical world can at best be probable. It has become clear that as the world consists of such a large number of particles of various sorts moving about, only statistical descriptions can be justified. This approach, worked out amidst some confusion about the concepts of probability, relative frequency, and a priori equal probabilities62, was first developed in the field of statistical mechanics. More fundamental perhaps was the subsequent invention of the concept of a quantum of energy and “wavicles”. This has led to the theory of quantum mechanics and has induced most physicists and philosophers to repudiate physical causality. In this context, the statistical description of radioactivity was a relatively isolated development, concerned with experimental physics. In so far as a theoretical or conceptual analysis of the statistical character of radioactive decay was developed, it was analogous to prevailing concepts in the kinetic theory of gases, including the theory of chemical reaction. In the publications of physicists in the first third of this century, no support can be found for the hypothesis that the development of the theory of radioactive decay in itself contributed much to a changing concept of physical probability.",J. van Brakel,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,1985,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00348520,"Fourier,Quantum Mechanic,Relative Frequency,Statistical Mechanic,Statistical Character"

0,Combining variable neighborhood search and estimation of distribution algorithms in the protein side chain placement problem,"
The aim of this work is to introduce several proposals for combining two metaheuristics: variable neighborhood search (VNS) and estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). Although each of these metaheuristics has been previously hybridized in several ways, this paper constitutes the first attempt to combine both optimization methods.

The different ways of combining VNS and EDAs will be classified into three groups. In the first group, we will consider combinations where the philosophy underlying VNS is embedded in EDAs. Considering different neighborhood spaces (points, populations or probability distributions), we will obtain instantiations for the approaches in this group. The second group of algorithms is obtained when probabilistic models (or any other machine learning paradigm) are used in order to exploit the good and bad shakes of the randomly generated solutions in a reduced variable neighborhood search. The last group of algorithms contains the results of alternating VNS and EDAs.

An application of the first approach is presented in the protein side chain placement problem. The results obtained show the superiority of the hybrid algorithm in comparison with EDAs and VNS.

Here we study the probabilities of splits on gene trees under the multispecies coalescent model, and how their features might inform species tree inference. After investigating the behavior of split consensus methods, we investigate split invariants—that is, polynomial relationships between split probabilities. These invariants are then used to show that, even though a split is an unrooted notion, split probabilities retain enough information to identify the rooted species tree topology for trees of 5 or more taxa, with one possible 6-taxon exception.","Elizabeth S.

The discrete-time model is an especial case in modeling that satisfactorily describes the epidemiological dynamics because of the discrete nature of the real data. However, discrete models reduce their descriptive and fitting potential because of assuming a homogeneous population. Thus, in this paper, we proposed contagion probability functions according to two infection paradigms that consider factors associated with transmission dynamics. For example, we introduced probabilities of establishing an infectious interaction, the number of contacts with infectious and the level of connectivity or social distance within populations. Through the probabilities design, we overcame the homogeneity assumption. Also, we evaluated the proposed probabilities through their introduction into discrete-time models for two diseases and different study zones with real data, COVID-19 for Germany and South Korea, and dengue for Colombia. Also, we described the oscillatory dynamics for the last one using the contagion probabilities alongside parameters with a biological sense. Finally, we highlight the implementation of the proposed probabilities would improve the simulation of the public policy effect of control strategies over an infectious disease outbreak.","Alexandra Catano-Lopez

0,Scaling limits of loop-erased random walks and uniform spanning trees,"The uniform spanning tree (UST) and the loop-erased random walk (LERW) are strongly related probabilistic processes. We consider the limits of these models on a fine grid in the plane, as the mesh goes to zero. Although the existence of scaling limits is still unproven, subsequential scaling limits can be defined in various ways, and do exist. We establish some basic a.s. properties of these subsequential scaling limits in the plane. It is proved that any LERW subsequential scaling limit is a simple path, and that the trunk of any UST subsequential scaling limit is a topological tree, which is dense in the plane.The scaling limits of these processes are conjectured to be conformally invariant in dimension 2. We make a precise statement of the conformal invariance conjecture for the LERW, and show that this conjecture implies an explicit construction of the scaling limit, as follows. Consider the Löwner differential equation

Assuming the conformal invariance of the LERW scaling limit in the plane, we prove that the scaling limit of LERW from 0 to ∂\( \mathbb{U} \) has the same law as that of the pathf(ζ(t),t) (wheref(z,t) is extended continuously to ∂\( \mathbb{U} \)) ×(−∞,0]).

0,Law of Large Numbers for infinite random matrices over a finite field,"Asymptotic representation theory of general linear groups \(\hbox {GL}(n,F_\mathfrak {q})\) over a finite field leads to studying probability measures \(\rho \) on the group \(\mathbb {U}\) of all infinite uni-uppertriangular matrices over \(F_\mathfrak {q}\), with the condition that \(\rho \) is invariant under conjugations by arbitrary infinite matrices. Such probability measures form an infinite-dimensional simplex, and the description of its extreme points (in other words, ergodic measures \(\rho \)) was conjectured by Kerov in connection with nonnegative specializations of Hall–Littlewood symmetric functions. Vershik and Kerov also conjectured the following Law of Large Numbers. Consider an infinite random matrix drawn from an ergodic measure coming from the Kerov’s conjectural classification and its \(n \times n\) submatrix formed by the first rows and columns. The sizes of Jordan blocks of the submatrix can be interpreted as a (random) partition of \(n\), or, equivalently, as a (random) Young diagram \(\lambda (n)\) with \(n\) boxes. Then, as \(n\rightarrow \infty \), the rows and columns of \(\lambda (n)\) have almost sure limiting frequencies corresponding to parameters of this ergodic measure.

We achieve it by analyzing a new randomized Robinson–Schensted–Knuth (RSK) insertion algorithm which samples random Young diagrams \(\lambda (n)\) coming from ergodic measures. The probability weights of these Young diagrams are expressed in terms of Hall–Littlewood symmetric functions. Our insertion algorithm is a modified and extended version of a recent construction by Borodin and Petrov (2013). On the other hand, our randomized RSK insertion generalizes a version of the RSK insertion introduced by Vershik and Kerov (SIAM J. Algebr. Discret.

We give a counterexample to their result, thereby showing that the k-median LP is not tight in low dimension. Instead, we give a near optimal result showing that the k-median LP in the SBM is tight in high dimension. We also show that, if the probability measure satisfies some concentration assumptions, then the k-median LP in the SBM is tight in every dimension. Furthermore, we propose a new model of data called extended stochastic ball model (ESBM), which significantly generalizes the well-known SBM. We then show that exact recovery can still be achieved in the ESBM.

Further development of the direction associated with modeling the description of the decision-making situation is proposed. It explicitly sets the probabilities of decision-making based on the “state–probability of choice” model, provided that these probabilities can change over time. The proposed structuring of the model based on decomposition implies the formation of clusters of states, which can be provided with meaningful interpretation. The authors consider a two-level system of states, in which the base states correspond to specific probabilities of decision-making, and the states of the second level correspond to groups of states. It is shown that decomposition significantly weakens the factor related to the arbitrariness of the choice of base states. An example is given in which several groups of states are clearly distinguished, among which special attention is paid to the behavior of staunch supporters of certain alternatives, as well as to agents who hesitate.",E.

Especially forming machines heavily rely on mathematical models for control and condition monitoring. Inaccuracies during the modeling, manufacturing and assembly of these machines induce model uncertainty which impairs the controller’s performance. In this paper we propose an approach to identify model uncertainty using parameter identification, optimal design of experiments and hypothesis testing. The experimental setup is characterized by optimal sensor positions such that specific model parameters can be determined with minimal variance. This allows for the computation of confidence regions in which the real parameters or the parameter estimates from different test sets have to lie. We claim that inconsistencies in the estimated parameter values, considering their approximated confidence ellipsoids as well, cannot be explained by data uncertainty but are indicators of model uncertainty. The proposed method is demonstrated using a component of the 3D Servo Press, a multi-technology forming machine that combines spindles with eccentric servo drives.","Tristan Gally1, Peter Groche2, Florian Hoppe2, Anja Kuttich1, Alexander Matei1, Marc E.

Our results give a Gaussian analogue of the classical integrality gap result of Dyer and Frieze (Math OR, 1989) in the case of random packing IPs. In constrast to the packing case, our integrality gap depends only polynomially on m instead of exponentially. Building upon recent breakthrough work of Dey, Dubey and Molinaro (SODA, 2021), we show that the integrality gap implies that branch-and-bound requires \(n^{{\text {poly}}(m)}\) time on random Gaussian IPs with good probability, which is polynomial when the number of constraints m is fixed. We derive this result via a novel meta-theorem, which relates the size of branch-and-bound trees and the integrality gap for random logconcave IPs.","Sander Borst

0,Eventual convexity of probability constraints with elliptical distributions,"Probability constraints are often employed to intuitively define safety of given decisions in optimization problems. They simply express that a given system of inequalities depending on a decision vector and a random vector is satisfied with high enough probability. It is known that, even if this system is convex in the decision vector, the associated probability constraint is not convex in general. In this paper, we show that some degree of convexity is still preserved, for the large class of elliptical random vectors, encompassing for example Gaussian or Student random vectors. More precisely, our main result establishes that, under mild assumptions, eventual convexity holds, i.e. the probability constraint is convex when the safety level is large enough. We also provide tools to compute a concrete convexity certificate from nominal problem data.

0,Exact Probability Distributions of Selected Species in Stochastic Chemical Reaction Networks,"Chemical reactions are discrete, stochastic events. As such, the species’ molecular numbers can be described by an associated master equation. However, handling such an equation may become difficult due to the large size of reaction networks. A commonly used approach to forecast the behaviour of reaction networks is to perform computational simulations of such systems and analyse their outcome statistically. This approach, however, might require high computational costs to provide accurate results. In this paper we opt for an analytical approach to obtain the time-dependent solution of the Chemical Master Equation for selected species in a general reaction network. When the reaction networks are composed exclusively of zeroth and first-order reactions, this analytical approach significantly alleviates the computational burden required by simulation-based methods. By building upon these analytical solutions, we analyse a general monomolecular reaction network with an arbitrary number of species to obtain the exact marginal probability distribution for selected species. Additionally, we study two particular topologies of monomolecular reaction networks, namely (i) an unbranched chain of monomolecular reactions with and without synthesis and degradation reactions and (ii) a circular chain of monomolecular reactions. We illustrate our methodology and alternative ways to use it for non-linear systems by analysing a protein autoactivation mechanism. Later, we compare the computational load required for the implementation of our results and a pure computational approach to analyse an unbranched chain of monomolecular reactions.

0,Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods Applied to Tau-Leaping in Stochastic Biological Systems,"Quasi-Monte Carlo methods have proven to be effective extensions of traditional Monte Carlo methods in, amongst others, problems of quadrature and the sample path simulation of stochastic differential equations. By replacing the random number input stream in a simulation procedure by a low-discrepancy number input stream, variance reductions of several orders have been observed in financial applications. Analysis of stochastic effects in well-mixed chemical reaction networks often relies on sample path simulation using Monte Carlo methods, even though these methods suffer from typical slow \({\mathcal {O}}(N^{-1/2})\) convergence rates as a function of the number of sample paths N. This paper investigates the combination of (randomised) quasi-Monte Carlo methods with an efficient sample path simulation procedure, namely \(\tau \)-leaping. We show that this combination is often more effective than traditional Monte Carlo simulation in terms of the decay of statistical errors. The observed convergence rate behaviour is, however, non-trivial due to the discrete nature of the models of chemical reactions. We explain how this affects the performance of quasi-Monte Carlo methods by looking at a test problem in standard quadrature.","Casper H. L. Beentjes

An analog of Schoenberg's theorem is proved, a GNS-representation is obtained for conditionally positive-definite functions in terms of suitable cocycles, and this representation leads to a noncommutative generalization of the Lévy— Khinchin formula. Applications to the problem of continuous measurement in quantum mechanics are considered.

0,Channels with arbitrarily varying channel probability functions in the presence of noiseless feedback,"In this article we study a channel with arbitrarily varying channel probability functions in the presence of a noiseless feedback channel (a.v.ch.f.). We determine its capacity by proving a coding theorem and its strong converse. Our proof of the coding theorem is constructive; we give explicitly a coding scheme which performs at any rate below the capacity with an arbitrarily small decoding error probability. The proof makes use of a new method ([1]) to prove the coding theorem for discrete memoryless channels with noiseless feedback (d.m.c.f.). It was emphasized in [1] that the method is not based on random coding or maximal coding ideas, and it is this fact that makes it particularly suited for proving coding theorems for certain systems of channels with noiseless feedback.As a consequence of our results we obtain a formula for the zero-error capacity of a d.m.c.f., which was conjectured by Shannon ([8], p. 19).",Rudolf Ahlswede,Zeitschrift für Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Verwandte Gebiete,1973,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00535895,"Stochastic Process,Probability Theory,Probability Function,Mathematical Biology,Error Probability"

0,A quantitative Arrow theorem,"Arrow’s Impossibility theorem states that any constitution which satisfies independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) and unanimity and is not a dictator has to be non-transitive. In this paper we study quantitative versions of Arrow theorem. Consider n voters who vote independently at random, each following the uniform distribution over the six rankings of three alternatives. Arrow’s theorem implies that any constitution which satisfies IIA and unanimity and is not a dictator has a probability of at least 6−n for a non-transitive outcome. When n is large, 6−n is a very small probability, and the question arises if for large number of voters it is possible to avoid paradoxes with probability close to 1. Here we give a negative answer to this question by proving that for every \({\epsilon > 0}\) , there exists a \({\delta = \delta(\epsilon) > 0}\) , which depends on \({\epsilon}\) only, such that for all n, and all constitutions on three alternatives, if the constitution satisfies:

The IIA condition.


For every pair of alternatives a, b, the probability that the constitution ranks a above b is at least \({\epsilon}\).


For every voter i, the probability that the social choice function agrees with a dictatorship on i at most \({1-\epsilon}\).


Then the probability of a non-transitive outcome is at least δ. Our results generalize to any number k ≥ 3 of alternatives and to other distributions over the alternatives. We further derive a quantitative characterization of all social choice functions satisfying the IIA condition whose outcome is transitive with probability at least 1 − δ. Our results provide a quantitative statement of Arrow theorem and its generalizations and strengthen results of Kalai and Keller who proved quantitative Arrow theorems for k = 3 and for balanced constitutions only, i.e., for constitutions which satisfy for every pair of alternatives a, b, that the probability that the constitution ranks a above b is exactly 1/2. The main novel technical ingredient of our proof is the use of inverse-hypercontractivity to show that if the outcome is transitive with high probability then there are no two different voters who are pivotal with for two different pairwise preferences with non-negligible probability. Another important ingredient of the proof is the application of non-linear invariance to lower bound the probability of a paradox for constitutions where all voters have small probability for being pivotal.","Elchanan Mossel1,",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-011-0362-7,60C05

In Cheng, Devillers (eds), 30th Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry, SOCG’14, Kyoto, Japan, June 08–11, p 328, ACM, 2014). We show that any linear transformation that preserves pairwise distances up to a \((1\pm {\varepsilon })\) multiplicative factor, must preserve the persistent homology of the Čech filtration up to a factor of \((1-{\varepsilon })^{-1}\). Our results also show that the Vietoris-Rips and Delaunay filtrations for the k-distance, as well as the Čech filtration for the approximate k-distance of Buchet et al. [J Comput Geom, 58:70–96, 2016] are preserved up to a \((1\pm {\varepsilon })\) factor.

st
 and other genetic statistics for a class of population structure models","We examine genetic statistics used in the study of structured populations. In a 1999 paper, Wakeley observed that the coalescent process associated with the finite island model can be decomposed into a scattering phase and a collecting phase. This decomposition becomes exact in the large population limit with the coalescent at the end of the scattering phase converging to the Ewens sampling formula and the coalescent during the collecting phase converging to the Kingman coalescent. In this paper we introduce a class of limiting models, which we refer to as G/KC models, that generalize Wakeley’s decomposition. G in G/KC represents a completely general limit for the scattering phase, while KC represents a Kingman coalescent limit for the collecting phase. We show that both the island and two-dimensional stepping stone models converge to G/KC models in the large population limit. We then derive the distribution of the statistic F

0,Quenched localisation in the Bouchaud trap model with slowly varying traps,"We consider the quenched localisation of the Bouchaud trap model on the positive integers in the case that the trap distribution has a slowly varying tail at infinity. Our main result is that for each \(N \in \{2, 3, \ldots \}\) there exists a slowly varying tail such that quenched localisation occurs on exactly N sites. As far as we are aware, this is the first example of a model in which the exact number of localisation sites are able to be ‘tuned’ according to the model parameters. Key intuition for this result is provided by an observation about the sum-max ratio for sequences of independent and identically distributed random variables with a slowly varying distributional tail, which is of independent interest.",David A.

0,Hypergraph containers,"We develop a notion of containment for independent sets in hypergraphs. For every \(r\)-uniform hypergraph \(G\), we find a relatively small collection \({\mathcal C}\) of vertex subsets, such that every independent set of \(G\) is contained within a member of \({\mathcal C}\), and no member of \({\mathcal C}\) is large; the collection, which is in various respects optimal, reveals an underlying structure to the independent sets. The containers offer a straightforward and unified approach to many combinatorial questions concerned (usually implicitly) with independence. With regard to colouring, it follows that simple \(r\)-uniform hypergraphs of average degree \(d\) have list chromatic number at least \((1/(r-1)^2+o(1))\log _r d\). For \(r=2\) this improves a bound due to Alon and is tight. For \(r\ge 3\), previous bounds were weak but the present inequality is close to optimal. In the context of extremal graph theory, it follows that, for each \(\ell \)-uniform hypergraph \(H\) of order \(k\), there is a collection \({\mathcal C}\) of \(\ell \)-uniform hypergraphs of order \(n\) each with \(o(n^k)\) copies of \(H\), such that every \(H\)-free \(\ell \)-uniform hypergraph of order \(n\) is a subgraph of a hypergraph in \({\mathcal C}\), and \(\log |{\mathcal C}|\le c n^{\ell -1/m(H)}\log n\) where \(m(H)\) is a standard parameter (there is a similar statement for induced subgraphs). This yields simple proofs, for example, for the number of \(H\)-free hypergraphs, and for the sparsity theorems of Conlon–Gowers and Schacht. A slight variant yields a counting version of the KŁR conjecture. Likewise, for systems of linear equations the containers supply, for example, bounds on the number of solution-free sets, and the existence of solutions in sparse random subsets.

Disadvantages of grid algorithms that require calculation of values of the kernel of integral equations at fixed points are revealed (practically, the kernels of equation have integrable singularities and this calculation is impossible).

0,Anomalous diffusion of random walk on random planar maps,"We prove that the simple random walk on the uniform infinite planar triangulation (UIPT) typically travels graph distance at most \(n^{1/4 + o_n(1)}\) in n units of time. Together with the complementary lower bound proven by Gwynne and Miller (2017) this shows that the typical graph distance displacement of the walk after n steps is \(n^{1/4 + o_n(1)}\), as conjectured by Benjamini and Curien (Geom Funct Anal 2(2):501–531, 2013. arXiv:1202.5454). More generally, we show that the simple random walks on a certain family of random planar maps in the \(\gamma \)-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) universality class for \(\gamma \in (0,2)\)—including spanning tree-weighted maps, bipolar-oriented maps, and mated-CRT maps—typically travels graph distance \(n^{1/d_\gamma + o_n(1)}\) in n units of time, where \(d_\gamma \) is the growth exponent for the volume of a metric ball on the map, which was shown to exist and depend only on \(\gamma \) by Ding and Gwynne (Commun Math Phys 374:1877–1934, 2018. arXiv:1807.01072). Since \(d_\gamma > 2\), this shows that the simple random walk on each of these maps is subdiffusive. Our proofs are based on an embedding of the random planar maps under consideration into \({\mathbb {C}}\) wherein graph distance balls can be compared to Euclidean balls modulo subpolynomial errors. This embedding arises from a coupling of the given random planar map with a mated-CRT map together with the relationship of the latter map to SLE-decorated LQG.

We use a simple approach for arrival rate estimation and solve the routing probability assignment by formulating it as a convex quadratic program and using the affine scaling algorithm to obtain an optimal solution.We further address a practical variant of the problem that involves changing routing probabilities associated with k nodes in the graph, where k is a prespecified number, to minimize the objective function. This involves deciding which k nodes to select for changing probabilities and determining the optimal value of the probabilities. We solve this problem using a heuristic that ranks all subsets of k nodes using gradient information around a given probability assignment.The routing model and the heuristic are evaluated for speed of computation of optimal probabilities and load balancing performance using a Monte Carlo simulation.

In contrast with usual (one-period) formulations of the problem, such multi-period formulation better matches the nature of bankruptcy process (bankruptcy occurs in time) and allows an easier and more natural incorporation of bankruptcy (default) prognoses in valuation of risky debt and equity, optimization of corporate capital structure etc. The study uses a new mathematical apparatus—multi-alternative decision rules of statistical decision theory. We investigate a new type of predictive variables that can be extracted from the maturity schedule of a firm’s long-term debt. The study develops Bayesian-type forecasting rules that use both maturity schedule factors and traditional financial ratios.

0,Decision making under uncertainty with fuzzy targets,"This paper discusses the issue of how to use fuzzy targets in the target-based model for decision making under uncertainty. After introducing a target-based interpretation of the expected value on which it is shown that this model implicitly assumes a neutral behavior on attitude about the target, we examine the issue of using fuzzy targets considering different attitudes about the target selection of the decision maker. We also discuss the problem for situations on which the decision maker’s attitude about target may change according to different states of nature. Especially, it is shown that the target-based approach can provide an unified way for solving the problem of fuzzy decision making with uncertainty about the state of nature and imprecision about payoffs. Several numerical examples are given for illustration of the discussed issues.","Van-Nam Huynh1, Yoshiteru Nakamori1, Mina Ryoke2 & …Tu-Bao Ho",Fuzzy Optimization and Decision Making,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10700-007-9011-0,"Decision making,Uncertainty,Fuzzy target,Expected utility,Risk attitude"
0,Quantitative stability analysis for minimax distributionally robust risk optimization,"This paper considers distributionally robust formulations of a two stage stochastic programming problem with the objective of minimizing a distortion risk of the minimal cost incurred at the second stage. We carry out a stability analysis by looking into variations of the ambiguity set under the Wasserstein metric, decision spaces at both stages and the support set of the random variables. In the case when the risk measure is risk neutral, the stability result is presented with the variation of the ambiguity set being measured by generic metrics of \(\zeta \)-structure, which provides a unified framework for quantitative stability analysis under various metrics including total variation metric and Kantorovich metric. When the ambiguity set is structured by a \(\zeta \)-ball, we find that the Hausdorff distance between two \(\zeta \)-balls is bounded by the distance of their centers and difference of their radii. The findings allow us to strengthen some recent convergence results on distributionally robust optimization where the center of the Wasserstein ball is constructed by the empirical probability distribution.","Alois Pichler

The uncertainty in the system satisfies a stochastic integral quadratic constraint. To convert the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one, a special S-procedure is applied. The resulting unconstrained game-type optimization problem is then converted into a risk-sensitive stochastic control problem with an exponential-of-integral cost functional. This is achieved via a certain duality relation between stochastic dynamic games and risk-sensitive stochastic control.

They allow formal reasoning about how the various components of a system contribute to its overall behaviour. In this paper we show how process algebras can be usefully applied to understanding social insect biology, in particular to studying the relationship between algorithmic behaviour of individual insects and the dynamical behaviour of their colony. We argue that process algebras provide a useful formalism for understanding this relationship, since they combine computer simulation, Markov chain analysis and mean-field methods of analysis. Indeed, process algebras can provide a framework for relating these three methods of analysis to each other and to experiments.

This conversation with Bernard Bru illustrates the scientific climate of his times and the conditions under which Bachelier made his discoveries. It indicates that Bachelier was indeed the right person at the right time. He was involved with the Paris stock exchange, was self-taught but also took courses in probability and on the theory of heat. Not being a part of the “scientific establishment,” he had the opportunity to develop an area that was not of interest to the mathematicians of the period. He was the first to apply the trajectories of Brownian motion, and his theories prefigure modern mathematical finance. What follows is an edited and expanded version of the original conversation with Bernard Bru.Bernard Bru is the author, most recently, of Borel, Lévy, Neyman, Pearson et les autres.

0,Two approaches to optimal routing and admission control in systems with real-time traffic,"This paper addresses the problem of routing and admission control of real-time traffic in a queueing system where customers must begin service within given deadlines (or complete service within given deadlines), otherwise they are considered lost. Performance in such systems is measured by the probability a customer is lost. For a system ofK parallel servers with a probabilistic routing and admission control scheme, the problem of the optimal routing and admission control is considered and two approaches are presented. Assuming the availability of a closed-form expression for the probability of loss at each server, the problem is solved under general conditions and properties of the optimal flow allocation are given. However, such closed-form expressions are often unavailable. This motivates a second approach, which involves a gradient-based stochastic optimization algorithm with on-line gradient estimation. The gradient estimation problem for loss probabilities is solved through a recently-developed smoothed perturbation analysis (SPA) technique. The effectiveness of on-line stochastic optimization using this type of gradient estimator is demonstrated by combining the SPA algorithm with a sampling-controlled stochastic optimization algorithm for the aforementioned routing and admission control problem.",M.

0,"Convex hulls of random walks, hyperplane arrangements, and Weyl chambers","We give an explicit formula for the probability that the convex hull of an n-step random walk in \({\mathbb{R}^d}\) does not contain the origin, under the assumption that the distribution of increments of the walk is centrally symmetric and puts no mass on affine hyperplanes. This extends the formula by Sparre Andersen (Skand Aktuarietidskr 32:27–36, 1949) for the probability that such random walk in dimension one stays positive. Our result is distribution-free, that is, the probability does not depend on the distribution of increments.

This probabilistic problem is shown to be equivalent to either of the two geometric ones: (1) Find the number of Weyl chambers of type B

n
 intersected by a generic linear subspace of \({\mathbb{R}^n}\) of codimension d; (2) Find the conic intrinsic volumes of a Weyl chamber of type B

n

We obtain analogous distribution-free results for Weyl chambers of type \({A_{n-1}}\) (yielding the probability of absorption of the origin by the convex hull of a generic random walk bridge), type D

n
, and direct products of Weyl chambers (yielding the absorption probability for the joint convex hull of several random walks or bridges). The simplest case of products of the form \({B_1\times \cdots \times B_1}\) recovers the Wendel formula (Math Scand 11:109–111, 1962) for the probability that the convex hull of an i.i.d. multidimensional sample chosen from a centrally symmetric distribution does not contain the origin.

0,Algorithmic Calculation of the Optimality Probability of Decision Rules,"We study the dichotomous choice model under conditions of uncertainty. In this model, a committee of decision makers is required to select one of two alternatives, of which exactly one is correct. A decision rule translates the individual opinions into a group decision. We focus on the direction concerned with the identification of the optimal decision rule under partial information on the decision skills. Namely, we assume the correctness probabilities of the committee members to be independent random variables, selected from some given distribution. In addition, we assume that the ranking of the members in the committee is known. Thus, one can follow rules based on this ranking.One of the commonly used measures of the efficiency of a decision rule is its probability of being optimal. Here we provide a method for an explicit calculation of this probability for any given weighted majority rule for a wide family of distribution functions. Moreover, under the assumption of exponentially distributed decision skills, we provide an improved algorithm for this calculation.

0,A Hypocoercivity Related Ergodicity Method for Singularly Distorted Non-Symmetric Diffusions,"In this article we develop a new abstract strategy for proving ergodicity with explicit computable rate of convergence for diffusions associated with a degenerate Kolmogorov operator L. A crucial point is that the evolution operator L may have singular and nonsmooth coefficients. This allows the application of the method e.g. to degenerate and singular particle systems arising in Mathematical Physics. As far as we know in such singular cases the relaxation to equilibrium can’t be discussed with the help of existing approaches using hypoellipticity, hypocoercivity or stochastic Lyapunov type techniques. The method is formulated in an L
2-Hilbert space setting and is based on an interplay between Functional Analysis and Stochastics. Moreover, it implies an ergodicity rate which can be related to L
2-exponential convergence of the semigroup. Furthermore, the ergodicity method shows up an interesting analogy with existing hypocoercivity approaches. In the first application we discuss ergodicity of the N-particle degenerate Langevin dynamics with singular potentials. The dual to this equation is also called the kinetic Fokker–Planck equation with an external confining potential. In the second example we apply the method to the so-called (degenerate) spherical velocity Langevin equation which is also known as the fiber lay-down process arising in industrial mathematics.","Martin Grothaus

0,Data-driven inference for stationary jump-diffusion processes with application to membrane voltage fluctuations in pyramidal neurons,"The emergent activity of biological systems can often be represented as low-dimensional, Langevin-type stochastic differential equations. In certain systems, however, large and abrupt events occur and violate the assumptions of this approach. We address this situation here by providing a novel method that reconstructs a jump-diffusion stochastic process based solely on the statistics of the original data. Our method assumes that these data are stationary, that diffusive noise is additive, and that jumps are Poisson. We use threshold-crossing of the increments to detect jumps in the time series. This is followed by an iterative scheme that compensates for the presence of diffusive fluctuations that are falsely detected as jumps. Our approach is based on probabilistic calculations associated with these fluctuations and on the use of the Fokker–Planck and the differential Chapman–Kolmogorov equations. After some validation cases, we apply this method to recordings of membrane noise in pyramidal neurons of the electrosensory lateral line lobe of weakly electric fish. These recordings display large, jump-like depolarization events that occur at random times, the biophysics of which is unknown. We find that some pyramidal cells increase their jump rate and noise intensity as the membrane potential approaches spike threshold, while their drift function and jump amplitude distribution remain unchanged. As our method is fully data-driven, it provides a valuable means to further investigate the functional role of these jump-like events without relying on unconstrained biophysical models.","Alexandre Melanson

Usual deterministic lumped parameter models were used for the dynamics of the chemostat for large numbers of the two populations; the generalized birth and death stochastic process was employed for the description of the random variations at small prey numbers. Extinction probabilities of the prey population were calculated for different holding times and chemostat volumes, and their dependence upon the growth parameters of the two populations was studied. It was found that extinction was possible when the Monod model was used for the specific growth rate of the predators as a function of the prey number density. On the other hand, the decrease of the feeding activity of the predators at low prey densities predicted by the multiple saturation model acts as a regulatory factor that prevents extinction of the prey. In view of the fact that extinction of the prey has never been observed in the laboratory, the latter model seems more appropriate to describe the dynamics of microbial predation.",Gregory Stephanopoulos1 & A.

In this paper, we show how adaptive techniques can be used to create algorithms that adjust their behavior to suit the problem instance being solved. We present three design principles towards this goal: cost-based neighborhood heuristics, growing neighborhood sizes, and the application of learning algorithms to combine portfolios of neighborhood heuristics. Our results show that the application of these principles gives strong performance on a challenging set of job shop scheduling problems. More importantly, we are able to achieve robust solving performance across problem sets and time limits.",Tom Carchrae1 & J.

0,The critical domain size of stochastic population models,"Identifying the critical domain size necessary for a population to persist is an important question in ecology. Both demographic and environmental stochasticity impact a population’s ability to persist. Here we explore ways of including this variability. We study populations with distinct dispersal and sedentary stages, which have traditionally been modelled using a deterministic integrodifference equation (IDE) framework. Individual-based models (IBMs) are the most intuitive stochastic analogues to IDEs but yield few analytic insights. We explore two alternate approaches; one is a scaling up to the population level using the Central Limit Theorem, and the other a variation on both Galton–Watson branching processes and branching processes in random environments. These branching process models closely approximate the IBM and yield insight into the factors determining the critical domain size for a given population subject to stochasticity.","Jody R.

0,Probabilistic constrained optimization on flow networks,"Uncertainty often plays an important role in dynamic flow problems. In this paper, we consider both, a stationary and a dynamic flow model with uncertain boundary data on networks. We introduce two different ways how to compute the probability for random boundary data to be feasible, discussing their advantages and disadvantages. In this context, feasible means, that the flow corresponding to the random boundary data meets some box constraints at the network junctions. The first method is the spheric radial decomposition and the second method is a kernel density estimation. In both settings, we consider certain optimization problems and we compute derivatives of the probabilistic constraint using the kernel density estimator. Moreover, we derive necessary optimality conditions for an approximated problem for the stationary and the dynamic case. Throughout the paper, we use numerical examples to illustrate our results by comparing them with a classical Monte Carlo approach to compute the desired probability.","Michael Schuster

0,Measures of success in a class of evolutionary models with fixed population size and structure," We investigate a class of evolutionary models, encompassing many established models of well-mixed and spatially structured populations. Models in this class have fixed population size and structure. Evolution proceeds as a Markov chain, with birth and death probabilities dependent on the current population state. Starting from basic assumptions, we show how the asymptotic (long-term) behavior of the evolutionary process can be characterized by probability distributions over the set of possible states. We then define and compare three quantities characterizing evolutionary success: fixation probability, expected frequency, and expected change due to selection. We show that these quantities yield the same conditions for success in the limit of low mutation rate, but may disagree when mutation is present. As part of our analysis, we derive versions of the Price equation and the replicator equation that describe the asymptotic behavior of the entire evolutionary process, rather than the change from a single state. We illustrate our results using the frequency-dependent Moran process and the birth–death process on graphs as examples. Our broader aim is to spearhead a new approach to evolutionary theory, in which general principles of evolution are proven as mathematical theorems from axioms.","Benjamin Allen1,2 & Corina E.

0,Imaginary geometry I: interacting SLEs,"Fix constants \(\chi >0\) and \(\theta \in [0,2\pi )\), and let h be an instance of the Gaussian free field on a planar domain. We study flow lines of the vector field \(e^{i(h/\chi +\theta )}\) starting at a fixed boundary point of the domain. Letting \(\theta \) vary, one obtains a family of curves that look locally like \(\hbox {SLE}_\kappa \) processes with \(\kappa \in (0,4)\) (where \(\chi = \tfrac{2}{\sqrt{\kappa }} -\tfrac{ \sqrt{\kappa }}{2}\)), which we interpret as the rays of a random geometry with purely imaginary curvature. We extend the fundamental existence and uniqueness results about these paths to the case that the paths intersect the boundary. We also show that flow lines of different angles cross each other at most once but (in contrast to what happens when h is smooth) may bounce off of each other after crossing. Flow lines of the same angle started at different points merge into each other upon intersecting, forming a tree structure. We construct so-called counterflow lines (\(\hbox {SLE}_{16/\kappa }\)) within the same geometry using ordered “light cones” of points accessible by angle-restricted trajectories and develop a robust theory of flow and counterflow line interaction. The theory leads to new results about \(\hbox {SLE}\). For example, we prove that \(\hbox {SLE}_\kappa (\rho )\) processes are almost surely continuous random curves, even when they intersect the boundary, and establish Duplantier duality for general \(\hbox {SLE}_{16/\kappa }(\rho )\) processes.","Jason Miller1,2 nAff3 & Scott Sheffield",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-016-0698-0,60J67

We introduce the notion of an invariant Markov operator on a groupoid and show that the Liouville property (absence of non-trivial bounded harmonic functions) for such an operator implies amenability of the groupoid. Moreover, the groupoid action on the Poisson boundary of any invariant operator is always amenable. This approach subsumes as particular cases numerous earlier results on amenability for groups, actions, equivalence relations and foliations.

0,Evolutionary Games on Star Graphs Under Various Updating Rules,"Evolutionary game dynamics have been traditionally studied in well-mixed populations where each individual is equally likely to interact with every other individual. Recent studies have shown that the outcome of the evolutionary process might be significantly affected if the population has a non-homogeneous structure. In this paper we study analytically an evolutionary game between two strategies interacting on an extreme heterogeneous graph, the star graph. We find explicit expressions for the fixation probability of mutants, and the time to absorption (elimination or fixation of mutants) and fixation (absorption conditional on fixation occurring). We investigate the evolutionary process considering four important update rules. For each of the update rules, we find appropriate conditions under which one strategy is favoured over the other. The process is considered in four different scenarios: the fixed fitness case, the Hawk–Dove game, the Prisoner’s dilemma and a coordination game. It is shown that in contrast with homogeneous populations, the choice of the update rule might be crucial for the evolution of a non-homogeneous population.","C. Hadjichrysanthou1, M. Broom1 & J.

In this paper, a range of market models that allow a positive relationship between default correlation and default probability, including the correlation mapping methods and the implied copula models, are compared with the Gaussian copula model, based on their relative performance in hedging credit spread risk and pricing bespoke CDOs. The models assessed are calibrated to the traded CDO tranche spreads prior to the credit crisis and then compared based on the mean absolute pricing errors over a time period including the credit crisis.

0,Nonconvex and Nonsmooth Approaches for Affine Chance-Constrained Stochastic Programs,"Chance-constrained programs (CCPs) constitute a difficult class of stochastic programs due to its possible nondifferentiability and nonconvexity even with simple linear random functionals. Existing approaches for solving the CCPs mainly deal with convex random functionals within the probability function. In the present paper, we consider two generalizations of the class of chance constraints commonly studied in the literature; one generalization involves probabilities of disjunctive nonconvex functional events and the other generalization involves mixed-signed affine combinations of the resulting probabilities; together, we coin the term affine chance constraint (ACC) system for these generalized chance constraints. Our proposed treatment of such an ACC system involves the fusion of several individually known ideas: (a) parameterized upper and lower approximations of the indicator function in the expectation formulation of probability; (b) external (i.e., fixed) versus internal (i.e., sequential) sampling-based approximation of the expectation operator; (c) constraint penalization as relaxations of feasibility; and (d) convexification of nonconvexity and nondifferentiability via surrogation. The integration of these techniques for solving the affine chance-constrained stochastic program (ACC-SP) is the main contribution of this paper. Indeed, combined together, these ideas lead to several algorithmic strategies with various degrees of practicality and computational efforts for the nonconvex ACC-SP. In an external sampling scheme, a given sample batch (presumably large) is applied to a penalty formulation of a fixed-accuracy approximation of the chance constraints of the problem via their expectation formulation. This results in a sample average approximation scheme, whose almost-sure convergence under a directional derivative condition to a Clarke stationary solution of the expectation constrained-SP as the sample sizes tend to infinity is established. In contrast, sequential sampling, along with surrogation leads to a sequential convex programming based algorithm whose asymptotic convergence for fixed- and diminishing-accuracy approximations of the indicator function can be established under prescribed increments of the sample sizes.","Ying Cui1, Junyi Liu2 & Jong-Shi Pang",Set-Valued and Variational Analysis,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11228-022-00639-y,"Chance constraints,Nonconvex,Nonsmooth,Continuous approximations,Sampling,Exact penalization"

0,Problem-driven scenario generation: an analytical approach for stochastic programs with tail risk measure,"Scenario generation is the construction of a discrete random vector to represent parameters of uncertain values in a stochastic program. Most approaches to scenario generation are distribution-driven, that is, they attempt to construct a random vector which captures well in a probabilistic sense the uncertainty. On the other hand, a problem-driven approach may be able to exploit the structure of a problem to provide a more concise representation of the uncertainty. In this paper we propose an analytic approach to problem-driven scenario generation. This approach applies to stochastic programs where a tail risk measure, such as conditional value-at-risk, is applied to a loss function. Since tail risk measures only depend on the upper tail of a distribution, standard methods of scenario generation, which typically spread their scenarios evenly across the support of the random vector, struggle to adequately represent tail risk. Our scenario generation approach works by targeting the construction of scenarios in areas of the distribution corresponding to the tails of the loss distributions. We provide conditions under which our approach is consistent with sampling, and as proof-of-concept demonstrate how our approach could be applied to two classes of problem, namely network design and portfolio selection. Numerical tests on the portfolio selection problem demonstrate that our approach yields better and more stable solutions compared to standard Monte Carlo sampling.

The coefficient of the PFA probability is an upper bound on the extent to which conglomerability may fail in a finitely additive probability with that decomposition. If the probability is defined on a σ-field, the bound is sharp. Hence, non-conglomerability (or equivalently non-disintegrability) characterizes finitely as opposed to countably additive probability. Nonetheless, there exists a PFA probability which is simultaneously conglomerable over an arbitrary finite set of partitions.Neither conglomerability nor non-conglomerability in a given partition is closed under convex combinations. But the convex combination of PFA ultrafilter probabilities, each of which cannot be made conglomerable in a common margin, is singular with respect to any finitely additive probability that is conglomerable in that margin.","Mark J.

0,"Diffusion approximations for one-locus multi-allele kin selection, mutation and random drift in group-structured populations: a unifying approach to selection models in population genetics","Diffusion approximations are ascertained from a two-time-scale argument in the case of a group-structured diploid population with scaled viability parameters depending on the individual genotype and the group type at a single multi-allelic locus under recurrent mutation, and applied to the case of random pairwise interactions within groups. The main step consists in proving global and uniform convergence of the distribution of the group types in an infinite population in the absence of selection and mutation, using a coalescent approach. An inclusive fitness formulation with coefficient of relatedness between a focal individual J affecting the reproductive success of an individual I, defined as the expected fraction of genes in I that are identical by descent to one or more genes in J in a neutral infinite population, given that J is allozygous or autozygous, yields the correct selection drift functions. These are analogous to the selection drift functions obtained with pure viability selection in a population with inbreeding. They give the changes of the allele frequencies in an infinite population without mutation that correspond to the replicator equation with fitness matrix expressed as a linear combination of a symmetric matrix for allozygous individuals and a rank-one matrix for autozygous individuals. In the case of no inbreeding, the mean inclusive fitness is a strict Lyapunov function with respect to this deterministic dynamics. Connections are made between dispersal with exact replacement (proportional dispersal), uniform dispersal, and local extinction and recolonization. The timing of dispersal (before or after selection, before or after mating) is shown to have an effect on group competition and the effective population size.",Sabin Lessard,Journal of Mathematical Biology,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-008-0248-1,"Diffusion approximation,Kin selection,Island model,Covariance formulas,Relatedness coefficients,Coalescent process,Group selection,Effective population size,Replicator equation,Fundamental theorem of natural selection"
0,Stochastic models of tumor growth and the probability of elimination by cytotoxic cells,"The probability of tumor extinction due to the action of cytotoxic cell populations is investigated by several one dimensional stochastic models of the population growth and elimination processes of a tumor. The several models are made necessary by the nonlinearity of the processes and the different parameter ranges explored.The deterministic form of the model is \(\lambda _0 = \gamma _0 - k_6^\prime /K_1 \) where γ0, k′6 and k
1 are positive constants. The parameter of most import is \(Q_\beta \) which determines the stability of the T = 0 equilibrium. With an initial tumor size of one, a (linear) branching process is used to estimate the extinction probability. However, in the case λ = 0 when the linearization of the deterministic model gives no information (T = 0 is actually unstable) the branching model is unsatisfactory. This makes necessary the utilization of a density-dependent branching process to approximate the population. Through scaling a diffusion limit is reached which enables one to again compute the probability of extinction. For populations away from one a sequence of density-dependent jump Markov processes are approximated by a sequence of diffusion processes. In limiting cases, the estimates of extinction correspond to that computed from the original branching process. Table 1 summarizes the results.",Stephen J.

0,On rates of convergence for sample average approximations in the almost sure sense and in mean,"We study the rates at which optimal estimators in the sample average approximation approach converge to their deterministic counterparts in the almost sure sense and in mean. To be able to quantify these rates, we consider the law of the iterated logarithm in a Banach space setting and first establish under relatively mild assumptions almost sure convergence rates for the approximating objective functions, which can then be transferred to the estimators for optimal values and solutions of the approximated problem. By exploiting a characterisation of the law of the iterated logarithm in Banach spaces, we are further able to derive under the same assumptions that the estimators also converge in mean, at a rate which essentially coincides with the one in the almost sure sense. This, in turn, allows to quantify the asymptotic bias of optimal estimators as well as to draw conclusive insights on their mean squared error and on the estimators for the optimality gap. Finally, we address the notion of convergence in probability to derive rates in probability for the deviation of optimal estimators and (weak) rates of error probabilities without imposing strong conditions on exponential moments. We discuss the possibility to construct confidence sets for the optimal values and solutions from our obtained results and provide a numerical illustration of the most relevant findings.","Dirk Banholzer1, Jörg Fliege

0,On geodesic completeness for Riemannian metrics on smooth probability densities,"The geometric approach to optimal transport and information theory has triggered the interpretation of probability densities as an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold. The most studied Riemannian structures are the Otto metric, yielding the \(L^2\)-Wasserstein distance of optimal mass transport, and the Fisher–Rao metric, predominant in the theory of information geometry. On the space of smooth probability densities, none of these Riemannian metrics are geodesically complete—a property desirable for example in imaging applications. That is, the existence interval for solutions to the geodesic flow equations cannot be extended to the whole real line. Here we study a class of Hamilton–Jacobi-like partial differential equations arising as geodesic flow equations for higher-order Sobolev type metrics on the space of smooth probability densities. We give order conditions for global existence and uniqueness, thereby providing geodesic completeness. The system we study is an interesting example of a flow equation with loss of derivatives, which is well-posed in the smooth category, yet non-parabolic and fully non-linear. On a more general note, the paper establishes a link between geometric analysis on the space of probability densities and analysis of Euler–Arnold equations in topological hydrodynamics.","Martin Bauer1, Sarang Joshi2 & Klas Modin3,",Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00526-017-1195-8,"58B20,58E10,35G25,35Q31,76N10"

0,Finite-Time Performance Analysis of Static Simulated Annealing Algorithms,"Generalized hill climbing (GHC) algorithms provide a framework for modeling local search algorithms for addressing intractable discrete optimization problems. Current theoretical results are based on the assumption that the goal when addressing such problems is to find a globally optimal solution. However, from a practical point of view, solutions that are close enough to a globally optimal solution (where close enough is measured in terms of the objective function value) for a discrete optimization problem may be acceptable. This paper introduces β-acceptable solutions, where β is a value greater than or equal to the globally optimal objective function value. Moreover, measures for assessing the finite-time performance of GHC algorithms, in terms of identifying β-acceptable solutions, are defined. A variation of simulated annealing (SA), termed static simulated annealing (S2A), is analyzed using these measures. S2A uses a fixed cooling schedule during the algorithm's execution. Though S2A is provably nonconvergent, its finite-time performance can be assessed using the finite-time performance measures defined in terms of identifying β-acceptable solutions. Computational results with a randomly generated instance of the traveling salesman problem are reported to illustrate the results presented. These results show that upper and lower estimates for the number of iterations to reach a β-acceptable solution within a specified number of iterations can be obtained, and that these estimates are most accurate for moderate and high fixed temperature values for the S2A algorithm.",Jeffrey E.

Due to the difficulties in checking the feasibility of the probabilistic constraint and the non-convexity of the feasible region, chance constrained problems are generally solved through approximations. Joint chance constrained problem enforces that several constraints are satisfied simultaneously and it is more complicated than individual chance constrained problem. This work investigates the tractable robust optimization approximation framework for solving the joint chance constrained problem. Various robust counterpart optimization formulations are derived based on different types of uncertainty set. To improve the quality of robust optimization approximation, a two-layer algorithm is proposed.

0,Centers of probability measures without the mean,"In the recent years, the notion of mixability has been developed with applications to operations research, optimal transportation, and quantitative finance. An n-tuple of distributions is said to be jointly mixable if there exist n random variables following these distributions and adding up to a constant, called center, with probability one. When the n distributions are identical, we speak of complete mixability. If each distribution has finite mean, the center is obviously the sum of the means. In this paper, we investigate the set of centers of completely and jointly mixable distributions not having a finite mean. In addition to several results, we show the (possibly counterintuitive) fact that, for each \(n \ge 2\), there exist n standard Cauchy random variables adding up to a constant C if and only if $$\begin{aligned} |C|\le \frac{n\,\log (n-1)}{\pi }. \end{aligned}$$","Giovanni Puccetti1, Pietro Rigo2, Bin Wang3 & …Ruodu Wang",Journal of Theoretical Probability,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10959-018-0815-3,"Cauchy distribution,Complete mixability,Joint mixability,Multivariate dependence"
0,Generating M-Indeterminate Probability Densities by Way of Quantum Mechanics,"Probability densities that are not uniquely determined by their moments are said to be “moment-indeterminate,” or “M-indeterminate.” Determining whether or not a density is M-indeterminate, or how to generate an M-indeterminate density, is a challenging problem with a long history. Quantum mechanics is inherently probabilistic, yet the way in which probability densities are obtained is dramatically different in comparison with standard probability theory, involving complex wave functions and operators, among other aspects. Nevertheless, the end results are standard probabilistic quantities, such as expectation values, moments and probability density functions. We show that the quantum mechanics procedure to obtain densities leads to a simple method to generate an infinite number of M-indeterminate densities. Different self-adjoint operators can lead to new classes of M-indeterminate densities. Depending on the operator, the method can produce densities that are of the Stieltjes class or new formulations that are not of the Stieltjes class. As such, the method complements and extends existing approaches and opens up new avenues for further development. The method applies to continuous and discrete probability densities. A number of examples are given.","Rafael Sala Mayato1, Patrick Loughlin2 & Leon Cohen

Yet the converse is not true in general. In this paper, we show that, provided that certain conditions are satisfied, from the given completely integrable quantile equation, one can construct a multivariate distribution with a fully reproducible “big” conditional quantile.

0,Modeling the presence probability of invasive plant species with nonlocal dispersal,"Mathematical models for the spread of invading plant organisms typically utilize population growth and dispersal dynamics to predict the time-evolution of a population distribution. In this paper, we revisit a particular class of deterministic contact models obtained from a stochastic birth process for invasive organisms. These models were introduced by Mollison (J R Stat Soc 39(3):283, 1977). We derive the deterministic integro-differential equation of a more general contact model and show that the quantity of interest may be interpreted not as population size, but rather as the probability of species occurrence. We proceed to show how landscape heterogeneity can be included in the model by utilizing the concept of statistical habitat suitability models which condense diverse ecological data into a single statistic. As ecologists often deal with species presence data rather than population size, we argue that a model for probability of occurrence allows for a realistic determination of initial conditions from data. Finally, we present numerical results of our deterministic model and compare them to simulations of the underlying stochastic process.","Christopher Strickland1, Gerhard Dangelmayr1 & Patrick D.

0,Dynamical insurance models with investment: Constrained singular problems for integrodifferential equations,"Previous and new results are used to compare two mathematical insurance models with identical insurance company strategies in a financial market, namely, when the entire current surplus or its constant fraction is invested in risky assets (stocks), while the rest of the surplus is invested in a risk-free asset (bank account). Model I is the classical Cramér–Lundberg risk model with an exponential claim size distribution. Model II is a modification of the classical risk model (risk process with stochastic premiums) with exponential distributions of claim and premium sizes. For the survival probability of an insurance company over infinite time (as a function of its initial surplus), there arise singular problems for second-order linear integrodifferential equations (IDEs) defined on a semiinfinite interval and having nonintegrable singularities at zero: model I leads to a singular constrained initial value problem for an IDE with a Volterra integral operator, while II model leads to a more complicated nonlocal constrained problem for an IDE with a non-Volterra integral operator. A brief overview of previous results for these two problems depending on several positive parameters is given, and new results are presented. Additional results are concerned with the formulation, analysis, and numerical study of “degenerate” problems for both models, i.e., problems in which some of the IDE parameters vanish; moreover, passages to the limit with respect to the parameters through which we proceed from the original problems to the degenerate ones are singular for small and/or large argument values. Such problems are of mathematical and practical interest in themselves. Along with insurance models without investment, they describe the case of surplus completely invested in risk-free assets, as well as some noninsurance models of surplus dynamics, for example, charity-type models.","T.

0,"Nonequilibrium in Thermodynamic Formalism: The Second Law, Gases and Information Geometry","In nonequilibrium thermodynamics and information theory, the relative entropy (or, KL divergence) plays a very important role. Consider a Hölder Jacobian J and the Ruelle (transfer) operator \({\mathcal {L}}_{\log J}.\) Two equilibrium probabilities \(\mu _1\) and \(\mu _2\), can interact via a discrete-time Thermodynamic Operation given by the action of the dual of the Ruelle operator \( {\mathcal {L}}_{\log J}^*\). We argue that the law \(\mu \rightarrow {\mathcal {L}}_{\log J}^*(\mu )\), producing nonequilibrium, can be seen as a Thermodynamic Operation after showing that it’s a manifestation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We also show that the change of relative entropy satisfies $$\begin{aligned} D_{K L} (\mu _1,\mu _2) - D_{K L} ({\mathcal {L}}_{\log J}^*(\mu _1),{\mathcal {L}}_{\log J}^*(\mu _2))= 0. \end{aligned}$$Furthermore, we describe sufficient conditions on \(J,\mu _1\) for getting \(h({\mathcal {L}}_{\log J}^*(\mu _1))\ge h(\mu _1)\), where h is entropy. Recalling a natural Riemannian metric in the Banach manifold of Hölder equilibrium probabilities we exhibit the second-order Taylor formula for an infinitesimal tangent change of KL divergence; a crucial estimate in Information Geometry. We introduce concepts like heat, work, volume, pressure, and internal energy, which play here the role of the analogous ones in Thermodynamics of gases. We briefly describe the MaxEnt method.

0,Continued fractions and the origins of the Perron–Frobenius theorem,"The theory of nonnegative matrices is an example of a theory motivated in its origins and development by purely mathematical concerns that later proved to have a remarkably broad spectrum of applications to such diverse fields as probability theory, numerical analysis, economics, dynamical programming, and demography. At the heart of the theory is what is usually known as the Perron–Frobenius Theorem. It was inspired by a theorem of Oskar Perron on positive matrices, usually called Perron’s Theorem. This paper is primarily concerned with the origins of Perron’s Theorem in his masterful work on ordinary and generalized continued fractions (1907) and its role in inspiring the remarkable work of Frobenius on nonnegative matrices (1912) that produced, inter alia, the Perron–Frobenius Theorem. The paper is not at all intended exclusively for readers with expertise in the theory of nonnegative matrices. Anyone with a basic grounding in linear algebra should be able to read this article and come away with a good understanding of the Perron–Frobenius Theorem as well as its historical origins. The final section of the paper considers the first major application of the Perron–Frobenius Theorem, namely, to the theory of Markov chains. When he introduced the eponymous chains in 1908, Markov adumbrated several key notions and results of the Perron–Frobenius theory albeit within the much simpler context of stochastic matrices; but it was by means of Frobenius’ 1912 paper that the linear algebraic foundations of Markov’s theory for nonpositive stochastic matrices were first established by R.

0,Hybrid Monte Carlo methods for sampling probability measures on submanifolds,"
Probability measures supported on submanifolds can be sampled by adding an extra momentum variable to the state of the system, and discretizing the associated Hamiltonian dynamics with some stochastic perturbation in the extra variable. In order to avoid biases in the invariant probability measures sampled by discretizations of these stochastically perturbed Hamiltonian dynamics, a Metropolis rejection procedure can be considered. The so-obtained scheme belongs to the class of generalized Hybrid Monte Carlo (GHMC) algorithms. We show here how to generalize to GHMC a procedure suggested by Goodman, Holmes-Cerfon and Zappa for Metropolis random walks on submanifolds, where a reverse projection check is performed to enforce the reversibility of the algorithm for any timesteps and hence avoid biases in the invariant measure. We also provide a full mathematical analysis of such procedures, as well as numerical experiments demonstrating the importance of the reverse projection check on simple toy examples.

The analysis is based on the theory of transfinite electrical networks, but it requires that the transfinite network have a structure that generalizes local-finiteness for ordinary infinite networks. The shorting together of nodes of different ranks are allowed; this complicates transitions through such nodes but provides a considerably more general theory.

To this end, we formulated a system of ordinary differential equations that describe the malaria disease transmission dynamics in Tumaco and considered both vectorial and vertical transmission of disease. We performed a sensitivity analysis of parameters that allowed us to define the following control variables: indoor residual spraying (IRS), bed nets (BN), intermittent prophylactic treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) and antimalarial treatment (AT). Using previously identified control variables, we formulated an optimal control problem with different control strategies.

Different strategies have been proposed to solve this problem, however, rigorous analysis justifying their performance is missing. This paper suggests the Theoretical Spectral Curvature Clustering (TSCC) algorithm for solving the HLM problem and provides careful analysis to justify it. The TSCC algorithm is practically a combination of Govindu’s multi-way spectral clustering framework (CVPR 2005) and Ng et al.’s spectral clustering algorithm (NIPS 2001). The main result of this paper states that if the given data is sampled from a mixture of distributions concentrated around affine subspaces, then with high sampling probability the TSCC algorithm segments well the different underlying clusters. The goodness of clustering depends on the within-cluster errors, the between-clusters interaction, and a tuning parameter applied by TSCC.

The literature abounds in various approaches, all of which characterized by strengths and weaknesses. Among the others, Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) models give a more general and detailed description of the network structure. But, analytical computations might be prohibitive as soon as the network dimension increases, and numerical simulation could be nontrivial, time-consuming and very often impracticable as precise and quantitative information on model parameters are frequently unknown and hard to estimate from experimental data. Last but not least, they do not account for the intrinsic stochasticity of regulation. In the present paper we consider a class of ODE models with stochastic parameters. The proposed method separates the deterministic aspects from the stochastic ones. Under specific assumptions and conditions, all possible trajectories of an ODE model, where incomplete knowledge of parameter values is symbolically and qualitatively expressed by initial inequalities only, are simulated in a single run from an initial state. Then, the occurrence probability of each trajectory, characterized by a sequence of parameter inequalities, is computed by associating probability density functions with network parameters. As demonstrated by its application to the gene repressilator system, the method seems particularly promising in the design of synthetic networks.",Liliana Ironi1 & Ettore Lanzarone,Journal of Mathematical Biology,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-014-0765-z,"Gene regulatory networks,Nonlinear ODE models,Stochastic parameters,Qualitative simulation"
0,Universality of high-dimensional spanning forests and sandpiles,"We prove that the wired uniform spanning forest exhibits mean-field behaviour on a very large class of graphs, including every transitive graph of at least quintic volume growth and every bounded degree nonamenable graph. Several of our results are new even in the case of \(\mathbb {Z}^d\), \(d\ge 5\). In particular, we prove that every tree in the forest has spectral dimension 4/3 and walk dimension 3 almost surely, and that the critical exponents governing the intrinsic diameter and volume of the past of a vertex in the forest are 1 and 1/2 respectively. (The past of a vertex in the uniform spanning forest is the union of the vertex and the finite components that are disconnected from infinity when that vertex is deleted from the forest.) We obtain as a corollary that the critical exponent governing the extrinsic diameter of the past is 2 on any transitive graph of at least five dimensional polynomial growth, and is 1 on any bounded degree nonamenable graph. We deduce that the critical exponents describing the diameter and total number of topplings in an avalanche in the Abelian sandpile model are 2 and 1/2 respectively for any transitive graph with polynomial growth of dimension at least five, and are 1 and 1/2 respectively for any bounded degree nonamenable graph. In the case of \(\mathbb {Z}^d\), \(d\ge 5\), some of our results regarding critical exponents recover earlier results of Bhupatiraju et al. (Electron J Probab 22(85):51, 2017).

He wishes to build a searching path for reaching the object that starts from a given location and ends when reaching the object (or after searching the entire set with a false result). The objective is to find a searching path which will minimize the average searching time. We consider two scenarios for this problem: one when there is an unknown number of objects on the set and another when there is exactly one object on the set (the sum of probabilities is equal to 1).

0,Risk-Free Investments and Their Comparison with Simple Risky Strategies in Pension Insurance Model: Solving Singular Problems for Integro-Differential Equations,"AbstractA collective pension insurance (life annuity) model is investigated in the case of risk-free investments, i.e., when the whole surplus of an insurance company at each time is invested in risk-free asset (bank account). This strategy is compared with previously studied simple risky investment strategies, according to which, irrespective of the surplus of an insurance company, a constant positive fraction of this surplus at each time consists of risky assets (stocks), while the remaining fraction is invested in a bank account. The strategies are compared in terms of a traditional solvency criterion, namely, the survival probability. The original insurance model is dual to the classical Cramér–Lundberg model: the variation in the surplus over the portfolio of same-type contracts is described by the sum of a decreasing deterministic linear function corresponding to total pension payments and a compound Poisson process with positive jumps corresponding to the income gained by the company at the moments of transferring policyholders' property. In the case of an exponential jump size distribution and risk-free investments, it is shown that the survival probability regarded as a function of the initial surplus defined on the nonnegative real half-line is a solution of a singular problem for an integro-differential equation with a non-Volterra integral operator. The solution of the stated problem is obtained, its properties are analytically examined, and numerical examples are given. Examples are used to compare the influence exerted by risky and risk-free investments on the survival probability in the given model.","T. A. Belkina1, N. B. Konyukhova2 & B. V.

0,An optimal monotone contention resolution scheme for bipartite matchings via a polyhedral viewpoint,"Relaxation and rounding approaches became a standard and extremely versatile tool for constrained submodular function maximization. One of the most common rounding techniques in this context are contention resolution schemes. Such schemes round a fractional point by first rounding each coordinate independently, and then dropping some elements to reach a feasible set. Also the second step, where elements are dropped, is typically randomized. This leads to an additional source of randomization within the procedure, which can complicate the analysis. We suggest a different, polyhedral viewpoint to design contention resolution schemes, which avoids to deal explicitly with the randomization in the second step. This is achieved by focusing on the marginals of a dropping procedure. Apart from avoiding one source of randomization, our viewpoint allows for employing polyhedral techniques. Both can significantly simplify the construction and analysis of contention resolution schemes. We show how, through our framework, one can obtain an optimal monotone contention resolution scheme for bipartite matchings, which has a balancedness of 0.4762. So far, only very few results are known about optimality of monotone contention resolution schemes. Our contention resolution scheme for the bipartite case also improves the lower bound on the correlation gap for bipartite matchings. Furthermore, we derive a monotone contention resolution scheme for matchings that significantly improves over the previously best one. More precisely, we obtain a balancedness of 0.4326, improving on a prior 0.1997-balanced scheme. At the same time, our scheme implies that the currently best lower bound on the correlation gap for matchings is not tight. Our results lead to improved approximation factors for various constrained submodular function maximization problems over a combination of matching constraints with further constraints.","Simon Bruggmann

From retailers’ perspectives, the optimal offering strategies in unidirectional transshipments are analyzed on the basis of disruption risks in supply chains. With a focus on retailers’ profits, it develops the decision model of retailers’ orders in the dual sourcing mode and in the mode of capacity options, to maximize the retailers’ expected profits. The simulation shows that retailers’ optimal order decisions are not correlated with the joint disruption probability in the two order modes without service constraints; retailers’ optimal decisions are influenced by the joint disruption probability in the two order modes with service constraints, and the impact of the joint disruption probability of the primary suppliers’ optimal order from retailers differs in the two modes. Retailers’ order decisions in respect of backup suppliers are more sensitive to the changing volumes of transshipments. The contribution of this article is the impact of main parameters on retailers’ decisions, providing some guidance for enterprises to make order decisions.","Tong Shu1, Xirui Yang1,2, Shou Chen1, Shouyang Wang3, Kin Keung Lai4 & …Honglin Yang",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-018-6217-x,"Capacity options,disruption risks in supply chains,dual sourcing purchase,order strategies"

Following this framework, we here construct a reduced model from a small, efficiently computable random object called a sketch of a reduced model, using minimal residual methods. We introduce a sketched version of the minimal residual based projection as well as a novel nonlinear approximation method, where for each parameter value, the solution is approximated by minimal residual projection onto a subspace spanned by several vectors picked (online) from a dictionary of candidate basis vectors. It is shown that random sketching technique can improve not only efficiency but also numerical stability. A rigorous analysis of the conditions on the random sketch required to obtain a given accuracy is presented. These conditions may be ensured a priori with high probability by considering for the sketching matrix an oblivious embedding of sufficiently large size. Furthermore, a simple and reliable procedure for a posteriori verification of the quality of the sketch is provided. This approach can be used for certification of the approximation as well as for adaptive selection of the size of the random sketching matrix.","Oleg Balabanov1,2 & Anthony Nouy",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-020-09836-5,"Model order reduction,Reduced basis,Random sketching,Subspace embedding,Minimal residual methods,Sparse approximation,Dictionary"

Specifically, when it is only known that the expected value vector and the variance-covariance matrix of the input distribution belong to a given convex set, it is required that the failure probability of a structure should be no greater than a specified target value for any realization of the input distribution. We demonstrate that this distributionally-robust reliability constraint can be reduced equivalently to deterministic constraints. By using this reduction, we can handle a reliability-based design optimization problem under the distributionally-robust reliability constraint within the framework of deterministic optimization; in particular, nonlinear semidefinite programming. Two numerical examples are solved to demonstrate the relation between the optimal value and either the target reliability or the uncertainty magnitude.","Yoshihiro Kanno

By persistence of direction or internal bias we mean that the probability a particle will travel in a given direction need not be the same for all directions, but depends solely upon the particle's previous direction of motion. The external bias arises from an anisotropy of the medium or an external force on the particle. The problem is treated by considering that the net displacement of a particle arises from two factors, namely, that neither the probability of the particle traveling in any direction after turning nor the distance the particle travels in a given direction need be the same for all directions. A modified Fokker-Planck equation is first obtained using the assumptions that the particles have a distribution of travel times and speeds and that the average time of travel between turns need not be zero. The fional equation incopporating the assumption of a persistence of direction and an external bias is then derived.

This generalized phase retrieval (GPR) problem is a fundamental task in various disciplines and has been the subject of much recent investigation. Natural nonconvex heuristics often work remarkably well for GPR in practice, but lack clear theoretic explanations. In this paper, we take a step toward bridging this gap. We prove that when the measurement vectors \(\varvec{a}_k\)’s are generic (i.i.d. complex Gaussian) and numerous enough (\(m \ge C n \log ^3 n\)), with high probability, a natural least-squares formulation for GPR has the following benign geometric structure: (1) There are no spurious local minimizers, and all global minimizers are equal to the target signal \(\varvec{x}\), up to a global phase, and (2) the objective function has a negative directional curvature around each saddle point. This structure allows a number of iterative optimization methods to efficiently find a global minimizer, without special initialization.

0,Bound-constrained global optimization of functions with low effective dimensionality using multiple random embeddings,"We consider the bound-constrained global optimization of functions with low effective dimensionality, that are constant along an (unknown) linear subspace and only vary over the effective (complement) subspace. We aim to implicitly explore the intrinsic low dimensionality of the constrained landscape using feasible random embeddings, in order to understand and improve the scalability of algorithms for the global optimization of these special-structure problems. A reduced subproblem formulation is investigated that solves the original problem over a random low-dimensional subspace subject to affine constraints, so as to preserve feasibility with respect to the given domain. Under reasonable assumptions, we show that the probability that the reduced problem is successful in solving the original, full-dimensional problem is positive. Furthermore, in the case when the objective’s effective subspace is aligned with the coordinate axes, we provide an asymptotic bound on this success probability that captures its polynomial dependence on the effective and, surprisingly, ambient dimensions. We then propose X-REGO, a generic algorithmic framework that uses multiple random embeddings, solving the above reduced problem repeatedly, approximately and possibly, adaptively. Using the success probability of the reduced subproblems, we prove that X-REGO converges globally, with probability one, and linearly in the number of embeddings, to an \(\epsilon \)-neighbourhood of a constrained global minimizer. Our numerical experiments on special structure functions illustrate our theoretical findings and the improved scalability of X-REGO variants when coupled with state-of-the-art global—and even local—optimization solvers for the subproblems.

Our framework utilizes random models of an objective function f(x), obtained from stochastic observations of the function or its gradient. Our method also utilizes estimates of function values to gauge progress that is being made. The convergence analysis relies on requirements that these models and these estimates are sufficiently accurate with high enough, but fixed, probability. Beyond these conditions, no assumptions are made on how these models and estimates are generated. Under these general conditions we show an almost sure global convergence of the method to a first order stationary point. In the second part of the paper, we present examples of generating sufficiently accurate random models under biased or unbiased noise assumptions. Lastly, we present some computational results showing the benefits of the proposed method compared to existing approaches that are based on sample averaging or stochastic gradients.","R. Chen1, M.

0,On a finite-buffer bulk-service queue with disasters,We deal with a finite-buffer bulk-service queue with disasters. The arrival streams of units and disasters are Markovian arrival processes (MAPs). We study the stationary distribution of the embedded Markov chain at post-departure epochs. The block structure allows us to derive a general approach amenable to numerical calculation following results of the theory for censored Markov chains and level-dependent quasi-birth-and-death processes. We give tractable analytical formulas for the departure process and the stationary distributions of the system state at arbitrary and pre-arrival epochs. The effect of the disaster stream on certain probabilistic descriptors is graphically illustrated.,A.

0,The contact process on finite homogeneous trees," Let ?
d
 be a homogeneous tree in which every vertex has d + 1 neighbours, where d≥ 2. The contact process on such a tree is known to have three distinct phases. We consider the process on a finite subtree, namely the rooted tree of depth h and branching factor d, and relate the behaviour of the process on the infinite tree to its behaviour on the finite tree for large h. In the phase of strong survival, we show that with probability ɛ independent of h, the process on the subtree starting from a single infection survives for a time which is doubly exponential in h and almost exponential in the number of vertices of the finite tree. In the phase of weak survival on the infinite tree, the survival time on the finite tree is approximately linear in h. In the phase of no survival, the survival time on the finite tree is linear in h if one starts with all vertices initially infected, and bounded by a random variable (independent of h) with an exponential tail if one starts from a single infection.",Alan Stacey,Probability Theory and Related Fields,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004400100149,"Survival Time,Rooted Tree,Distinct Phasis,Strong Survival,Homogeneous Tree"

0,Asymptotic coupling and a general form of Harris’ theorem with applications to stochastic delay equations,"There are many Markov chains on infinite dimensional spaces whose one-step transition kernels are mutually singular when starting from different initial conditions. We give results which prove unique ergodicity under minimal assumptions on one hand and the existence of a spectral gap under conditions reminiscent of Harris’ theorem. The first uses the existence of couplings which draw the solutions together as time goes to infinity. Such “asymptotic couplings” were central to (Mattingly and Sinai in Comm Math Phys 219(3):523–565, 2001; Mattingly in Comm Math Phys 230(3):461–462, 2002; Hairer in Prob Theory Relat Field 124:345–380, 2002; Bakhtin and Mattingly in Commun Contemp Math 7:553–582, 2005) on which this work builds. As in Bakhtin and Mattingly (2005) the emphasis here is on stochastic differential delay equations. Harris’ celebrated theorem states that if a Markov chain admits a Lyapunov function whose level sets are “small” (in the sense that transition probabilities are uniformly bounded from below), then it admits a unique invariant measure and transition probabilities converge towards it at exponential speed. This convergence takes place in a total variation norm, weighted by the Lyapunov function. A second aim of this article is to replace the notion of a “small set” by the much weaker notion of a “d-small set,” which takes the topology of the underlying space into account via a distance-like function d. With this notion at hand, we prove an analogue to Harris’ theorem, where the convergence takes place in a Wasserstein-like distance weighted again by the Lyapunov function. This abstract result is then applied to the framework of stochastic delay equations. In this framework, the usual theory of Harris chains does not apply, since there are natural examples for which there exist no small sets (except for sets consisting of only one point). This gives a solution to the long-standing open problem of finding natural conditions under which a stochastic delay equation admits at most one invariant measure and transition probabilities converge to it.","M.

0,"Free Component Analysis: Theory, Algorithms and Applications","We describe a method for unmixing mixtures of freely independent random variables in a manner analogous to the independent component analysis (ICA)-based method for unmixing independent random variables from their additive mixtures. Random matrices play the role of free random variables in this context so the method we develop, which we call free component analysis (FCA), unmixes matrices from additive mixtures of matrices. Thus, while the mixing model is standard, the novelty and difference in unmixing performance comes from the introduction of a new statistical criteria, derived from free probability theory, that quantify freeness analogous to how kurtosis and entropy quantify independence. We describe the theory, the various algorithms, and compare FCA to vanilla ICA which does not account for spatial or temporal structure. We highlight why the statistical criteria make FCA also vanilla despite its matricial underpinnings and show that FCA performs comparably to, and sometimes better than, (vanilla) ICA in every application, such as image and speech unmixing, where ICA has been known to succeed.

0,Optimal row and column ordering to improve table interpretation using estimation of distribution algorithms,"A common information representation task in research as well as educational and statistical practice is to comprehensively and intuitively express data in two-dimensional tables. Examples include tables in scientific papers, as well as reports and the popular press.Data is often simple enough for users to reorder. In many other cases though, there are complex data patterns that make finding the best re-arrangement of rows and columns for optimum readability a tough problem.We propose that row and column ordering should be regarded as a combinatorial optimization problem and solved using evolutionary computation techniques. The use of genetic algorithms has already been proposed in the literature. This paper proposes for the first time the use of estimation of distribution algorithms for table ordering. We also propose alternative ways of representing the problem in order to reduce its dimensionality. By learning a selective naive Bayes classifier, we can find out how to jointly combine the parameters of these algorithms to get good table orderings.

The method is applied to sequential and parallel update versions of each of the four variants of discrete time TASEP (with Bernoulli and geometric jumps, and with block and push dynamics) which have determinantal transition probabilities; to continuous time PushASEP; and to a version of TASEP with generalized update. In all cases, multipoint distribution functions are expressed in terms of a Fredholm determinant with an explicit kernel involving hitting times of certain random walks to a curve defined by the initial data of the system. The method is further applied to systems of interacting caterpillars, an extension of the discrete time TASEP models which generalizes sequential and parallel updates.","Konstantin Matetski

The latter evolution equation has previously appeared in different contexts (e.g. on the torus it can be be identified with the Ricci flow). This leads to algorithmic approximations of the potential of the Optimal Transport map, as well as the Optimal Transport distance, with explicit bounds on the arithmetic complexity of the construction and the approximation errors. As applications we obtain explicit schemes of nearly linear complexity, at each iteration, for optimal transport on the torus and the two-sphere, as well as the far-field antenna problem.

While it had the significant advantage of dealing with linear equations, the approximations involved may have led to several non-physical predictions. This work is a continuation of Curtiss and Bird (1996) in that it obtains the corresponding non-linear configurational probability density equation in dimensionless form without the linear gradient approximations for the temperature field and Brownian forces. It does so for incompressible diluted polymer solutions with polymer molecules being modeled as FENE (Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic) chains. Next we prove the existence of temperature dependent, positive variational solutions for the probability density equation of the FENE model.

0,Infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations and tail \(\sigma \)-fields,"We present general theorems solving the long-standing problem of the existence and pathwise uniqueness of strong solutions of infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations (ISDEs) called interacting Brownian motions. These ISDEs describe the dynamics of infinitely-many Brownian particles moving in \( {\mathbb {R}}^d \) with free potential \( \varPhi \) and mutual interaction potential \( \varPsi \). We apply the theorems to essentially all interaction potentials of Ruelle’s class such as the Lennard-Jones 6-12 potential and Riesz potentials, and to logarithmic potentials appearing in random matrix theory. We solve ISDEs of the Ginibre interacting Brownian motion and the sine\(_{\beta }\) interacting Brownian motion with \( \beta = 1,2,4\). We also use the theorems in separate papers for the Airy and Bessel interacting Brownian motions. One of the critical points for proving the general theorems is to establish a new formulation of solutions of ISDEs in terms of tail \( \sigma \)-fields of labeled path spaces consisting of trajectories of infinitely-many particles. These formulations are equivalent to the original notions of solutions of ISDEs, and more feasible to treat in infinite dimensions.

For example, if bothU andV drift away from the boundary, then the chain will eventually spend all of its time on one side of the boundary; we show that in the integer-valued case, the probability of ending up on the left side, viewed as a function of γ, is typically discontinuous at every rational number in a certain interval and continuous everywhere else. Another result is that ifU andV are integer-valued and drift toward the boundary, then when viewed from the moving boundary, the chain has a unique invariant distribution, which is absolutely continuous whenever γ is irrational.",Neal Madras1 & David Tanny,Israel Journal of Mathematics,1994,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02937518,"Markov Chain,Probability Measure,Random Walk,Invariant Measure,Invariant Probability Measure"

0,Randomized anisotropic transform for nonlinear dimensionality reduction,"An innovative method is introduced in this paper to significantly increase computational speed and to reduce memory usage, when applied to nonlinear methods and algorithms for dimensionality reduction (DR). Due to the incapability of linear DR methods in the preservation of data geometry, the need of effective nonlinear approaches has recently attracted the attention of many researchers, particularly from the Mathematics and Computer Science communities. The common theme of the current nonlinear DR approaches is formulation of certain matrices, called dimensionality reduction kernels (DRK) in terms of the data points, followed by performing spectral decomposition. Hence, for datasets of large size with data points that lie in some high dimensional space, the matrix dimension of the DRK is very large. Typical examples for the need of very high dimensional DRK arise from such applications as processing multispectral imagery data, searching desired text documentary data in the internet, and recognizing human faces from given libraries. For such and many other applications, the matrix dimension of the DRK is so large that computation for carrying out spectral decomposition of the DRK often encounters various difficulties, not only due to the need of significantly large read-only memory (ROM), but also due to computational instability. The main objective of this paper is to introduce the notion of the anisotropic transform (AT) and to develop its corresponding effective and efficient computational algorithms by integrating random embedding with the AT to formulate the randomized anisotropic transform (RAT), in order to reduce the size of the DRK significantly, while preserving local geometries of the given datasets. Illustrations with various examples will also be given in this paper to demonstrate that RAT algorithms dramatically reduce the ROM and CPU requirement, and thus allow fast processing, even on PC and potentially for handhold devices as well.",Charles K.

In practice, some transition probabilities may be uncertain. The goals of the present study are to find the robust range for a certain optimal policy and to obtain value intervals of exact transition probabilities. Our research yields powerful contributions for Markov decision processes (MDPs) with uncertain transition probabilities. We first propose a method for estimating unknown transition probabilities based on maximum likelihood. Since the estimation may be far from accurate, and the highest expected total reward of the MDP may be sensitive to these transition probabilities, we analyze the robustness of an optimal policy and propose an approach for robust analysis. After giving the definition of a robust optimal policy with uncertain transition probabilities represented as sets of numbers, we formulate a model to obtain the optimal policy. Finally, we define the value intervals of the exact transition probabilities and construct models to determine the lower and upper bounds.

The time-dependence of the probability distribution is also studied: through a Gaussian approximation for general n when the boundary at n = 0 has little effect, and by calculating P(0, t), the probability that no patches are occupied at time t, by using a linearization procedure. These analytic calculations are supplemented by carrying out numerical solutions of the master equation and simulations of the stochastic process.

After studying two spatially extended versions of this nonspatial metapopulation model—a lattice metapopulation model and a spatially realistic model—we conclude that our analytical formula for the mean extinction time is generally applicable to those metapopulations which are really endangered, where extinction dynamics dominates over local colonization processes. The time evolution and, in particular, the scope of our analytical results, are studied by comparing these different models with the analytical approach for various values of the parameters: the rates of immigration from the mainland, the rates of colonization and extinction, and the number of patches making up the metapopulation.","David Alonso1,2 & Alan McKane",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1006/bulm.2002.0307,"Master Equation,Colonization Rate,Extinction Rate,Patch Area,Extinction Dynamic"

First, we give an asymptotic approximation to the probability density for the state of the system. This density is used to compute several quantities which describe the influence of the noise on the transition from the silent to the active phase. Second, we also use a multiscale method to provide a reduced system for analysing the effect of noise on the transition out of the active phase. The combination of these two approaches results in a new framework for a quantitative description of how noise shortens the burst cycle, which measures the significant influence of small noise. For the stochastic spine model, this study suggests that small amplitude noise can significantly influence the activity-dependent morphological plasticity of dendritic spines.

To this model we add a rate at which individuals are tested, and once an infectious individual tests positive it is isolated and each of their contacts are traced and tested independently with some fixed probability. If such a traced individual tests positive it is isolated, and the contact tracing is iterated. This model is analysed using large population approximations, both for the early stage of the epidemic when the “to-be-traced components” of the epidemic behaves like a branching process, and for the main stage of the epidemic where the process of to-be-traced components converges to a deterministic process defined by a system of differential equations. These approximations are used to quantify the effect of testing and of contact tracing on the effective reproduction numbers (for the components as well as for the individuals), the probability of a major outbreak, and the final fraction getting infected. Using numerical illustrations when rates of infection and natural recovery are fixed, it is shown that Test-and-Trace strategy is effective in reducing the reproduction number. Surprisingly, the reproduction number for the branching process of components is not monotonically decreasing in the tracing probability, but the individual reproduction number is conjectured to be monotonic as expected. Further, in the situation where individuals also self-report for testing, the tracing probability is more influential than the screening rate (measured by the fraction infected being screened).","Dongni Zhang

0,Convergence rates of large-time sensitivities with the Hansen–Scheinkman decomposition,"This paper investigates the large-time asymptotic behavior of the sensitivities of cash flows. In quantitative finance, the price of a cash flow is expressed in terms of a pricing operator of a Markov diffusion process. We study the extent to which the pricing operator is affected by small changes of the underlying Markov diffusion. The main idea is a partial differential equation (PDE) representation of the pricing operator by incorporating the Hansen–Scheinkman decomposition method. The sensitivities of the cash flows and their large-time convergence rates can be represented via simple expressions in terms of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the pricing operator. Furthermore, compared to the work of Park (Finance Stoch 4:773–825, 2018), more detailed convergence rates are provided. In addition, we discuss the application of our results to three practical problems: utility maximization, entropic risk measures, and bond prices. Finally, as examples, explicit results for several market models such as the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) model, 3/2 model and constant elasticity of variance (CEV) model are presented.

0,Implied fractional hazard rates and default risk distributions,"Default probability distributions are often defined in terms of their conditional default probability distribution, or their hazard rate. By their definition, they imply a unique probability density function. The applications of default probability distributions are varied, including the risk premium model used to price default bonds, reliability measurement models, insurance, etc. Fractional probability density functions (FPD), however, are not in general conventional probability density functions (Tapiero and Vallois, Physica A,. Stat. Mech. Appl. 462:1161–1177, 2016). As a result, a fractional FPD does not define a fractional hazard rate. However, a fractional hazard rate implies a unique and conventional FPD. For example, an exponential distribution fractional hazard rate implies a Weibull probability density function while, a fractional exponential probability distribution is not a conventional distribution and therefore does not define a fractional hazard rate. The purpose of this paper consists of defining fractional hazard rates implied fractional distributions and to highlight their usefulness to granular default risk distributions. Applications of such an approach are varied. For example, pricing default bonds, pricing complex insurance contracts, as well as complex network risks of various granularity, that have well defined and quantitative definitions of their hazard rates.",Charles S.

Three estimators are presented that address various levels of uncertainty while simultaneously improving worker assignments. Specifically, each estimator is designed to utilize the unbiased and consistent properties of the sample mean to estimate the expected job value, while suppressing high variance effects during start-up. The key contribution is that closed-loop decision policies involving past job value observations can responsively adapt to changing environments and improve the overall reward resulting from pairing workers with jobs. Examples of applications that can benefit from these results include aviation passenger screening and the real estate market, as well as applications of the stochastic knapsack problem.",Adrian J.

0,"Near-critical 2D percolation with heavy-tailed impurities, forest fires and frozen percolation","We introduce a new percolation model on planar lattices. First, impurities (“holes”) are removed independently from the lattice. On the remaining part, we then consider site percolation with some parameter p close to the critical value \(p_c\). The mentioned impurities are not only microscopic, but allowed to be mesoscopic (“heavy-tailed”, in some sense). For technical reasons (the proofs of our results use quite precise bounds on critical exponents in Bernoulli percolation), our study focuses on the triangular lattice. We determine explicitly the range of parameters in the distribution of impurities for which the connectivity properties of percolation remain of the same order as without impurities, for distances below a certain characteristic length. This generalizes a celebrated result by Kesten for classical near-critical percolation (which can be viewed as critical percolation with single-site impurities). New challenges arise from the potentially large impurities. This generalization, which is also of independent interest, turns out to be crucial to study models of forest fires (or epidemics). In these models, all vertices are initially vacant, and then become occupied at rate 1. If an occupied vertex is hit by lightning, which occurs at a very small rate \(\zeta \), its entire occupied cluster burns immediately, so that all its vertices become vacant. Our results for percolation with impurities are instrumental in analyzing the behavior of these forest fire models near and beyond the critical time (i.e. the time after which, in a forest without fires, an infinite cluster of trees emerges). In particular, we prove (so far, for the case when burnt trees do not recover) the existence of a sequence of “exceptional scales” (functions of \(\zeta \)). For forests on boxes with such side lengths, the impact of fires does not vanish in the limit as \(\zeta \searrow 0\). This surprising behavior, related to the non-monotonicity of these processes, was not predicted in the physics literature.

0,A review on probabilistic graphical models in evolutionary computation,"Thanks to their inherent properties, probabilistic graphical models are one of the prime candidates for machine learning and decision making tasks especially in uncertain domains. Their capabilities, like representation, inference and learning, if used effectively, can greatly help to build intelligent systems that are able to act accordingly in different problem domains. Evolutionary algorithms is one such discipline that has employed probabilistic graphical models to improve the search for optimal solutions in complex problems. This paper shows how probabilistic graphical models have been used in evolutionary algorithms to improve their performance in solving complex problems.

0,Efficient PAC Learning for Episodic Tasks with Acyclic State Spaces,"This paper considers the problem of computing an optimal policy for a Markov decision process, under lack of complete a priori knowledge of (1) the branching probability distributions determining the evolution of the process state upon the execution of the different actions, and (2) the probability distributions characterizing the immediate rewards returned by the environment as a result of the execution of these actions at different states of the process. In addition, it is assumed that the underlying process evolves in a repetitive, episodic manner, with each episode starting from a well-defined initial state and evolving over an acyclic state space. A novel efficient algorithm for this problem is proposed, and its convergence properties and computational complexity are rigorously characterized in the formal framework of computational learning theory.

0,Birth/birth-death processes and their computable transition probabilities with biological applications,"Birth-death processes track the size of a univariate population, but many biological systems involve interaction between populations, necessitating models for two or more populations simultaneously. A lack of efficient methods for evaluating finite-time transition probabilities of bivariate processes, however, has restricted statistical inference in these models. Researchers rely on computationally expensive methods such as matrix exponentiation or Monte Carlo approximation, restricting likelihood-based inference to small systems, or indirect methods such as approximate Bayesian computation. In this paper, we introduce the birth/birth-death process, a tractable bivariate extension of the birth-death process, where rates are allowed to be nonlinear. We develop an efficient algorithm to calculate its transition probabilities using a continued fraction representation of their Laplace transforms. Next, we identify several exemplary models arising in molecular epidemiology, macro-parasite evolution, and infectious disease modeling that fall within this class, and demonstrate advantages of our proposed method over existing approaches to inference in these models. Notably, the ubiquitous stochastic susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model falls within this class, and we emphasize that computable transition probabilities newly enable direct inference of parameters in the SIR model. We also propose a very fast method for approximating the transition probabilities under the SIR model via a novel branching process simplification, and compare it to the continued fraction representation method with application to the 17th century plague in Eyam. Although the two methods produce similar maximum a posteriori estimates, the branching process approximation fails to capture the correlation structure in the joint posterior distribution.","Lam Si Tung Ho1, Jason Xu2, Forrest W.

0,Reconstruction and Subgaussian Operators in Asymptotic Geometric Analysis,"We present a randomized method to approximate any vector \(\upsilon\) from a set \(T \subset {\mathbb{R}}^n\). The data one is given is the set T, vectors \((X_i)^{k}_{i=1}\) of \({\mathbb{R}}^n\) and k scalar products \((\langle X_i, \upsilon\rangle)^{k}_{i=1}\), where \((X_i)^k_{i=1}\) are i.i.d. isotropic subgaussian random vectors in \({\mathbb{R}}^n\), and \(k \ll n\). We show that with high probability, any \(y \in T\) for which \((\langle X_i, y\rangle)^k_{i=1}\) is close to the data vector \((\langle X_i, \upsilon\rangle)^k_{i=1}\) will be a good approximation of \(\upsilon\), and that the degree of approximation is determined by a natural geometric parameter associated with the set T.We also investigate a random method to identify exactly any vector which has a relatively short support using linear subgaussian measurements as above. It turns out that our analysis, when applied to {−1, 1}-valued vectors with i.i.d. symmetric entries, yields new information on the geometry of faces of a random {−1, 1}-polytope; we show that a k- dimensional random {−1, 1}-polytope with n vertices is m-neighborly for \(m \leq ck/ log(c^{\prime}n/k).\)

It addresses the problem of maximizing the probability of arriving on time. Given a current location (node), the goal is to identify the next node to visit so that the probability of arriving at the destination by time t or sooner is maximized, given the probability density functions for the link travel times. The Bellman principle of optimality is applied to formulate the mathematical model of this problem. The unknown functions describing the maximum probability of arriving on time are estimated accurately for a few sample networks by using the Picard method of successive approximations. The maximum probabilities can be evaluated without enumerating the network paths. The Laplace transform and its numerical inversion are introduced to reduce the computational cost of evaluating the convolution integrals that result from the successive approximation procedure.","Y.

0,Quasi-steady State Reduction of Molecular Motor-Based Models of Directed Intermittent Search,"We present a quasi-steady state reduction of a linear reaction-hyperbolic master equation describing the directed intermittent search for a hidden target by a motor-driven particle moving on a one-dimensional filament track. The particle is injected at one end of the track and randomly switches between stationary search phases and mobile nonsearch phases that are biased in the anterograde direction. There is a finite possibility that the particle fails to find the target due to an absorbing boundary at the other end of the track. Such a scenario is exemplified by the motor-driven transport of vesicular cargo to synaptic targets located on the axon or dendrites of a neuron. The reduced model is described by a scalar Fokker–Planck (FP) equation, which has an additional inhomogeneous decay term that takes into account absorption by the target. The FP equation is used to compute the probability of finding the hidden target (hitting probability) and the corresponding conditional mean first passage time (MFPT) in terms of the effective drift velocity V, diffusivity D, and target absorption rate λ of the random search. The quasi-steady state reduction determines V, D, and λ in terms of the various biophysical parameters of the underlying motor transport model. We first apply our analysis to a simple 3-state model and show that our quasi-steady state reduction yields results that are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations of the full system under physiologically reasonable conditions. We then consider a more complex multiple motor model of bidirectional transport, in which opposing motors compete in a “tug-of-war”, and use this to explore how ATP concentration might regulate the delivery of cargo to synaptic targets.","Jay M.

The problem of decision optimization under probabilistic constraint is thus an issue needs to be addressed urgently. In this paper, we consider to develop an event-based approach which can solve the probabilistic constrained decision problems in discrete events dynamic systems. The framework of the event-based optimization is first introduced, and then with the methodology of the performance sensitivity analysis, we present an online event-based policy iteration algorithm based on the derived performance gradient formula. We apply the event-based idea and propose the concept of “risk state”, “risk event” and “risk index” which can be used to better describe the nature of the probabilistic constrained problem.

0,Optimal investment strategies for pension funds with regulation-conform dynamic pension payment management in the absence of guarantees,"In this article we consider the post-retirement phase optimization problem for a specific pension product in Germany that comes without guarantees. The continuous-time optimization problem is defined consisting of two specialties: first, we have a product-specific pension adjustment mechanism based on a certain capital coverage ratio which stipulates compulsory pension adjustments if the pension fund is underfunded or significantly overfunded. Second, due to the retiree’s fear of and aversion against pension reductions, we introduce a total wealth distribution to an investment portfolio and a buffer portfolio to lower the probability of future potential pension shortenings. The target functional in the optimization, that is to be maximized, is the client’s expected accumulated utility from the stochastic future pension cash flows. The optimization outcome is the optimal investment strategy in the proposed model. Due to the inherent complexity of the continuous-time framework, the discrete-time version of the optimization problem is considered and solved via the Bellman principle. In addition, for computational reasons, a policy function iteration algorithm is introduced to find a stationary solution to the problem in a computationally efficient and elegant fashion.

0,Extremal Lyapunov exponents: an invariance principle and applications,"We propose a new approach to analyzing dynamical systems that combine hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic (“center”) behavior, e.g. partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. A number of applications illustrate its power.We find that any ergodic automorphism of the 4-torus with two eigenvalues in the unit circle is stably Bernoulli among symplectic maps. Indeed, any nearby symplectic map has no zero Lyapunov exponents, unless it is volume preserving conjugate to the automorphism itself. Another main application is to accessible skew-product maps preserving area on the fibers. We prove, in particular, that if the genus of the fiber is at least 2 then the Lyapunov exponents must be different from zero and vary continuously with the map.These, and other dynamical conclusions, originate from a general Invariance Principle we prove in here. It is formulated in terms of smooth cocycles, that is, fiber bundle morphisms acting by diffeomorphisms on the fibers. The extremal Lyapunov exponents measure the smallest and largest exponential rates of growth of the derivative along the fibers. The Invariance Principle states that if these two numbers coincide then the fibers carry some amount of structure which is transversely invariant, that is, invariant under certain canonical families of homeomorphisms between fibers.","Artur Avila1,2 & Marcelo Viana",Inventiones mathematicae,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-010-0243-1,"Lyapunov Exponent,Periodic Point,Invariance Principle,Volume Preserve,Invariant Probability Measure"

Slater type conditions have been widely used for strong duality (zero dual gap) when the ambiguity set is defined through moments. In this paper, we investigate effective ways for verifying the Slater type conditions and introduce other conditions which are based on lower semicontinuity of the optimal value function of the inner maximization problem. Moreover, we propose two discretization schemes for solving the DRO with one for the dualized DRO and the other directly through the ambiguity set of the DRO. In the absence of strong duality, the discretization scheme via Lagrange duality may provide an upper bound for the optimal value of the DRO whereas the direct discretization approach provides a lower bound. Two cutting plane schemes are consequently proposed: one for the discretized dualized DRO and the other for the minimax DRO with discretized ambiguity set. Convergence analysis is presented for the approximation schemes in terms of the optimal value, optimal solutions and stationary points.

The variety of competing models is vast, but two stand out by virtue of their popularity: the reaction–diffusion master equation and Brownian dynamics. In this review, we critically address a number of open questions surrounding these models: How can they be justified physically? How do they relate to each other? How do they fit into the wider landscape of chemical models, ranging from the rate equations to molecular dynamics? This review assumes no prior knowledge of modelling chemical kinetics and should be accessible to a wide range of readers.",Stephen Smith1 & Ramon Grima,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-018-0443-1,"Reaction–diffusion master equation,Spatial models,Brownian dynamics"
0,Probabilization of Logics: Completeness and Decidability,"The probabilization of a logic system consists of enriching the language (the formulas) and the semantics (the models) with probabilistic features. Such an operation is said to be exogenous if the enrichment is done on top, without internal changes to the structure, and is called endogenous otherwise. These two different enrichments can be applied simultaneously to the language and semantics of a same logic. We address the problem of studying the transference of metaproperties, such as completeness and decidability, to the exogenous probabilization of an abstract logic system. First, we setup the necessary framework to handle the probabilization of a satisfaction system by proving transference results within a more general context. In this setup, we define a combination mechanism of logics through morphisms and prove sufficient condition to guarantee completeness and decidability. Then, we demonstrate that probabilization is a special case of this exogenous combination method, and that it fulfills the general conditions to obtain transference of completeness and decidability. Finally, we motivate the applicability of our technique by analyzing the probabilization of the linear temporal logic over Markov chains, which constitutes an endogenous probabilization. The results are obtained first by studying the exogenous semantics, and then by establishing an equivalence with the original probabilization given by Markov chains.",Pedro Baltazar,Logica Universalis,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11787-013-0087-8,03B62 (03B48)
0,Generic properties of combinatory maps: Neutral networks of RNA secondary structures,"Random graph theory is used to model and analyse the relationship between sequences and secondary structures of RNA molecules, which are understood as mappings from sequence space into shape space. These maps are non-invertible since there are always many orders of magnitude more sequences than structures. Sequences folding into identical structures formneutral networks. A neutral network is embedded in the set of sequences that arecompatible with the given structure. Networks are modeled as graphs and constructed by random choice of vertices from the space of compatible sequences. The theory characterizes neutral networks by the mean fraction of neutral neighbors (λ). The networks are connected and percolate sequence space if the fraction of neutral nearest neighbors exceeds a threshold value (λ>λ*). Below threshold (λ<λ*), the networks are partitioned into a largest “giant” component and several smaller components. Structure are classified as “common” or “rare” according to the sizes of their pre-images, i.e. according to the fractions of sequences folding into them. The neutral networks of any pair of two different common structures almost touch each other, and, as expressed by the conjecture ofshape space covering sequences folding into almost all common structures, can be found in a small ball of an arbitrary location in sequence space. The results from random graph theory are compared to data obtained by folding large samples of RNA sequences. Differences are explained in terms of specific features of RNA molecular structures.","Christian Reidys1,2, Peter F.

We assume that the logarithm of the price dynamics is driven by a so-called sticky double exponential jump diffusion process. In particular, the price clustering is incorporated by time changing the jump diffusion process, and the jump risk is described through a Poisson stochastic integral related to the compound Poisson process with double exponential jumps. Under such a model, we study the default events in the structural credit risk framework. The explicit solutions of Laplace transforms associated with default times are obtained. Based on the derived results, we numerically analyze the effects of the price clustering and the jump risk on the distributions of default times and on the bond’s credit spreads.","Shiyu Song1, Yongjin Wang2 & Guangli Xu

0,The early evolution of the H-free process,"The H-free process, for some fixed graph H, is the random graph process defined by starting with an empty graph on n vertices and then adding edges one at a time, chosen uniformly at random subject to the constraint that no H subgraph is formed. Let G be the random maximal H-free graph obtained at the end of the process. When H is strictly 2-balanced, we show that for some c>0, with high probability as n→∞, the minimum degree in G is at least \(cn^{1-(v_{H}-2)/(e_{H}-1)}(\log n)^{1/(e_{H}-1)}\).

The problem is known to be computationally hard, so our algorithm is exponential in the worst case, but it is faster than the algorithms used so far and it performs well on average. The main idea is to use a bidirectional breadth-first-search and radix (Patricia) tries to store and compare subsets. A good performance is due to a number of heuristics we apply and describe here in a suitable detail. We give both theoretical and practical arguments showing that the effective branching factor is considerably reduced. As a practical test we perform an experimental study of the length of the shortest reset word for random automata with up to \(n=350\) states and up to \(k=10\) input letters. In particular, we obtain a new estimation of the expected length of the shortest reset word \({\approx \,}2.5\sqrt{n-5}\) for binary automata and show that the error of this estimate is sufficiently small. Experiments for automata with more than two input letters show certain trends with the same general pattern.","Andrzej Kisielewicz1, Jakub Kowalski1 & Marek Szykuła",Journal of Combinatorial Optimization,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10878-013-9682-0,"Synchronizing automaton,Synchronizing word,Černý conjecture"
0,Eisenstein Series and Equidistribution of Lebesgue Probability Measures on Compact Leaves of the Horocycle Foliations of Bianchi 3-Orbifolds,"Inspired by the works of Zagier (Eisenstein series and the Riemann zeta function, Automorphic forms, representation theory and arithmetic, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay 1979, Springer, New York, 1981) and Sarnak (Commun Pure Appl Math, 34:719–739, 1981), we study the probability measures \(\nu (t)\) with support on the flat tori which are the compact orbits of the maximal unipotent subgroup acting holomorphically on the positive orthonormal frame bundle \(\mathcal {F}({M}_D)\) of 3-dimensional hyperbolic Bianchi orbifolds \({M}_D=\mathbb {H}^3/\widetilde{\Gamma }_D\), of finite volume and with only one cusp. Here \(\widetilde{\Gamma }_D\subset \mathbf {PSL}(2,\mathbb {C})\) is the Bianchi group corresponding to the imaginary quadratic field \(\mathbb {Q}(\sqrt{-D})\). Thus \(\widetilde{\Gamma }_D\) consist of Möbius transformations with coefficients in the ring of integers of \(\mathbb {Q}(\sqrt{-D})\). If \(l \in \mathbb {N}\), \(k,m \in \mathbb {Z}\) are such that \(k,m \in [-l,l]\), the appropriate Eisenstein series \(\widehat{E}_{km}^l ( g,s)\) (which are defined and analytic for \(\mathrm {Re}(s) \ge 1\)) admit an analytic continuation to all of \(\mathbb {C}\), except when \(l=k=m=0\) in which case there is a pole for \(s=1\). Using this fact we show that the elliptic curves which are the compact orbits of the complex horocycle flow \(h_T:\mathcal {F}({M}_D)\longrightarrow \mathcal {F}({M}_D)\) (\(T \in \mathbb {C}\)) are expanded by the real geodesic flow \(g_t, t\in \mathbb {R}\), and they become equidistributed in \(\mathcal {F}({M}_D)\) with respect to the normalized Haar measure as \(t \longrightarrow \infty \). This follows from the equidistribution of Lebesgue probability measures on compact leaves of the horocycle foliations in the orthonormal frame bundle of \(M_D\), which is equal to the quotient \(\mathbf {PSL}(2,\mathbb {C})/\widetilde{\Gamma }_D\). The same equidistribution property occurs for the spin bundle of \(M_D\) which is the homogeneous space \(\mathbf {SL}(2,\mathbb {C})/\Gamma _D\), where \(\Gamma _D\) is the Bianchi subgroup in \(\mathbf {SL}(2,\mathbb {C})\) consisting of matrices with entries in the ring of integers of \(\mathbb {Q}(\sqrt{-D})\). Our method uses the theory of spherical harmonics in the unit tangent bundle orbifold \(T_1(M_D)={\mathbf {SO}}(2){\backslash }\mathbf {PSL}(2,\mathbb {C})/\widetilde{\Gamma }_D=T_1(\mathbb {H}^3)/{\Gamma ^*_D}\), where \({\Gamma ^*_D}\) is the action of \({\widetilde{\Gamma }}_D\) on the unit tangent bundle of \(\mathbb {H}^3\) via the differential of the elements of \(\widetilde{\Gamma }_D\).","Otto Romero1 & Alberto Verjovsky

0,Efficient random graph matching via degree profiles,"Random graph matching refers to recovering the underlying vertex correspondence between two random graphs with correlated edges; a prominent example is when the two random graphs are given by Erdős-Rényi graphs \(G(n,\frac{d}{n})\). This can be viewed as an average-case and noisy version of the graph isomorphism problem. Under this model, the maximum likelihood estimator is equivalent to solving the intractable quadratic assignment problem. This work develops an \({\widetilde{O}}(n d^2+n^2)\)-time algorithm which perfectly recovers the true vertex correspondence with high probability, provided that the average degree is at least \(d = \varOmega (\log ^2 n)\) and the two graphs differ by at most \(\delta = O( \log ^{-2}(n) )\) fraction of edges. For dense graphs and sparse graphs, this can be improved to \(\delta = O( \log ^{-2/3}(n) )\) and \(\delta = O( \log ^{-2}(d) )\) respectively, both in polynomial time. The methodology is based on appropriately chosen distance statistics of the degree profiles (empirical distribution of the degrees of neighbors). Before this work, the best known result achieves \(\delta =O(1)\) and \(n^{o(1)} \le d \le n^c\) for some constant c with an \(n^{O(\log n)}\)-time algorithm and \(\delta ={{\widetilde{O}}}((d/n)^4)\) and \(d = {\widetilde{\varOmega }}(n^{4/5})\) with a polynomial-time algorithm.","Jian Ding1, Zongming Ma1, Yihong Wu

In this paper, we propose a novel method for random vibration analysis of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) vibroimpact systems with bilateral barriers under Gaussian white noise excitations. A periodic approximate transformation is employed to convert the equations of the motion to a continuous form. The probabilistic description of the system is subsequently defined through the corresponding Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation. The closed-form stationary probability density function (PDF) of the response is obtained by solving the reduced FPK equation and using the proposed iterative method of weighted residue together with the concepts of the circulatory probability flow and the potential probability flow. Finally, the versatility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by its application to two typical examples. Note that the solution obtained by using the proposed method can be used as the benchmark to examine the accuracy of approximate solutions obtained by other methods.","Lincong Chen1, Haisheng Zhu1 & J.

Here, in a two dimensional set up we focus on ellipsoidal holes as the fine scale geometric details described by the semiaxes and their orientation. Optimization of a deterministic cost functional as well as stochastic loading with risk neutral and risk averse stochastic cost functionals are discussed. Under the assumption of linear elasticity and quadratic objective functions the computational cost scales linearly in the number of basis loads spanning the possibly large set of all realizations of the stochastic loading. The resulting shape optimization algorithm consists of a finite dimensional, constraint optimization scheme where the cost functional and its gradient are evaluated applying a boundary element method on the fine scale geometry.

0,Random mappings of scaled graphs,"Given a connected finite graph Γ with a fixed base point O and some graph G with a based point we study random 1-Lipschitz maps of a scaled Γ into G. We are mostly interested in the case where G is a Cayley graph of some finitely generated group, where the construction does not depend on the choice of base points. A particular case of Γ being a graph on two vertices and one edge corresponds to the random walk on G, and the case where Γ is a graph on two vertices and two edges joining them corresponds to Brownian bridge in G. We show, that unlike in the case \({G=\mathbb Z^d}\), the asymptotic behavior of a random scaled mapping of Γ into G may differ significantly from the asymptotic behavior of random walks or random loops in G. In particular, we show that this occurs when G is a free non-Abelian group. Also we consider the case when G is a wreath product of \({\mathbb Z}\) with a finite group. To treat this case we prove new estimates for transition probabilities in such wreath products. For any group G generated by a finite set S we define a functor E from category of finite connected graphs to the category of equivalence relations on such graphs.

0,Distances and isomorphism between networks: stability and convergence of network invariants,"We develop the theoretical foundations of a generalized Gromov–Hausdorff distance between functions on networks that has recently been applied to various subfields of topological data analysis and optimal transport. These functional representations of networks, or networks for short, specialize in the finite setting to (possibly asymmetric) adjacency matrices and derived representations such as distance or kernel matrices. Existing literature utilizing these constructions cannot, however, benefit from continuous formulations because the continuum limits of finite networks under this distance are not well-understood. For example, while there are currently numerous persistent homology methods on finite networks, it is unclear if these methods produce well-defined persistence diagrams in the infinite setting. We resolve this situation by introducing the collection of compact networks that arises by taking continuum limits of finite networks and developing sampling results showing that this collection admits well-defined persistence diagrams. The difference between the network setting and metric setting arises as follows. For metric spaces, the isomorphism class of the Gromov–Hausdorff distance consists of isometric spaces and is thus very simple. For networks, the isomorphism class is rather complex, and contains representatives having different cardinalities and different topologies. We provide an exact characterization of a suitable notion of isomorphism for compact networks as well as alternative, stronger characterizations under additional topological regularity assumptions. Toward data applications, we describe a unified framework for developing quantitatively stable network invariants, provide basic examples, and cast existing results on the stability of persistent homology methods in this extended framework. To illustrate our theoretical results, we introduce a model of directed circles with finite reversibility and characterize their Dowker persistence diagrams.

0,Ancestries of a recombining diploid population,"We derive the exact one-step transition probabilities of the number of lineages that are ancestral to a random sample from the current generation of a bi-parental population that is evolving under the discrete Wright–Fisher model with \(n\) diploid individuals. Our model allows for a per-generation recombination probability of \(r\). When \(r=1\), our model is equivalent to Chang’s (Adv Appl Probab 31:1002–1038, 1999) model for the karyotic pedigree. When \(r=0\), our model is equivalent to Kingman’s (Stoch Process Appl 13:235–248, 1982) discrete coalescent model for the cytoplasmic tree or sub-karyotic tree containing a DNA locus that is free of intra-locus recombination. When \(0 < r <1\) our model can be thought to track a sub-karyotic ancestral graph containing a DNA sequence from an autosomal chromosome that has an intra-locus recombination probability \(r\). Thus, our family of models indexed by \(r\in [0,1]\) connects Kingman’s discrete coalescent to Chang’s pedigree in a continuous way as \(r\) goes from \(0\) to \(1\). For large populations, we also study three properties of the ancestral process corresponding to a given \(r\in (0,1)\): the time \(\fancyscript{T}_n\) to a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the population, the time \(\fancyscript{U}_n\) at which all individuals are either common ancestors of all present day individuals or ancestral to none of them, and the fraction of individuals that are common ancestors at time \(\fancyscript{U}_n\). These results generalize the three main results of Chang’s (Adv Appl Probab 31:1002–1038, 1999). When we appropriately rescale time and recombination probability by the population size, our model leads to the continuous time Markov chain called the ancestral recombination graph of Hudson (Theor Popul Biol 23:183–201, 1983) and Griffiths (The two-locus ancestral graph, Institute of Mathematical Statistics 100–117, 1991).","R.

0,Staying safe and visible via message sharing in online social networks,"As an imperative channel for fast information propagation, online social networks (OSNs) also have their defects. One of them is the information leakage, i.e., information could be spread via OSNs to the users whom we are not willing to share with. Thus the problem of constructing a circle of trust to share information with as many friends as possible without further spreading it to unwanted targets has become a challenging research topic but still remained open. Our work is the first attempt to study the Maximum Circle of Trust problem seeking to share the information with the maximum expected number of poster’s friends such that the information spread to the unwanted targets is brought to its knees. First, we consider a special and more practical case with the two-hop information propagation and a single unwanted target. In this case, we show that this problem is NP-hard, which denies the existence of an exact polynomial-time algorithm. We thus propose a Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS), which can not only adjust any allowable performance error bound but also run in polynomial time with both the input size and allowed error. FPTAS is the best approximation solution one can ever wish for an NP-hard problem. We next consider the number of unwanted targets is bounded and prove that there does not exist an FPTAS in this case. Instead, we design a Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) in which the allowable error can also be controlled. When the number of unwanted targets are not bounded, we provide a randomized algorithm, along with the analytical theoretical bound and inapproximaibility result. Finally, we consider a general case with many hops information propagation and further show its #P-hardness and propose an effective Iterative Circle of Trust Detection (ICTD) algorithm based on a novel greedy function. An extensive experiment on various real-world OSNs has validated the effectiveness of our proposed approximation and ICTD algorithms. Such an extensive experiment also highlights several important observations on information leakage which help to sharpen the security of OSNs in the future.","Yilin Shen1, Thang N. Dinh1, My T.

In the classical problems, information and relative entropy are defined using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and for this reason optimal measures belong to a one-parameter exponential family. Measures within such a family have the property of mutual absolute continuity. Here we show that this property characterizes other families of optimal positive measures if a functional representing information has a strictly convex dual. Mutual absolute continuity of optimal probability measures allows us to strictly separate deterministic and non-deterministic Markov transition kernels, which play an important role in theories of decisions, estimation, control, communication and computation. We show that deterministic transitions are strictly sub-optimal, unless information resource with a strictly convex dual is unconstrained. For illustration, we construct an example where, unlike non-deterministic, any deterministic kernel either has negatively infinite expected utility (unbounded expected error) or communicates infinite information.",Roman V.

0,Diagnosis and Degradation Control for Probabilistic Systems,"Systems prone to faults are often equipped with a controller whose aim consists in restricting the behaviour of the system in order to perform a diagnosis. Such a task is called active diagnosis. However to avoid that the controller degrades the system in view of diagnosis, a second objective in terms of quality of service is usually assigned to the controller. In the framework of stochastic systems, a possible specification, called safe active diagnosis requires that the probability of correctness of the infinite (random) run is non null. We introduce and study here two alternative specifications that are in many contexts more realistic. The notion of (γ,v)-fault freeness associates with each run a value depending on the discounted length of its correct prefix where the discounting factor is γ. The controller has to ensure that the average of this value is above the threshold v. The notion of α-resiliency requires that asymptotically, at every time step, a proportion greater than α of correct runs remain correct. From a semantic point of view, we determine the equivalences and (non) implications between the three notions of degradations both for finite and infinite systems. From an algorithmic point of view, we establish the border between decidability and undecidability of the diagnosability problems. Furthermore in the positive case, we exhibit their precise complexity and propose a synthesis of the controller which may require an infinite memory.","Nathalie Bertrand

Our primary focus is a new projection method for the optimal filter infinite-dimensional stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE), based on the direct \(L^2\) metric and on a family of normal mixtures. This results in a new finite-dimensional approximate filter based on the differential geometric approach to statistics. We compare this new filter to earlier projection methods based on the Hellinger distance/Fisher metric and exponential families, and compare the \(L^2\) mixture projection filter with a particle method with the same number of parameters, using the Levy metric. We discuss differences between projecting the SPDE for the normalized density, known as Kushner–Stratonovich equation, and the SPDE for the unnormalized density known as Zakai equation. We prove that for a simple choice of the mixture manifold the \(L^2\) mixture projection filter coincides with a Galerkin method, whereas for more general mixture manifolds the equivalence does not hold and the \(L^2\) mixture filter is more general. We study particular systems that may illustrate the advantages of this new filter over other algorithms when comparing outputs with the optimal filter.

At each step in the optimization problem, improvement is based only on a relative ranking of the probabilistic merits of local design alternatives, rather than on precise quantification of the alternatives.

In this paper we illustrate an elementary application of probabilistic ordinal concepts in a 2-D optimization problem. Two uncertain variables contribute to uncertainty in the response function.

Our formulation is based on Bayesian predictive probability distributions. The criterion for founding a new taxon is given a firm theoretical foundation based on prediction and it is given a clear-cut interpretation. We formulate an algorithm for cumulative classification and apply it to a large database of bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae. The resulting taxonomy makes microbiological sense.","Mats Gyllenberg1, Timo Koski1,3, Tatu Lund1 & …Helge G.

0,A data-driven approach for a class of stochastic dynamic optimization problems,"Dynamic stochastic optimization models provide a powerful tool to represent sequential decision-making processes. Typically, these models use statistical predictive methods to capture the structure of the underlying stochastic process without taking into consideration estimation errors and model misspecification. In this context, we propose a data-driven prescriptive analytics framework aiming to integrate the machine learning and dynamic optimization machinery in a consistent and efficient way to build a bridge from data to decisions. The proposed framework tackles a relevant class of dynamic decision problems comprising many important practical applications. The basic building blocks of our proposed framework are: (1) a Hidden Markov Model as a predictive (machine learning) method to represent uncertainty; and (2) a distributionally robust dynamic optimization model as a prescriptive method that takes into account estimation errors associated with the predictive model and allows for control of the risk associated with decisions. Moreover, we present an evaluation framework to assess out-of-sample performance in rolling horizon schemes. A complete case study on dynamic asset allocation illustrates the proposed framework showing superior out-of-sample performance against selected benchmarks. The numerical results show the practical importance and applicability of the proposed framework since it extracts valuable information from data to obtain robustified decisions with an empirical certificate of out-of-sample performance evaluation.","Thuener Silva1, Davi Valladão1 & Tito Homem-de-Mello

0,"Percolation games, probabilistic cellular automata, and the hard-core model","Let each site of the square lattice \(\mathbb {Z}^2\) be independently assigned one of three states: a trap with probability p, a target with probability q, and open with probability \(1-p-q\), where \(0<p+q<1\). Consider the following game: a token starts at the origin, and two players take turns to move, where a move consists of moving the token from its current site x to either \(x+(0,1)\) or \(x+(1,0)\). A player who moves the token to a trap loses the game immediately, while a player who moves the token to a target wins the game immediately. Is there positive probability that the game is drawn with best play—i.e. that neither player can force a win? This is equivalent to the question of ergodicity of a certain family of elementary one-dimensional probabilistic cellular automata (PCA). These automata have been studied in the contexts of enumeration of directed lattice animals, the golden-mean subshift, and the hard-core model, and their ergodicity has been noted as an open problem by several authors. We prove that these PCA are ergodic, and correspondingly that the game on \(\mathbb {Z}^2\) has no draws. On the other hand, we prove that certain analogous games do exhibit draws for suitable parameter values on various directed graphs in higher dimensions, including an oriented version of the even sublattice of \(\mathbb {Z}^d\) in all \(d\ge 3\). This is proved via a dimension reduction to a hard-core lattice gas in dimension \(d-1\). We show that draws occur whenever the corresponding hard-core model has multiple Gibbs distributions. We conjecture that draws occur also on the standard oriented lattice \(\mathbb {Z}^d\) for \(d\ge 3\), but here our method encounters a fundamental obstacle.","Alexander E.

We consider the problem of identifying the clique, given a realization of such a random graph. The algorithm of Dekel et al. (ANALCO.

Spectral methods can be shown to fail on cliques smaller than \(\sqrt{N}\). In this paper we describe a nearly linear-time algorithm that succeeds with high probability for \(|\mathsf{C}_N|\ge (1+{\varepsilon })\sqrt{N/e}\) for any \({\varepsilon }>0\). This is the first algorithm that provably improves over spectral methods. We further generalize the hidden clique problem to other background graphs (the standard case corresponding to the complete graph on \(N\) vertices).

We prove lower and upper bounds of this feasible solution w.r.t. the optimal objective function value of the original problem.

neighbor
searching  problem is to build a data structure so that given a query point q , the site nearest to q  can be found quickly. This paper gives data structures for this problem when the sites and queries are in a metric space. One data structure, D(S) , uses a divide-and-conquer recursion. The other data structure, M(S,Q) , is somewhat like a skiplist. Both are simple and implementable. The data structures are analyzed when the metric space obeys a certain sphere-packing bound, and when the sites and query points are random and have distributions with an exchangeability property. This property implies, for example, that query point q  is a random element of  \( S\cup\{q\} \) . Under these conditions, the preprocessing and space bounds for the algorithms are close to linear in n . They depend also on the sphere-packing bound, and on the logarithm of the distance

In these models, a number of particles perform independent random walks on some underlying graph G. In addition, particles on the same vertex merge randomly according to a given coalescing mechanism. A remarkable property of mean-field coalescent processes is that they may come down from infinity, meaning that, starting with an infinite number of particles, only a finite number remains after any positive amount of time, almost surely. We show here however that, in the spatial setting, on any infinite and bounded-degree graph, the total number of particles will always remain infinite at all times, almost surely. Moreover, if \({G\,=\,\mathbb{Z}^d}\), and the coalescing mechanism is Kingman’s coalescent, then starting with N particles at the origin, the total number of particles remaining is of order (log* N)d at any fixed positive time (where log* is the inverse tower function). At sufficiently large times the total number of particles is of order (log* N)d-2, when d > 2. We provide parallel results in the recurrent case d = 2.

0,A mating-of-trees approach for graph distances in random planar maps,"We introduce a general technique for proving estimates for certain random planar maps which belong to the \(\gamma \)-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) universality class for \(\gamma \in (0,2)\). The family of random planar maps we consider are those which can be encoded by a two-dimensional random walk with i.i.d. increments via a mating-of-trees bijection, and includes the uniform infinite planar triangulation (UIPT; \(\gamma =\sqrt{8/3}\)); and planar maps weighted by the number of different spanning trees (\(\gamma =\sqrt{2}\)), bipolar orientations (\(\gamma =\sqrt{4/3}\)), or Schnyder woods (\(\gamma =1\)) that can be put on the map. Using our technique, we prove estimates for graph distances in the above family of random planar maps. In particular, we obtain non-trivial upper and lower bounds for the cardinality of a graph distance ball consistent with the Watabiki (Prog Theor Phys Suppl 114:1–17, 1993) prediction for the Hausdorff dimension of \(\gamma \)-LQG and we establish the existence of an exponent for certain distances in the map. The basic idea of our approach is to compare a given random planar map M to a mated-CRT map—a random planar map constructed from a correlated two-dimensional Brownian motion—using a strong coupling (Zaitsev in ESAIM Probab Stat 2:41–108, 1998) of the encoding walk for M and the Brownian motion used to construct the mated-CRT map. This allows us to deduce estimates for graph distances in M from the estimates for graph distances in the mated-CRT map which we proved (using continuum theory) in a previous work. In the special case when \(\gamma =\sqrt{8/3}\), we instead deduce estimates for the \(\sqrt{8/3}\)-mated-CRT map from known results for the UIPT.

In particular, if q=a/n and q′=b/n, s=(a−b)/2 and d=(a+b)/2, then Decelle et al. conjectured that it is possible to efficiently cluster in a way correlated with the true partition if s2>d and impossible if s2<d. By comparison, until recently the best-known rigorous result showed that clustering is possible if s2>Cdlnd for sufficiently large C.In a previous work, we proved that indeed it is information theoretically impossible to cluster if s2 ≤ d and moreover that it is information theoretically impossible to even estimate the model parameters from the graph when s2 < d. Here we prove the rest of the conjecture by providing an efficient algorithm for clustering in a way that is correlated with the true partition when s2>d.

0,Probabilistic Argumentation: An Equational Approach,"There is a generic way to add any new feature to a system. It involves (1) identifying the basic units which build up the system and (2) introducing the new feature to each of these basic units. In the case where the system is argumentation and the feature is probabilistic we have the following. The basic units are: (a) the nature of the arguments involved; (b) the membership relation in the set S of arguments; (c) the attack relation; and (d) the choice of extensions. Generically to add a new aspect (probabilistic, or fuzzy, or temporal, etc) to an argumentation network \({\langle S,R \rangle}\) can be done by adding this feature to each component (a–d). This is a brute-force method and may yield a non-intuitive or meaningful result. A better way is to meaningfully translate the object system into another target system which does have the aspect required and then let the target system endow the aspect on the initial system. In our case we translate argumentation into classical propositional logic and get probabilistic argumentation from the translation. Of course what we get depends on how we translate. In fact, in this paper we introduce probabilistic semantics to abstract argumentation theory based on the equational approach to argumentation networks. We then compare our semantics with existing proposals in the literature including the approaches by M. Thimm and by A. Hunter. Our methodology in general is discussed in the conclusion.","D. M.

The piecewise functions are obtained from the dual solutions of the optimization problem at each stage and correspond to Benders cuts in a stochastic, multistage decomposition framework.

0,Sharp Poincaré and log-Sobolev inequalities for the switch chain on regular bipartite graphs,"Consider the switch chain on the set of d-regular bipartite graphs on n vertices with \(3\le d\le n^{c}\), for a small universal constant \(c>0\). We prove that the chain satisfies a Poincaré inequality with a constant of order O(nd); moreover, when d is fixed, we establish a log-Sobolev inequality for the chain with a constant of order \(O_d(n\log n)\). We show that both results are optimal. The Poincaré inequality implies that in the regime \(3\le d\le n^c\) the mixing time of the switch chain is at most \(O\big ((nd)^2 \log (nd)\big )\), improving on the previously known bound \(O\big ((nd)^{13} \log (nd)\big )\) due to Kannan et al. (Rand Struct Algorithm 14(4):293–308, 1999) and \(O\big (n^7d^{18} \log (nd)\big )\) obtained by Dyer et al. (Sampling hypergraphs with given degrees (preprint). arXiv:2006.12021 ). The log-Sobolev inequality that we establish for constant d implies a bound \(O(n\log ^2 n)\) on the mixing time of the chain which, up to the \(\log n\) factor, captures a conjectured optimal bound. Our proof strategy relies on building, for any fixed function on the set of d-regular bipartite simple graphs, an appropriate extension to a function on the set of multigraphs given by the configuration model. We then establish a comparison procedure with the well studied random transposition model in order to obtain the corresponding functional inequalities. While our method falls into a rich class of comparison techniques for Markov chains on different state spaces, the crucial feature of the method—dealing with chains with a large distortion between their stationary measures—is a novel addition to the theory.

0,Hybrid master equation for jump-diffusion approximation of biomolecular reaction networks,"Cellular reactions have a multi-scale nature in the sense that the abundance of molecular species and the magnitude of reaction rates can vary across orders of magnitude. This diversity naturally leads to hybrid models that combine continuous and discrete modeling regimes. In order to capture this multi-scale nature, we proposed jump-diffusion approximations in a previous study. The key idea was to partition reactions into fast and slow groups, and then to combine a Markov jump updating scheme for the slow group with a diffusion (Langevin) updating scheme for the fast group. In this study we show that the joint probability density function of the jump-diffusion approximation over the reaction counting process satisfies a hybrid master equation that combines terms from the chemical master equation and from the Fokker–Planck equation. Inspired by the method of conditional moments, we propose a efficient method to solve this master equation using the moments of reaction counters of the fast reactions given the reaction counters of the slow reactions. For each time point of interest, we then solve a set of maximum entropy problems in order to recover the conditional probability density from its moments. This finally allows us to reconstruct the complete joint probability density over all reaction counters and hence obtain an approximate solution of the hybrid master equation. Finally, we show the accuracy of the method applied to a simple multi-scale conversion process.","Derya Altıntan

We further explore run time distributions and describe a new tool to compare two algorithms based on stochastic local search. For the case where the running times of both algorithms fit exponential distributions, we derive a closed form index that gives the probability that one of them finds a solution at least as good as a given target value in a smaller computation time than the other. This result is extended to the case of general run time distributions and a numerical iterative procedure is described for the computation of the above probability value.

We ask whether an infinite path π exists, with the property that the partial sums of the ±1s along π are uniformly bounded, and whether there exists an infinite path π' with the property that the partial sums along π' are equal to zero infinitely often. The answers to these question depend on the type of path one allows, the value of p and the uniform bound specified. We show that phase transitions occur for these phenomena. Moreover, we make a surprising connection between the problem of finding a path to infinity (not necessarily self-avoiding, but visiting each vertex at most finitely many times) with a given bound on the partial sums, and the classical Boolean model with squares around the points of a Poisson process in the plane.

This problem is modeled as continuous time Markov decision process. For this assignment problem performance optimization is in general considered to be difficult. Moreover, for optimal dynamic Markov decision policies the corresponding decision rules have in general a complicated structure not facilitating a smooth implementation. On the other hand optimization over the subclass of so-called static policies is known to be tractable. In the current paper a suitable static decision rule is mixed with dynamic decision rules which are selected such that these rules are relatively easy to describe and implement. Some mixing methods are discussed and optimization is performed over corresponding classes of so-called mixing policies. These mixing policies maintain the property that they are easy to describe and implement compared to overall optimal dynamic Markov decision policies. Besides for all investigated instances the optimized mixing policies perform substantially better than optimal static policies.","Dinard van der Laan

In the same way, the rectangular free convolution \(\boxplus_{\lambda}\) allows to deduce, from the individual singular distributions, the singular distribution of a sum of independent unitarily invariant rectangular random matrices. In this paper, we consider the regularization properties of these free convolutions on the whole real line. More specifically, we try to find continuous semigroups (μ
t
) of probability measures such that μ0 = δ0 and such that for all t > 0 and all probability measure \(\nu, \mu_t\boxplus\nu\) (or, in the rectangular context, \(\mu_t\boxplus_{\lambda}\nu\)) is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, with a positive analytic density on the whole real line. In the square case, for \(\boxplus\), we prove that in semigroups satisfying this property, no measure can have a finite second moment, and we give a sufficient condition on semigroups to satisfy this property, with examples. In the rectangular case, we prove that in most cases, for μ in a \(\boxplus_{\lambda}\)-continuous semigroup, \(\mu\boxplus_{\lambda}\nu\) either has an atom at the origin or doesn’t put any mass in a neighborhood of the origin, and thus the expected property does not hold.

1/p
2 according to data from two independent samples is considered. Each sample may be obtained in the framework of direct or inverse binomial sampling. Asymptotic confidence intervals are constructed in accordance with different types of sampling schemes with an application, where it is possible, of unbiased estimations of success probabilities and also their logarithms. Since methods of constructing confidence intervals in the situations when values for the both samples are obtained for identical sample schemes (for only direct or only inverse binomial sampling) are already developed and well known, the main purpose of this paper is the investigation of constructing confidence intervals in two cases that correspond to different sampling schemes (one is direct, another is inverse). In this situation it is possible to plan the sample size for the second sample according to the number of successes in the first sample. This, as it is shown by the results of statistical modeling, provides the intervals with confidence level which closer to the nominal value. Our goal is to show that the normal approximations (which are relatively simple) for estimates of p
1/p
2 and their logarithms are reliable for a construction of confidence intervals. The main criterion of our judgment is the closeness of the confidence coefficient to the nominal confidence level. It is proved theoretically and shown by statistically modeled data that the scheme of inverse binomial sampling with planning of the size in the second sample is preferred. Main probability characteristics of intervals corresponding to all possible combinations of sampling schemes are investigated by the Monte-Carlo method. Estimations of coverage probability, expectation and standard deviation of interval widths are collected in tables and some recommendations for an application of each of the intervals obtained are presented.

0,Inclusive Fitness from Multitype Branching Processes,"I use multitype branching processes to study genetic models for the evolution of social behaviour, i.e. behaviours that, when acted out, affect the success of the actor’s neighbours. Here, I suppose an individual bearing a mutant copy of a gene influences the reproductive success of a neighbour by altering its own competitive ability. Approximations based on assumptions about the rareness of the mutant allele and the strength of selection allow me to formulate statements concerning the probability of mutant extinction in terms of inclusive fitness. Inclusive fitness is an idea well known to biologists and can be thought of as a sum of an individual’s fitness and the fitness of each of its relatives, weighted by some measure of genetic relatedness. Previous work has led to some confusion surrounding the definition of the inclusive-fitness effect of a mutant allele when individuals carrying that allele experience demographic conditions that fluctuate randomly.

0,On the expectation of a persistence diagram by the persistence weighted kernel,"In topological data analysis, persistent homology characterizes robust topological features in data and it has a summary representation, called a persistence diagram. Statistical research for persistence diagrams have been actively developed, and the persistence weighted kernel shows several advantages over other statistical methods for persistence diagrams. If data is drawn from some probability distribution, the corresponding persistence diagram have randomness. Then, the expectation of the persistence diagram by the persistence weighted kernel is well-defined. In this paper, we study relationships between a probability distribution and the persistence weighted kernel in the viewpoint of (1) the strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem, (2) a confidence interval to estimate the expectation of the persistence weighted kernel numerically, and (3) the stability theorem to ensure the continuity of the map from a probability distribution to the expectation. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate our method gives an interesting counterexample to a common view in topological data analysis.","Genki Kusano

0,A three-term recurrence relation for accurate evaluation of transition probabilities of the simple birth-and-death process,"The simple (linear) birth-and-death process is a widely used stochastic model for describing the dynamics of a population. When the process is observed discretely over time, despite the large amount of literature on the subject, little is known about formal estimator properties. Here we will show that its application to observed data is further complicated by the fact that numerical evaluation of the well-known transition probability is an ill-conditioned problem. To overcome this difficulty we will rewrite the transition probability in terms of a Gaussian hypergeometric function and subsequently obtain a three-term recurrence relation for its accurate evaluation. We will also study the properties of the hypergeometric function as a solution to the three-term recurrence relation. We will then provide formulas for the gradient and Hessian of the log-likelihood function and conclude the article by applying our methods for numerically computing maximum likelihood estimates in both simulated and real dataset.","Alberto Pessia

Based on a schematic recombination process, we describe two simple Markov models for sequences evolving on pedigrees—Model R (recombinations without mutations) and Model RM (recombinations with mutations). For these models, we ask an identifiability question: is it possible to construct a pedigree from the joint probability distribution of extant sequences? We present partial identifiability results for general pedigrees: we show that when the crossover probabilities are sufficiently small, certain spanning subgraph sequences can be counted from the joint distribution of extant sequences. We demonstrate how pedigrees that earlier seemed difficult to distinguish are distinguished by counting their spanning subgraph sequences.",Bhalchandra D.

0,Pathwise description of dynamic pitchfork bifurcations with additive noise," The slow drift (with speed ɛ) of a parameter through a pitchfork bifurcation point, known as the dynamic pitchfork bifurcation, is characterized by a significant delay of the transition from the unstable to the stable state. We describe the effect of an additive noise, of intensity σ, by giving precise estimates on the behaviour of the individual paths. We show that until time  after the bifurcation, the paths are concentrated in a region of size  around the bifurcating equilibrium. With high probability, they leave a neighbourhood of this equilibrium during a time interval , after which they are likely to stay close to the corresponding deterministic solution. We derive exponentially small upper bounds for the probability of the sets of exceptional paths, with explicit values for the exponents.

0,A branching process for the early spread of a transposable element in a diploid population,"Transposable elements (TEs) face significant challenges upon transfer into a new host population, invariably beginning their invasion with only a single element. The fate of this element is a product of its internal properties, the population dynamics of the host species, and genetic drift. We present a continuous-time multi-type branching process to model the early stages of TE spread. The model incorporates seasonal population size changes and is applicable to diploid hosts for prevalences up to 10%. We reproduce standard results of TE population dynamics and show that population growth may have a greater influence on reducing TE loss probability than a transpositional burst. These results are applied to the planned use of a TE to drive an antimalarial gene into an Anopheles gambiae population. The model favors a transgenic release immediately following the dry season when the An. gambiae population begins to grow. Increasing the number of transgenic hosts released has the greatest influence on reducing the probability of TE loss. Following release, the rate at which the TE increases its proportion in the population is most sensitive to its replicative transposition rate. The model recommends a replicative transposition rate greater than 0.1 per TE per generation to satisfy public health goals.",John M.

Credal networks extend Bayesian nets to sets of distributions, or credal sets. This paper extends a state-of-the-art Bayesian net for classification, called tree-augmented naive Bayes classifier, to credal sets originated from probability intervals. This extension is a basis to address the fundamental problem of prior ignorance about the distribution that generates the data, which is a commonplace in data mining applications. This issue is often neglected, but addressing it properly is a key to ultimately draw reliable conclusions from the inferred models. In this paper we formalize the new model, develop an exact linear-time classification algorithm, and evaluate the credal net-based classifier on a number of real data sets. The empirical analysis shows that the new classifier is good and reliable, and raises a problem of excessive caution that is discussed in the paper. Overall, given the favorable trade-off between expressiveness and efficient computation, the newly proposed classifier appears to be a good candidate for the wide-scale application of reliable classifiers based on credal networks, to real and complex tasks.",Marco Zaffalon1 & Enrico Fagiuoli,Reliable Computing,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1025822321743,"Data Mining,Bayesian Network,Classification Algorithm,Reliable Conclusion,Mining Task"

0,"Amenability, connected components, and definable actions","We study amenability of definable groups and topological groups, and prove various results, briefly described below. Among our main technical tools, of interest in its own right, is an elaboration on and strengthening of the Massicot-Wagner version (Massicot and Wagner in J Ec Polytech Math 2:55–63, 2015) of the stabilizer theorem (Hrushovski in J Am Math Soc 25:189–243, 2012), and also some results about measures and measure-like functions (which we call means and pre-means). As an application we show that if G is an amenable topological group, then the Bohr compactification of G coincides with a certain “weak Bohr compactification” introduced in Krupiński and Pillay (Adv Math 345:1253–1299, 2019). In other words, the conclusion says that certain connected components of G coincide: \(G^{00}_{{{\,\mathrm{{top}}\,}}} = G^{000}_{{{\,\mathrm{{top}}\,}}}\). We also prove wide generalizations of this result, implying in particular its extension to a “definable-topological” context, confirming the main conjectures from Krupiński and Pillay (2019). We also introduce \(\bigvee \)-definable group topologies on a given \(\emptyset \)-definable group G (including group topologies induced by type-definable subgroups as well as uniformly definable group topologies), and prove that the existence of a mean on the lattice of closed, type-definable subsets of G implies (under some assumption) that \({{\,\mathrm{{cl}}\,}}(G^{00}_M) = {{\,\mathrm{{cl}}\,}}(G^{000}_M)\) for any model M. Secondly, we study the relationship between (separate) definability of an action of a definable group on a compact space [in the sense of Gismatullin et al. (Ann Pure Appl Log 165:552–562, 2014)], weakly almost periodic (wap) actions of G [in the sense of Ellis and Nerurkar (Trans Am Math Soc 313:103–119, 1989)], and stability. We conclude that any group G definable in a sufficiently saturated structure is “weakly definably amenable” in the sense of Krupiński and Pillay (2019), namely any definable action of G on a compact space supports a G-invariant probability measure. This gives negative solutions to some questions and conjectures raised in Krupiński (J Symb Log 82:1080–1105, 2017) and Krupiński and Pillay (2019). Stability in continuous logic will play a role in some proofs in this part of the paper. Thirdly, we give an example of a \(\emptyset \)-definable approximate subgroup X in a saturated extension of the group \({{\mathbb {F}}}_2 \times {{\mathbb {Z}}}\) in a suitable language (where \({{\mathbb {F}}}_2\) is the free group in 2-generators) for which the \(\bigvee \)-definable group \(H:=\langle X \rangle \) contains no type-definable subgroup of bounded index. This refutes a conjecture by Wagner and shows that the Massicot-Wagner approach to prove that a locally compact (and in consequence also Lie) “model” exists for each approximate subgroup does not work in general (they proved in (Massicot and Wagner 2015) that it works for definably amenable approximate subgroups).

0,Euclidean Distance Between Haar Orthogonal and Gaussian Matrices,"In this work, we study a version of the general question of how well a Haar-distributed orthogonal matrix can be approximated by a random Gaussian matrix. Here, we consider a Gaussian random matrix \(Y_n\) of order n and apply to it the Gram–Schmidt orthonormalization procedure by columns to obtain a Haar-distributed orthogonal matrix \(U_n\). If \(F_i^m\) denotes the vector formed by the first m-coordinates of the ith row of \(Y_n-\sqrt{n}U_n\) and \(\alpha \,=\,\frac{m}{n}\), our main result shows that the Euclidean norm of \(F_i^m\) converges exponentially fast to \(\sqrt{ \big (2-\frac{4}{3} \frac{(1-(1 -\alpha )^{3/2})}{\alpha }\big )m}\), up to negligible terms. To show the extent of this result, we use it to study the convergence of the supremum norm \(\epsilon _n(m)\,=\,\sup _{1\le i \le n, 1\le j \le m} |y_{i,j}- \sqrt{n}u_{i,j}|\) and we find a coupling that improves by a factor \(\sqrt{2}\) the recently proved best known upper bound on \(\epsilon _n(m)\).

In this paper, we propose a game where agents’ strategic sets consist of all possible sharing securities and pricing kernels that are consistent with Arrow–Debreu sharing rules. First, it is shown that agents’ best response problems have unique solutions. The risk-sharing Nash equilibrium admits a finite-dimensional characterisation, and it is proved to exist for an arbitrary number of agents and to be unique in the two-agent game. In equilibrium, agents declare beliefs on future random outcomes different from their actual probability assessments, and the risk-sharing securities are endogenously bounded, implying (among other things) loss of efficiency. In addition, an analysis regarding extremely risk-tolerant agents indicates that they profit more from the Nash risk-sharing equilibrium than compared to the Arrow–Debreu one.",Michail Anthropelos1 & Constantinos Kardaras,Finance and Stochastics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-017-0323-9,"Nash equilibrium,Risk sharing,Heterogeneous beliefs,Reporting of beliefs"

0,Probabilistic Gompertz model of irreversible growth,"Characterizing organism growth within populations requires the application of well-studied individual size-at-age models, such as the deterministic Gompertz model, to populations of individuals whose characteristics, corresponding to model parameters, may be highly variable. A natural approach is to assign probability distributions to one or more model parameters. In some contexts, size-at-age data may be absent due to difficulties in ageing individuals, but size-increment data may instead be available (e.g., from tag-recapture experiments). A preliminary transformation to a size-increment model is then required. Gompertz models developed along the above lines have recently been applied to strongly heterogeneous abalone tag-recapture data. Although useful in modelling the early growth stages, these models yield size-increment distributions that allow negative growth, which is inappropriate in the case of mollusc shells and other accumulated biological structures (e.g., vertebrae) where growth is irreversible.Here we develop probabilistic Gompertz models where this difficulty is resolved by conditioning parameter distributions on size, allowing application to irreversible growth data. In the case of abalone growth, introduction of a growth-limiting biological length scale is then shown to yield realistic length-increment distributions.",D. C.

This type of discounting nicely models human behaviour, which is time-inconsistent in the long run. The decision maker has preferences changing in time. Therefore, the standard approach based on the Bellman optimality principle fails. Within a dynamic game-theoretic framework, we prove the existence of randomised stationary Markov perfect equilibria for a large class of Markov decision processes with transitions having a density function. We also show that randomisation can be restricted to two actions in every state of the process. Moreover, we prove that under some conditions, this equilibrium can be replaced by a deterministic one. For models with countable state spaces, we establish the existence of deterministic Markov perfect equilibria. Many examples are given to illustrate our results, including a portfolio selection model with quasi-hyperbolic discounting.","Anna Jaśkiewicz

0,Automatic liver and tumor segmentation based on deep learning and globally optimized refinement,"Automatic segmentation of the liver and hepatic lesions from abdominal 3D computed tomography (CT) images is fundamental tasks in computer-assisted liver surgery planning. However, due to complex backgrounds, ambiguous boundaries, heterogeneous appearances and highly varied shapes of the liver, accurate liver segmentation and tumor detection are still challenging problems. To address these difficulties, we propose an automatic segmentation framework based on 3D U-net with dense connections and globally optimized refinement. Firstly, a deep U-net architecture with dense connections is trained to learn the probability map of the liver. Then the probability map goes into the following refinement step as the initial surface and prior shape. The segmentation of liver tumor is based on the similar network architecture with the help of segmentation results of liver. In order to reduce the influence of the surrounding tissues with the similar intensity and texture behavior with the tumor region, during the training procedure, I × liverlabel is the input of the network for the segmentation of liver tumor. By doing this, the accuracy of segmentation can be improved. The proposed method is fully automatic without any user interaction. Both qualitative and quantitative results reveal that the proposed approach is efficient and accurate for liver volume estimation in clinical application. The high correlation between the automatic and manual references shows that the proposed method can be good enough to replace the time-consuming and non-reproducible manual segmentation method.","Yuan Hong1, Xiong-wei Mao2,3 na1, Qing-lei Hui1, Xiao-ping Ouyang4, Zhi-yi Peng2 & …De-xing Kong",Applied Mathematics-A Journal of Chinese Universities,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11766-021-4376-3,"liver segmentation,tumor segmentation,CT,deep learning"

0,Steepest Descent Method with Random Step Lengths,"The paper studies the steepest descent method applied to the minimization of a twice continuously differentiable function. Under certain conditions, the random choice of the step length parameter, independent of the actual iteration, generates a process that is almost surely R-convergent for quadratic functions. The convergence properties of this random procedure are characterized based on the mean value function related to the distribution of the step length parameter. The distribution of the random step length, which guarantees the maximum asymptotic convergence rate independent of the detailed properties of the Hessian matrix of the minimized function, is found, and its uniqueness is proved. The asymptotic convergence rate of this optimally created random procedure is equal to the convergence rate of the Chebyshev polynomials method. Under practical conditions, the efficiency of the suggested random steepest descent method is degraded by numeric noise, particularly for ill-conditioned problems; furthermore, the asymptotic convergence rate is not achieved due to the finiteness of the realized calculations. The suggested random procedure is also applied to the minimization of a general non-quadratic function. An algorithm needed to estimate relevant bounds for the Hessian matrix spectrum is created. In certain cases, the random procedure may surpass the conjugate gradient method. Interesting results are achieved when minimizing functions having a large number of local minima.

In this paper, we study the optimal control of such an epidemic through immunization of susceptibles when costs are proportional to the area under the infectives trajectory plus the total number of immunizations. When the immunization rate is bounded, optimal controls are of bang-bang type and are characterized by switching curves in the epidemic state space. Explicit expressions for these curves are obtained in the case of deterministic dynamics. When the epidemic is described by a Markov chain, numerical solutions for the switching curve are easy to obtain by dynamic programming, and useful analytic approximations to them are described. The results include those for the so-called general epidemic in which no recovery is allowed.",K.

0,Global linear convergence of evolution strategies with recombination on scaling-invariant functions,"Evolution Strategies (ESs) are stochastic derivative-free optimization algorithms whose most prominent representative, the CMA-ES algorithm, is widely used to solve difficult numerical optimization problems. We provide the first rigorous investigation of the linear convergence of step-size adaptive ESs involving a population and recombination, two ingredients crucially important in practice to be robust to local irregularities or multimodality. We investigate the convergence of step-size adaptive ESs with weighted recombination on composites of strictly increasing functions with continuously differentiable scaling-invariant functions with a global optimum. This function class includes functions with non-convex sublevel sets and discontinuous functions. We prove the existence of a constant r such that the logarithm of the distance to the optimum divided by the number of iterations converges to r. The constant is given as an expectation with respect to the stationary distribution of a Markov chain—its sign allows to infer linear convergence or divergence of the ES and is found numerically. Our main condition for convergence is the increase of the expected log step-size on linear functions. In contrast to previous results, our condition is equivalent to the almost sure geometric divergence of the step-size on linear functions.","Cheikh Toure1, Anne Auger1 & Nikolaus Hansen",Journal of Global Optimization,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-022-01249-6,"Evolution strategies,Linear convergence,CMA-ES,Scaling-invariant functions,Foster–Lyapunov drift conditions"
0,Pure Random Search with Virtual Extension of Feasible Region,"We propose a modification of the pure random search algorithm for cases when the global optimum point can be located near the boundary of a feasible region. If the feasible region is cube-shaped, the worst case occurs when the global optimum point is located at the vertex of a cube. In these cases, the sample size for the pure random search should be increased significantly because the success probability of the single trial is decreased. The proposed modification is based on the virtual extension of the feasible region. The extended region contains \(\varepsilon \)-neighbourhoods of all points of the original region. All random points that fall outside the original feasible region are mapped to the nearest points on its boundary before the values of an objective function at these points are calculated. This extension of the feasible region also leads to an increase in the sample size due to the increased volume. We compare sample sizes required to hit into the neighbourhood of the global optimum point with a given probability for the proposed method and the original pure random search algorithm with a corrected sample size. We consider ball-shaped and cube-shaped feasible regions and find the sufficient conditions for the proposed algorithm to be more efficient. We offer a practical recommendation for cases, in which the feasible region is defined by a system of linear inequalities.","E. A. Tsvetkov

0,A Model for Genome Size Evolution,"We present a model for genome size evolution that takes into account both local mutations such as small insertions and small deletions, and large chromosomal rearrangements such as duplications and large deletions. We introduce the possibility of undergoing several mutations within one generation. The model, albeit minimalist, reveals a non-trivial spontaneous dynamics of genome size: in the absence of selection, an arbitrary large part of genomes remains beneath a finite size, even for a duplication rate 2.6-fold higher than the rate of large deletions, and even if there is also a systematic bias toward small insertions compared to small deletions. Specifically, we show that the condition of existence of an asymptotic stationary distribution for genome size non-trivially depends on the rates and mean sizes of the different mutation types. We also give upper bounds for the median and other quantiles of the genome size distribution, and argue that these bounds cannot be overcome by selection. Taken together, our results show that the spontaneous dynamics of genome size naturally prevents it from growing infinitely, even in cases where intuition would suggest an infinite growth. Using quantitative numerical examples, we show that, in practice, a shrinkage bias appears very quickly in genomes undergoing mutation accumulation, even though DNA gains and losses appear to be perfectly symmetrical at first sight. We discuss this spontaneous dynamics in the light of the other evolutionary forces proposed in the literature and argue that it provides them a stability-related size limit below which they can act.","Stephan Fischer1, Samuel Bernard2, Guillaume Beslon1 & …Carole Knibbe",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-014-9997-8,"Genome size,Molecular evolution,Chromosomal rearrangements,Markov chain,Doeblin’s condition"
0,Performance analysis and optimization of cognitive radio networks with retransmission control,"In usual cognitive radio networks with buffer settings, secondary user packets that are interrupted by primary user packets will return to the SU buffer for later retransmission. But this may increase the average delay of the SU packets. In this paper, we propose a novel spectrum sharing strategy (SSS) to dynamically control the retransmission of the SU packets by introducing a returning threshold and a returning probability. This will simultaneously guarantee the Quality of Service for the SUs. In this SSS, when the transmission of an SU packet is interrupted, if the number of SU packets already in SU buffer reaches a returning threshold that is set in advance as a system parameter, an interrupted SU packet is admitted to return to the SU buffer with a dynamic returning probability. This returning probability is inversely proportional to the total number of packets in the system. Based on the SSS with retransmission control proposed in this paper, we build a discrete-time preemptive priority queueing model to comply with digital nature of modern networks. Accordingly, by presenting and analyzing a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain that represents the system state transition, we obtain the steady-state distribution of the system and then provide the formulas for several system performance measures. Moreover, with numerical results, we show the influence of the returning threshold on different performance measures. Finally, by building a net benefit function, we optimize the system performance for the returning threshold to balance different system performance measures.",Yuan Zhao1 & Wuyi Yue,Optimization Letters,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11590-017-1119-8,"Cognitive radio networks,Retransmission control,Returning threshold,Returning probability,Performance analysis,System optimization"
0,An epidemic model integrating direct and fomite transmission as well as household structure applied to COVID-19,"This paper stresses its base contribution on a new SIR-type model including direct and fomite transmission as well as the effect of distinct household structures. The model derivation is modulated by several mechanistic processes inherent from typical airborne diseases. The notion of minimum contact radius is included in the direct transmission, facilitating the arguments on physical distancing. As fomite transmission heavily relates to former-trace of sneezes, the vector field of the system naturally contains an integral kernel with time delay indicating the contribution of undetected and non-quarantined asymptomatic cases in accumulating the historical contamination of surfaces. We then increase the complexity by including the different transmission routines within and between households. For airborne diseases, within-household interactions play a significant role in the propagation of the disease rendering countrywide effect. Two steps were taken to include the effect of household structure. The first step subdivides the entire compartments (susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, symptomatic, recovered, death) into the household level and different infection rates for the direct transmission within and between households were distinguished. Under predefined conditions and assumptions, the governing system on household level can be raised to the community level. The second step then raises the governing system to the country level, where the final state variables estimate the total individuals from all compartments in the country. Two key attributes related to the household structure (number of local households and number of household members) effectively classify countries to be of low or high risk in terms of effective disease propagation. The basic reproductive number is calculated and its biological meaning is invoked properly. The numerical methods for solving the DIDE-system and the parameter estimation problem were mentioned. Our optimal model solutions are in quite good agreement with datasets of COVID-19 active cases and related deaths from Germany and Sri Lanka in early infection, allowing us to hypothesize several unobservable situations in the two countries. Focusing on extending minimum contact radius and reducing the intensity of individual activities, we were able to synthesize the key parameters telling what to practice.","Karunia Putra Wijaya1, Naleen Ganegoda2, Yashika Jayathunga1, Thomas Götz1, Moritz Schäfer1 & …Peter Heidrich",Journal of Mathematics in Industry,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13362-020-00097-x,"Mathematical model,Direct transmission,Fomite transmission,COVID-19,Parameter estimation"

0,A provably convergent heuristic for stochastic bicriteria integer programming,"We propose a general-purpose algorithm APS (Adaptive Pareto-Sampling) for determining the set of Pareto-optimal solutions of bicriteria combinatorial optimization (CO) problems under uncertainty, where the objective functions are expectations of random variables depending on a decision from a finite feasible set. APS is iterative and population-based and combines random sampling with the solution of corresponding deterministic bicriteria CO problem instances. Special attention is given to the case where the corresponding deterministic bicriteria CO problem can be formulated as a bicriteria integer linear program (ILP). In this case, well-known solution techniques such as the algorithm by Chalmet et al. can be applied for solving the deterministic subproblem. If the execution of APS is terminated after a given number of iterations, only an approximate solution is obtained in general, such that APS must be considered a metaheuristic. Nevertheless, a strict mathematical result is shown that ensures, under rather mild conditions, convergence of the current solution set to the set of Pareto-optimal solutions. A modification replacing or supporting the bicriteria ILP solver by some metaheuristic for multicriteria CO problems is discussed. As an illustration, we outline the application of the method to stochastic bicriteria knapsack problems by specializing the general framework to this particular case and by providing computational examples.",Walter J.

The transition FPK equation of vibratory energy harvesting systems is a four-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equation. Therefore, it is often very challenging to obtain an exact probability density. This paper aims to investigate the stochastic response of vibration energy harvesters (VEHs) under the Gaussian white noise excitation. The numerical path integration method is applied to different types of nonlinear VEHs. The probability density function (PDF) from the transition FPK equation of energy harvesting systems is calculated using the path integration method. The path integration process is introduced by using the Gauss-Legendre integration scheme, and the short-time transition PDF is formulated with the short-time Gaussian approximation. The stationary probability densities of the transition FPK equation for vibratory energy harvesters are determined.

The distribution functions of these statistics are approximated by an Edgeworth expansion with a remainder of order \(o(N^{-1})\). The Edgeworth expansion is based on Hoeffding’s decomposition which provides a stochastic expansion into a linear part, a quadratic part as well as smaller higher order parts. The validity of this Edgeworth expansion is proved under Cramér’s condition on the linear part, moment assumptions for all parts of the statistic and an optimal dimensionality requirement for the non linear part.

0,A Unified Approach to Uniform Signal Recovery From Nonlinear Observations,"Recent advances in quantized compressed sensing and high-dimensional estimation have shown that signal recovery is even feasible under strong nonlinear distortions in the observation process. An important characteristic of associated guarantees is uniformity, i.e., recovery succeeds for an entire class of structured signals with a fixed measurement ensemble. However, despite significant results in various special cases, a general understanding of uniform recovery from nonlinear observations is still missing. This paper develops a unified approach to this problem under the assumption of i.i.d. sub-Gaussian measurement vectors. Our main result shows that a simple least-squares estimator with any convex constraint can serve as a universal recovery strategy, which is outlier robust and does not require explicit knowledge of the underlying nonlinearity. Based on empirical process theory, a key technical novelty is an approximative increment condition that can be implemented for all common types of nonlinear models. This flexibility allows us to apply our approach to a variety of problems in nonlinear compressed sensing and high-dimensional statistics, leading to several new and improved guarantees. Each of these applications is accompanied by a conceptually simple and systematic proof, which does not rely on any deeper properties of the observation model. On the other hand, known local stability properties can be incorporated into our framework in a plug-and-play manner, thereby implying near-optimal error bounds.",Martin Genzel1 & Alexander Stollenwerk,Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-022-09562-y,"Uniform recovery,High-dimensional estimation,Nonlinear observations,Quantized compressed sensing,Empirical processes"
0,"Decomposing Arrangements of Hyperplanes: VC-Dimension, Combinatorial Dimension, and Point Location","This work is motivated by several basic problems and techniques that rely on space decomposition of arrangements of hyperplanes in high-dimensional spaces, most notably Meiser’s 1993 algorithm (Meiser in Inf Comput 106(2):286–303, 1993) for point location in such arrangements. A standard approach to these problems is via random sampling, in which one draws a random sample of the hyperplanes, constructs a suitable decomposition of its arrangement, and recurses within each cell of the decomposition with the subset of hyperplanes that cross the cell. The efficiency of the resulting algorithm depends on the quality of the sample, which is controlled by various parameters. One of these parameters is the classical VC-dimension, and its associated primal shatter dimension, of a suitably defined corresponding range space. Another parameter, which we refer to here as the combinatorial dimension, is the maximum number of hyperplanes that are needed to define a cell that can arise in the decomposition of some sample of the input hyperplanes; this parameter arises in Clarkson’s (and later Clarkson and Shor’s) random sampling technique. We re-examine these parameters for the two main space decomposition techniques—bottom-vertex triangulation, and vertical decomposition, including their explicit dependence on the dimension d, and discover several unexpected phenomena, which show that, in both techniques, there are large gaps between the VC-dimension (and primal shatter dimension), and the combinatorial dimension. Our main application is to point location in an arrangement of n hyperplanes is \(\mathbb {R}^d\), in which we show that the query cost in Meiser’s algorithm can be improved if one uses vertical decomposition instead of bottom-vertex triangulation, at the cost of some increase in the preprocessing cost and storage (which seem to be stated incorrectly, and are not worked out, in Meiser’s work). Our improved bounds rely on establishing several new structural properties and improved complexity bounds for vertical decomposition, which are of independent interest, and which we expect to find additional applications.","Esther Ezra

0,On the Convergence of Adaptive Stochastic Search Methods for Constrained and Multi-objective Black-Box Optimization,"Stochastic search methods for global optimization and multi-objective optimization are widely used in practice, especially on problems with black-box objective and constraint functions. Although there are many theoretical results on the convergence of stochastic search methods, relatively few deal with black-box constraints and multiple black-box objectives and previous convergence analyses require feasible iterates. Moreover, some of the convergence conditions are difficult to verify for practical stochastic algorithms, and some of the theoretical results only apply to specific algorithms. First, this article presents some technical conditions that guarantee the convergence of a general class of adaptive stochastic algorithms for constrained black-box global optimization that do not require iterates to be always feasible and applies them to practical algorithms, including an evolutionary algorithm. The conditions are only required for a subsequence of the iterations and provide a recipe for making any algorithm converge to the global minimum in a probabilistic sense.

0,Risk-Averse Stochastic Programming and Distributionally Robust Optimization Via Operator Splitting,"This work deals with a broad class of convex optimization problems under uncertainty. The approach is to pose the original problem as one of finding a zero of the sum of two appropriate monotone operators, which is solved by the celebrated Douglas-Rachford splitting method. The resulting algorithm, suitable for risk-averse stochastic programs and distributionally robust optimization with fixed support, separates the random cost mapping from the risk function composing the problem’s objective. Such a separation is exploited to compute iterates by alternating projections onto different convex sets. Scenario subproblems, free from the risk function and thus parallelizable, are projections onto the cost mappings’ epigraphs. The risk function is handled in an independent and dedicated step consisting of evaluating its proximal mapping that, in many important cases, amounts to projecting onto a certain ambiguity set. Variables get updated by straightforward projections on subspaces through independent computations for the various scenarios. The investigated approach enjoys significant flexibility and opens the way to handle, in a single algorithm, several classes of risk measures and ambiguity sets.",Welington de Oliveira,Set-Valued and Variational Analysis,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11228-021-00600-5,"Multistage stochastic programs,Distributionally robust optimization,ADMM,Progressive hedging,Splitting methods"

0,Worst-Case Violation of Sampled Convex Programs for Optimization with Uncertainty,"A deterministic approach called robust optimization has been recently proposed to deal with optimization problems including inexact data, i.e., uncertainty. The basic idea of robust optimization is to seek a solution that is guaranteed to perform well in terms of feasibility and near-optimality for all possible realizations of the uncertain input data. To solve robust optimization problems, Calafiore and Campi have proposed a randomized approach based on sampling of constraints, where the number of samples is determined so that only a small portion of the original constraints is violated by the randomized solution. Our main concern is not only the probability of violation, but also the degree of violation, i.e., the worst-case violation. We derive an upper bound of the worst-case violation for the sampled convex programs and consider the relation between the probability of violation and the worst-case violation. The probability of violation and the degree of violation are simultaneously bounded by a prescribed value when the number of random samples is large enough. In addition, a confidence interval of the optimal value is obtained when the objective function includes uncertainty. Our method is applicable to not only a bounded uncertainty set but also an unbounded one. Hence, the scope of our method includes random sampling following an unbounded distribution such as the normal distribution.",Takafumi Kanamori1 & Akiko Takeda,Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-011-9923-2,"Uncertainty,Sampled convex programs,Worst-case violation,Violation probability,Uniform lower bound"

0,The distribution of membrane current in nerve with longitudinal linearly increasing applied current,"The distribution of membrane current in three models of nerve, when a longitudinal, linearly increasing current is applied, is derived. For the simple core conductor model it is shown that, if the region over which such a current is applied is large compared to the space constant of the model, the membrane current in the mid-portion of the region is a constant, independent of the distance, the time following the application of the current, and the impedance of the membrane. The effect of nonlinear membrane electrical properties is discussed. It is further shown that these conclusions apply equally to the case in which the simple model is surrounded by another concentric sheath (the double cable model). In this case the impedance of the sheath does not influence the membrane current in the mid-polar region.

0,"Imaginary geometry IV: interior rays, whole-plane reversibility, and space-filling trees","We establish existence and uniqueness for Gaussian free field flow lines started at interior points of a planar domain. We interpret these as rays of a random geometry with imaginary curvature and describe the way distinct rays intersect each other and the boundary. Previous works in this series treat rays started at boundary points and use Gaussian free field machinery to determine which chordal \(\mathrm{SLE}_\kappa (\rho _1; \rho _2)\) processes are time-reversible when \(\kappa < 8\). Here we extend these results to whole-plane \(\mathrm{SLE}_\kappa (\rho )\) and establish continuity and transience of these paths. In particular, we extend ordinary whole-plane SLE reversibility (established by Zhan for \(\kappa \in [0,4]\)) to all \(\kappa \in [0,8]\). We also show that the rays of a given angle (with variable starting point) form a space-filling planar tree. Each branch is a form of \(\mathrm{SLE}_\kappa \) for some \(\kappa \in (0, 4)\), and the curve that traces the tree in the natural order (hitting x before y if the branch from x is left of the branch from y) is a space-filling form of \(\mathrm{SLE}_{\kappa '}\) where \(\kappa ':= 16/\kappa \in (4, \infty )\). By varying the boundary data we obtain, for each \(\kappa '>4\), a family of space-filling variants of \(\mathrm{SLE}_{\kappa '}(\rho )\) whose time reversals belong to the same family. When \(\kappa ' \ge 8\), ordinary \(\mathrm{SLE}_{\kappa '}\) belongs to this family, and our result shows that its time-reversal is \(\mathrm{SLE}_{\kappa '}(\kappa '/2 - 4; \kappa '/2 - 4)\). As applications of this theory, we obtain the local finiteness of \(\mathrm{CLE}_{\kappa '}\), for \(\kappa ' \in (4,8)\), and describe the laws of the boundaries of \(\mathrm{SLE}_{\kappa '}\) processes stopped at stopping times.","Jason Miller1,2 nAff3 & Scott Sheffield",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-017-0780-2,60J67

0,Hybrid algorithms for placement of virtual machines across geo-separated data centers,"Cloud computing has emerged as a new paradigm for hosting and supplying services over the Internet. This technology has brought many benefits, such as eliminating the need for maintaining expensive computing hardware. With an increasing demand for cloud computing, providing performance guarantees for applications that run over cloud become important. Applications can be abstracted into a set of virtual machines with certain guarantees depicting the quality of service of the application. In this paper, we consider the placement of these virtual machines across multiple data centers (VMPlacement), meeting the quality of service requirements while minimizing the bandwidth cost of the data centers. This problem is a generalization of the NP-hard generalized quadratic assignment problem (GQAP). In this paper, we present a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure and a biased random-key genetic algorithm, both hybridized with a path-relinking strategy and a local search based on variable neighborhood descent for solving this problem. The hybrid heuristics are also tested on instances of the GQAP. We show that both algorithms are effective in quickly solving small and large instances of VMPlacement problem, especially when the path-relinking is used. For GQAP, the results outperform the previous state-of-the-art algorithms.","Fernando Stefanello

0,Practical Study on the Fuzzy Risk of Flood Disasters,"The simplest way to perform a fuzzy risk assessment is to calculate the fuzzy expected value and convert fuzzy risk into non-fuzzy risk, i.e., a crisp value. In doing so, there is a transition from the fuzzy set to the crisp set. Therefore, the first step is to define an α level value, and then select the elements x with a subordinate degree A(x)≥α. The higher the value of α, the lower the degree of uncertainty—the probability is closer to its true value. The lower the value of α, the higher the degree of uncertainty—this results in a lower probability serviceability. The possibility level α is dependant on technical conditions and knowledge. A fuzzy expected value of the possibility-probability distribution is a set with 
\(\underline{E}_{\,\alpha}(x)\) 
and 
\(\overline{E}_{\alpha}(x)\) 
as its boundaries. The fuzzy expected values 
\(\underline{E}_{\,\alpha}(x)\) 
and 
\(\overline{E}_{\alpha}(x)\) 
of a possibility-probability distribution represent the fuzzy risk values being calculated. Therefore, we can obtain a conservative risk value, a venture risk value and a maximum probability risk value. Under such an α level, three risk values can be calculated. As α adopts all values throughout the set [0,1], it is possible to obtain a series of risk values. Therefore, the fuzzy risk may be a multi-valued risk or set-valued risk. Calculation of the fuzzy expected value of flood risk in the Jinhua River basin has been performed based on the interior-outer set model. Selection of an α value depends on the confidence in different groups of people, while selection of a conservative risk value or venture risk value depends on the risk preference of these people.",Lihua Feng1 & Gaoyuan Luo,Acta Applicandae Mathematicae,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10440-008-9305-4,"Interior-outer set model,

Different models can be developed for describing static connectivity or dynamical processes on a network topology. In this study, classical network connectivity and influence spreading models are used as examples for network models. Analysis of results is based on a probability matrix describing interactions between all pairs of nodes in the network. One popular research area has been detecting communities and their structure in complex networks. The community detection method of this study is based on optimising a quality function calculated from the probability matrix. The same method is proposed for detecting underlying groups of nodes that are building blocks of different sub-communities in the network structure. We present different quantitative measures for comparing and ranking solutions of the community detection algorithm. These measures describe properties of sub-communities: strength of a community, probability of formation and robustness of composition. The main contribution of this study is proposing a common methodology for analysing network structure and dynamics on complex networks. We illustrate the community detection methods with two small network topologies. In the case of network spreading models, time development of spreading in the network can be studied.

0,Persistence in fluctuating environments,"Understanding under what conditions interacting populations, whether they be plants, animals, or viral particles, coexist is a question of theoretical and practical importance in population biology. Both biotic interactions and environmental fluctuations are key factors that can facilitate or disrupt coexistence. To better understand this interplay between these deterministic and stochastic forces, we develop a mathematical theory extending the nonlinear theory of permanence for deterministic systems to stochastic difference and differential equations. Our condition for coexistence requires that there is a fixed set of weights associated with the interacting populations and this weighted combination of populations’ invasion rates is positive for any (ergodic) stationary distribution associated with a subcollection of populations. Here, an invasion rate corresponds to an average per-capita growth rate along a stationary distribution. When this condition holds and there is sufficient noise in the system, we show that the populations approach a unique positive stationary distribution. Moreover, we show that our coexistence criterion is robust to small perturbations of the model functions. Using this theory, we illustrate that (i) environmental noise enhances or inhibits coexistence in communities with rock-paper-scissor dynamics depending on correlations between interspecific demographic rates, (ii) stochastic variation in mortality rates has no effect on the coexistence criteria for discrete-time Lotka–Volterra communities, and (iii) random forcing can promote genetic diversity in the presence of exploitative interactions.

The shot noise process is used for the claim intensity function within the Cox process. The Cox process with shot noise intensity is examined by piecewise deterministic Markov process theory. We apply the model to price stop-loss catastrophe reinsurance contract and catastrophe insurance derivatives. The asymptotic distribution of the claim intensity is used to derive pricing formulae for stop-loss reinsurance contract for catastrophic events and catastrophe insurance derivatives. We assume that there is an absence of arbitrage opportunities in the market to obtain the gross premium for stop-loss reinsurance contract and arbitrage-free prices for insurance derivatives.

0,On the stochastic evolution of finite populations,"This work is a systematic study of discrete Markov chains that are used to describe the evolution of a two-types population. Motivated by results valid for the well-known Moran (M) and Wright–Fisher (WF) processes, we define a general class of Markov chains models which we term the Kimura class. It comprises the majority of the models used in population genetics, and we show that many well-known results valid for M and WF processes are still valid in this class. In all Kimura processes, a mutant gene will either fixate or become extinct, and we present a necessary and sufficient condition for such processes to have the probability of fixation strictly increasing in the initial frequency of mutants. This condition implies that there are WF processes with decreasing fixation probability—in contradistinction to M processes which always have strictly increasing fixation probability. As a by-product, we show that an increasing fixation probability defines uniquely an M or WF process which realises it, and that any fixation probability with no state having trivial fixation can be realised by at least some WF process. These results are extended to a subclass of processes that are suitable for describing time-inhomogeneous dynamics. We also discuss the traditional identification of frequency dependent fitnesses and pay-offs, extensively used in evolutionary game theory, the role of weak selection when the population is finite, and the relations between jumps in evolutionary processes and frequency dependent fitnesses.","Fabio A.

The objective of this paper is to study the effect of under-reporting in epidemics by considering the stochastic Markovian SIR epidemic in which various reporting processes are incorporated. In particular, we first investigate the effect on the estimation process of ignoring under-reporting when it is present in an epidemic outbreak. We show that such an approach leads to under-estimation of the infection rate and the reproduction number. Secondly, by allowing for the fact that under-reporting is occurring, we develop suitable models for estimation of the epidemic parameters and explore how well the reporting rate and other model parameters can be estimated. We consider the case of a constant reporting probability and also more realistic assumptions which involve the reporting probability depending on time or the source of infection for each infected individual. Due to the incomplete nature of the data and reporting process, the Bayesian approach provides a natural modelling framework and we perform inference using data augmentation and reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.","Kokouvi M.

0,Uncertain convex programs: randomized solutions and confidence levels,"Many engineering problems can be cast as optimization problems subject to convex constraints that are parameterized by an uncertainty or ‘instance’ parameter. Two main approaches are generally available to tackle constrained optimization problems in presence of uncertainty: robust optimization and chance-constrained optimization. Robust optimization is a deterministic paradigm where one seeks a solution which simultaneously satisfies all possible constraint instances. In chance-constrained optimization a probability distribution is instead assumed on the uncertain parameters, and the constraints are enforced up to a pre-specified level of probability. Unfortunately however, both approaches lead to computationally intractable problem formulations.In this paper, we consider an alternative ‘randomized’ or ‘scenario’ approach for dealing with uncertainty in optimization, based on constraint sampling. In particular, we study the constrained optimization problem resulting by taking into account only a finite set of N constraints, chosen at random among the possible constraint instances of the uncertain problem. We show that the resulting randomized solution fails to satisfy only a small portion of the original constraints, provided that a sufficient number of samples is drawn. Our key result is to provide an efficient and explicit bound on the measure (probability or volume) of the original constraints that are possibly violated by the randomized solution.

0,Making sense of Born’s rule \(p_\alpha =\Vert \varPsi _\alpha \Vert ^2\) with the many-minds interpretation,"This work is an attempt to justify Born’s rule within the framework of the many-minds interpretation seen as a development of the many-worlds interpretation of Everett. More precisely, here we develop a unitary model of many-minds based on the work of Albert and Loewer (Synthese 77:195, 1988). At the difference of previous models ours is not genuinely stochastic and dualistic and also involves some classical-like randomness concerning the initial conditions of the Universe. We also compare the present method for recovering Born’s rule with previous works based on decision theory à la Deutsch, Wallace, and envariance à la Zurek and show how these approaches are connected to our model.","Aurélien Drezet

0,On the characteristics of reporting ADL limitations and formal LTC usage across Europe,"The increase in the proportion of elderly people in most industrialized countries triggers higher demand for long-term care (LTC) associated with limitations in activities of daily living (ADL). The aim of this research is to derive the drivers affecting the probability of reporting limitations in ADL and the probability of demanding formal LTC, e.g., personal care and services in domestic tasks. By using the most recent wave of a cross-national European survey on individuals aged over 50 years (SHARE, wave 6), we develop econometric models for identifying the effect of demographic, social and medical factors on ADL limitations and formal LTC along five conjectures. On the one hand, we analyze functional limitations and we find that characteristics such as the age, the gender, the wealth status and the education level influence the probability to report limitations. Further, while we find that pathologies significantly increase the probability to become dependent in general, the effect of cancer is lower. On the other hand, we find again an influence of the demographic and social factors on the probability to use formal LTC. We emphasize on the decrease in the probability due to the presence of the partner in the household, in particular for housekeeping tasks. This is less the case for help related with personal care. In addition, we note that pathologies such as cancer have no influence on the probability to report formal LTC while others like mental and Parkinson diseases highly increase it. We find that elderly living in countries with LTC family care schemes report less formal care than in others. This indicates the importance of LTC policies. Finally, we validate the robustness of our results by applying the models to data from earlier waves of the survey. Our findings give insights for the underwriting standards to be used in future LTC insurance products and for the design of LTC policy environments across Europe.","Michel Fuino1, Iegor Rudnytskyi1 & Joël Wagner

0,Robust DC optimal power flow with modeling of solar power supply uncertainty via R-vine copulas,"We present a robust approximation of joint chance constrained DC optimal power flow in combination with a model-based prediction of uncertain power supply via R-vine copulas. It is applied to optimize the discrete curtailment of solar feed-in in an electrical distribution network and guarantees network stability under fluctuating feed-in. This is modeled by a two-stage mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem proposed by Aigner et al. (Eur J Oper Res (2022) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2021.10.051). The solution approach is based on the approximation of chance constraints via robust constraints using suitable uncertainty sets. The resulting robust optimization problem has a known equivalent tractable reformulation. To compute uncertainty sets that lead to an inner approximation of the stochastic problem, an R-vine copula model is fitted to the distribution of the multi-dimensional power forecast error, i.e., the difference between the forecasted solar power and the measured feed-in at several network nodes. The uncertainty sets are determined by encompassing a sufficient number of samples drawn from the R-vine copula model. Furthermore, an enhanced algorithm is proposed to fit R-vine copulas which can be used to draw conditional samples for given solar radiation forecasts. The experimental results obtained for real-world weather and network data demonstrate the effectiveness of the combination of stochastic programming and model-based prediction of uncertainty via copulas. We improve the outcomes of previous work by showing that the resulting uncertainty sets are much smaller and lead to less conservative solutions while maintaining the same probabilistic guarantees.","Kevin-Martin Aigner1 na1, Peter Schaumann2 na1, Freimut von Loeper2, Alexander Martin1,3, Volker Schmidt2 & …Frauke Liers",Optimization and Engineering,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-022-09761-0,"chance constrained programming,optimal power flow,robust optimization,multiple prediction interval,R-vine copula,conditional uncertainty set"

Given a potential \(A:S^1 \rightarrow {\mathbb{R}}\) we are interested in exhibiting in several examples the explicit expression for the calibrated subaction \(V: S^1 \rightarrow {\mathbb{R}}\) for A. The action of the 1/2 iterative procedure \({\mathcal{G}}\), acting on continuous functions \(f: S^1 \rightarrow {\mathbb{R}}\), was analyzed in a companion paper. Given an initial condition \(f_0\), the sequence, \({\mathcal{G}}^n(f_0)\) will converge to a subaction. The sharp numerical evidence obtained from this iteration allow us to guess explicit expressions for the subaction in several worked examples: among them for \(A(x) = \sin ^2 ( 2 \pi x)\) and \(A(x) = \sin ( 2 \pi x)\). Here, among other things, we present piecewise analytical expressions for several calibrated subactions. The iterative procedure can also be applied to the estimation of the joint spectral radius of matrices. We also analyze the iteration of \({\mathcal{G}}\) when the subaction is not unique. Moreover, we briefly present the version of the 1/2 iterative procedure for the estimation of the main eigenfunction of the Ruelle operator.","Hermes H. Ferreira1, Artur O. Lopes

0,Extending Transition Path Theory: Periodically Driven and Finite-Time Dynamics,"Given two distinct subsets A, B in the state space of some dynamical system, transition path theory (TPT) was successfully used to describe the statistical behavior of transitions from A to B in the ergodic limit of the stationary system. We derive generalizations of TPT that remove the requirements of stationarity and of the ergodic limit and provide this powerful tool for the analysis of other dynamical scenarios: periodically forced dynamics and time-dependent finite-time systems. This is partially motivated by studying applications such as climate, ocean, and social dynamics. On simple model examples, we show how the new tools are able to deliver quantitative understanding about the statistical behavior of such systems. We also point out explicit cases where the more general dynamical regimes show different behaviors to their stationary counterparts, linking these tools directly to bifurcations in non-deterministic systems.

0,On the Convergence of Inhomogeneous Markov Chains Approximating Equilibrium Placements of Flexible Objects,"This paper deals with the minimization of local forces in two-dimensional placements of flexible objects within rigid boundaries. The objects are disks of the same size but, in general, of different materials. Potential applications include the design of new amorphous polymeric and related granular materials as well as the design of package cushioning systems. The problem is considered on a grid structure with a fixed step size w and for a fixed diameter of the discs, i.e., the number of placed disks may increase as the size of the placement region increases. The near-equilibrium configurations have to be calculated from uniformly distributed random initial placements. The final arrangements of disks must ensure that any particular object is deformed only within the limits of elasticity of the material. The main result concerns ε-approximations of the probability distribution on the set of equilibrium placements. Under a natural assumption about the configuration space, we prove that a run-time of nγ+logO(1)(1/ɛ} is sufficient to approach with probability 1 – ε the minimum value of the objective function, where γ depends on the maximum Γ of the escape depth of local minima within the underlying energy landscape. The result is derived from a careful analysis of the interaction among probabilities assigned to configurations from adjacent distance levels to minimum placements. The overall approach for estimating the convergence rate is relatively independent of the particular placement problem and can be applied to various optimization problems with similar properties of the associated landscape of the objective function.","A.

Statistical uncertainties involving both structural and loading properties are considered. The concept is based on the separation of structural reliability analyses and the optimization procedures.

In numerical examinations of higher-order gamma distributions for removal probability, we discover an unexpected pattern in maximum fraction of population infected. We develop from first principles of probability an eighth-order system of ordinary differential equations to model effects of isolation and quarantine. We derive analytical expressions for reproduction numbers modeling isolation and quarantine when applied separately and together and verify them numerically. We quantify strength and speed required of these interventions to contain epidemics of varying severity and examine how their effectiveness depends on when they begin. We find that effectiveness is highly sensitive to small changes of intervention strength in a critical region.

0,Scaling limits of multi-type Markov Branching trees,"We introduce multi-type Markov Branching trees, which are simple random population tree models where individuals are characterized by their size and their type and give rise to (size,type)-children in a Galton–Watson fashion, with the rule that the size of any individual is at least the sum of the sizes of its children. Assuming that the macroscopic size-splittings are rare, we describe the scaling limits of multi-type Markov Branching trees in terms of multi-type self-similar fragmentation trees. We observe three different regimes according to whether the probability of type change of a size-biased child is proportional to the probability of macroscopic splitting (the critical regime, in which we get in the limit multi-type fragmentation trees with indeed several types), smaller than the probability of macroscopic splitting (the solo regime, in which the limit trees are monotype as we never see a type change), or larger than the probability of macroscopic splitting (the mixing regime, in which case the types mix in the limit and we get monotype fragmentation trees). This framework allows us to unify models which may a priori seem quite different, a strength which we illustrate with two notable applications. The first one concerns the description of the scaling limits of growing models of random trees built by gluing at each step on the current structure a finite tree picked randomly in a finite alphabet of trees, extending Rémy’s well-known algorithm for the generation of uniform binary trees to a fairly broad framework. We are then either in the critical regime with multi-type fragmentation trees in the scaling limit, or in the solo regime. The second application concerns the scaling limits of large multi-type critical Galton–Watson trees when the offspring distributions all have finite second moments. This topic has already been studied but our approach gives a different proof and we improve on previous results by relaxing some hypotheses. We are then in the mixing regime: the scaling limits are always multiple of the Brownian CRT, a pure monotype fragmentation tree in our framework.","Bénédicte Haas

The key components in the proof include a two-sided isomorphic estimator on distances between class members, which is based on the median-of-means; and an almost isometric lower bound of the form \(N^{-1}\sum _{i=1}^N f^2(X_i) \ge (1-\zeta )\mathbb {E}f^2\) which holds uniformly in the class.

0,High Performance Computing in the Optimization of Software Test Plans,"Statistical software testing is an increasingly popular method in the software development cycle. An exact modeling of the usage profiles of a software system is an indispensable prerequisite for statistical testing. Recently, new techniques for obtaining optimal usage profiles even the presence of rarely used critical functions have been introduced. Although these techniques deliver unbiased dependability estimates with a single model (instead of using multiple models as it is the current practice) their applicability is hampered by their prohibitive computational complexity.In this paper we demonstrate that these techniques can be effectively employed even for large software systems by exploiting high performance computing. We discuss the parallelism potential within these techniques and present a parallel implementation based on a high level parallel language—High Performance Fortran. Our techniques are general enough to allow an efficient optimization of medium to large scale test plans on high-end parallel machines as well as on more cost effective PC-clusters.

0,Recent Advances in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement learning is bedeviled by the curse of dimensionality: the number of parameters to be learned grows exponentially with the size of any compact encoding of a state. Recent attempts to combat the curse of dimensionality have turned to principled ways of exploiting temporal abstraction, where decisions are not required at each step, but rather invoke the execution of temporally-extended activities which follow their own policies until termination. This leads naturally to hierarchical control architectures and associated learning algorithms. We review several approaches to temporal abstraction and hierarchical organization that machine learning researchers have recently developed. Common to these approaches is a reliance on the theory of semi-Markov decision processes, which we emphasize in our review. We then discuss extensions of these ideas to concurrent activities, multiagent coordination, and hierarchical memory for addressing partial observability. Concluding remarks address open challenges facing the further development of reinforcement learning in a hierarchical setting.",Andrew G.

0,On the principal components of sample covariance matrices,"We introduce a class of \(M \times M\) sample covariance matrices \({\mathcal {Q}}\) which subsumes and generalizes several previous models. The associated population covariance matrix \(\Sigma = \mathbb {E}{\mathcal {Q}}\) is assumed to differ from the identity by a matrix of bounded rank. All quantities except the rank of \(\Sigma - I_M\) may depend on \(M\) in an arbitrary fashion. We investigate the principal components, i.e. the top eigenvalues and eigenvectors, of \({\mathcal {Q}}\). We derive precise large deviation estimates on the generalized components \(\langle {\mathbf{{w}}} , {\varvec{\xi }_i}\rangle \) of the outlier and non-outlier eigenvectors \(\varvec{\xi }_i\). Our results also hold near the so-called BBP transition, where outliers are created or annihilated, and for degenerate or near-degenerate outliers. We believe the obtained rates of convergence to be optimal. In addition, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the generalized components of the non-outlier eigenvectors. A novel observation arising from our results is that, unlike the eigenvalues, the eigenvectors of the principal components contain information about the subcritical spikes of \(\Sigma \). The proofs use several results on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the uncorrelated matrix \({\mathcal {Q}}\), satisfying \(\mathbb {E}{\mathcal {Q}} = I_M\), as input: the isotropic local Marchenko–Pastur law established in Bloemendal et al.

0,Proposal of Japanese Vocabulary Difficulty Level Dictionaries for Automated Essay Scoring Support System Using Rubric,"We are developing a Moodle plug-in, which is an AES (automated essay scoring) support system for the basic education of university students. Our system evaluates essays based on rubric, which has five evaluation viewpoints “Contents, Structure, Evidence, Style, and Skill”. Vocabulary level is one of the scoring items of Skill. It is calculated using Japanese Language Learners’ Dictionaries constructed by Sunakawa et al. Since this does not fully cover the words used in the student-level essays, we found that there is a problem with the accuracy of the vocabulary level scoring. In this paper, we propose to construct comprehensive Japanese vocabulary difficulty level dictionaries using Japanese Wikipedia as the corpus. We apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to the Wikipedia corpus and find the word appearance probability as one of the indexes of word difficulty. We use the TF-IDF value instead of the LDA value of the words, which rarely appears. As a result, we constructed highly comprehensive Japanese vocabulary difficulty level dictionaries. We confirmed that the vocabulary level can be scored for all words in the test dataset by using the constructed dictionaries.

This extends recent results of Nesterov (SIAM J Optim 22(2): 341–362, 2012), which cover the smooth case, to composite minimization, while at the same time improving the complexity by the factor of 4 and removing \(\varepsilon \) from the logarithmic term. More importantly, in contrast with the aforementioned work in which the author achieves the results by applying the method to a regularized version of the objective function with an unknown scaling factor, we show that this is not necessary, thus achieving first true iteration complexity bounds. For strongly convex functions the method converges linearly. In the smooth case we also allow for arbitrary probability vectors and non-Euclidean norms. Finally, we demonstrate numerically that the algorithm is able to solve huge-scale \(\ell _1\)-regularized least squares problems with a billion variables.",Peter Richtárik1 & Martin Takáč,Mathematical Programming,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-012-0614-z,"Block coordinate descent,Huge-scale optimization, Composite minimization,Iteration complexity,Convex optimization,LASSO, Sparse regression,Gradient descent ,Coordinate relaxation,Gauss–Seidel method"
0,Projective Limit Techniques for the Infinite Dimensional Moment Problem,"We deal with the following general version of the classical moment problem: when can a linear functional on a unital commutative real algebra A be represented as an integral with respect to a Radon measure on the character space X(A) of A equipped with the Borel \(\sigma \)-algebra generated by the weak topology? We approach this problem by constructing X(A) as a projective limit of the character spaces of all finitely generated unital subalgebras of A. Using some fundamental results for measures on projective limits of measurable spaces, we determine a criterion for the existence of an integral representation of a linear functional on A with respect to a measure on the cylinder \(\sigma \)-algebra on X(A) (resp. a Radon measure on the Borel \(\sigma \)-algebra on X(A)) provided that for any finitely generated unital subalgebra of A the corresponding moment problem is solvable. We also investigate how to localize the support of representing measures for linear functionals on A. These results allow us to establish infinite dimensional analogues of the classical Riesz-Haviland and Nussbaum theorems as well as a representation theorem for linear functionals non-negative on a “partially Archimedean” quadratic module of A. Our results in particular apply to the case when A is the algebra of polynomials in infinitely many variables or the symmetric tensor algebra of a real infinite dimensional vector space, providing a unified setting which enables comparisons between some recent results for these instances of the moment problem.","Maria Infusino

Recent works have shown that for all ξ > 0, the LFPP metrics, appropriately re-scaled, admit non-trivial subsequential limiting metrics. In the case ξ < ξcrit ≈ 0.41, it has been shown that the subsequential limit is unique and defines a metric on γ-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) γ = γ(ξ) ∈ (0, 2). We prove that for all ξ > 0, each possible subsequential limiting metric is nearly bi-Lipschitz equivalent to the LFPP metric \(D_h^\epsilon\) when ∊ is small, even if ∊ does not belong to the appropriate subsequence. Using this result, we obtain bounds for the scaling constants for LFPP which are sharp up to polylogarithmic factors. We also prove that any two subsequential limiting metrics are bi-Lipschitz equivalent.

0,The asymmetric random cluster model and comparison of Ising and Potts models," We introduce the asymmetric random cluster (or ARC) model, which is a graphical representation of the Potts lattice gas, and establish its basic properties. The ARC model allows a rich variety of comparisons (in the FKG sense) between models with different parameter values; we give, for example, values (β, h) for which the 0‘s configuration in the Potts lattice gas is dominated by the “+” configuration of the (β, h) Ising model. The Potts model, with possibly an external field applied to one of the spins, is a special case of the Potts lattice gas, which allows our comparisons to yield rigorous bounds on the critical temperatures of Potts models. For example, we obtain 0.571 ≤ 1 − exp(−β
c
) ≤ 0.600 for the 9-state Potts model on the hexagonal lattice. Another comparison bounds the movement of the critical line when a small Potts interaction is added to a lattice gas which otherwise has only interparticle attraction. ARC models can also be compared to related models such as the partial FK model, obtained by deleting a fraction of the nonsingleton clusters from a realization of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn random cluster model.

0,Cluster capacity functionals and isomorphism theorems for Gaussian free fields,"We investigate level sets of the Gaussian free field on continuous transient metric graphs \(\widetilde{{\mathcal {G}}}\) and study the capacity of its level set clusters. We prove, without any further assumption on the base graph \({\mathcal {G}}\), that the capacity of sign clusters on \(\widetilde{{\mathcal {G}}}\) is finite almost surely. This leads to a new and effective criterion to determine whether the sign clusters of the free field on \(\widetilde{{\mathcal {G}}}\) are bounded or not. It also elucidates why the critical parameter for percolation of level sets on \(\widetilde{{\mathcal {G}}}\) vanishes in most instances in the massless case and establishes the continuity of this phase transition in a wide range of cases, including all vertex-transitive graphs. When the sign clusters on \(\widetilde{{\mathcal {G}}}\) do not percolate, we further determine by means of isomorphism theory the exact law of the capacity of compact clusters at any height. Specifically, we derive this law from an extension of Sznitman’s refinement of Lupu’s recent isomorphism theorem relating the free field and random interlacements, proved along the way, and which holds under the sole assumption that sign clusters on \(\widetilde{{\mathcal {G}}}\) are bounded. Finally, we show that the law of the cluster capacity functionals obtained in this way actually characterizes the isomorphism theorem, i.e. the two are equivalent.","Alexander Drewitz

Previous works have shown that selecting a proper combination of leader and archiving methods, which is a challenging task, improves the search ability of the algorithm. A previous study has employed a simple hyper-heuristic to select these components, obtaining good results. In this research, an analysis is made to verify if using more advanced heuristic selection methods improves the search ability of the algorithm. Empirical studies are conducted to investigate this hypothesis. In these studies, first, four heuristic selection methods are compared: a choice function, a multi-armed bandit, a random one, and the previously proposed roulette wheel. A second study is made to identify if it is best to adapt only the leader method, the archiving method, or both simultaneously. Moreover, the influence of the interval used to replace the low-level heuristic is analyzed. At last, a final study compares the best variant to a hyper-heuristic framework that combines a Multi-Armed Bandit algorithm into the multi-objective optimization based on decomposition with dynamical resource allocation (MOEA/D-DRA) and a state-of-the-art MOPSO.

0,A multiscale maximum entropy moment closure for locally regulated space–time point process models of population dynamics,"The prevalence of structure in biological populations challenges fundamental assumptions at the heart of continuum models of population dynamics based only on mean densities (local or global). Individual-based models (IBMs) were introduced during the last decade in an attempt to overcome this limitation by following explicitly each individual in the population. Although the IBM approach has been quite useful, the capability to follow each individual usually comes at the expense of analytical tractability, which limits the generality of the statements that can be made. For the specific case of spatial structure in populations of sessile (and identical) organisms, space–time point processes with local regulation seem to cover the middle ground between analytical tractability and a higher degree of biological realism. This approach has shown that simplified representations of fecundity, local dispersal and density-dependent mortality weighted by the local competitive environment are sufficient to generate spatial patterns that mimic field observations. Continuum approximations of these stochastic processes try to distill their fundamental properties, and they keep track of not only mean densities, but also higher order spatial correlations. However, due to the non–linearities involved they result in infinite hierarchies of moment equations. This leads to the problem of finding a ‘moment closure’; that is, an appropriate order of (lower order) truncation, together with a method of expressing the highest order density not explicitly modelled in the truncated hierarchy in terms of the lower order densities. We use the principle of constrained maximum entropy to derive a closure relationship for truncation at second order using normalisation and the product densities of first and second orders as constraints, and apply it to one such hierarchy. The resulting ‘maxent’ closure is similar to the Kirkwood superposition approximation, or ‘power-3’ closure, but it is complemented with previously unknown correction terms that depend mainly on the avoidance function of an associated Poisson point process over the region for which third order correlations are irreducible. This domain of irreducible triplet correlations is found from an integral equation associated with the normalisation constraint. This also serves the purpose of a validation check, since a single, non-trivial domain can only be found if the assumptions of the closure are consistent with the predictions of the hierarchy. Comparisons between simulations of the point process, alternative heuristic closures, and the maxent closure show significant improvements in the ability of the truncated hierarchy to predict equilibrium values for mildly aggregated spatial patterns. However, the maxent closure performs comparatively poorly in segregated ones. Although the closure is applied in the context of point processes, the method does not require fixed locations to be valid, and can in principle be applied to problems where the particles move, provided that their correlation functions are stationary in space and time.","Michael Raghib1 nAff2, Nicholas A.

n} is symmetric and has finite range, this may be excluded.

0,Hypoellipticity and Ergodicity of the Wonham Filter as a Diffusion Process,"The ergodicity problem of the Wonham filter as a diffusion process is discussed. Since the Wonham equation is degenerate, we apply an ergodic theorem of degenerate Markov diffusions to the problem.

0,Collapse of attractors for ODEs under small random perturbations,"This paper concerns comparisons between attractors for random dynamical systems and their corresponding noiseless systems. It is shown that if a random dynamical system has negative time trajectories that are transient or explode with probability one, then the random attractor cannot contain any open set. The result applies to any Polish space and when applied to autonomous stochastic differential equations with additive noise requires only a mild dissipation of the drift. Additionally, following observations from numerical simulations in a previous paper, analytical results are presented proving that the random global attractors for a class of gradient-like stochastic differential equations consist of a single random point. Comparison with the noiseless system reveals that arbitrarily small non-degenerate additive white noise causes the deterministic global attractor, which may have non-zero dimension, to ‘collapse’. Unlike existing results of this type, no order preserving property is necessary.",Oliver M.

0,Optimal transport and Skorokhod embedding,"The Skorokhod embedding problem is to represent a given probability as the distribution of Brownian motion at a chosen stopping time. Over the last 50 years this has become one of the important classical problems in probability theory and a number of authors have constructed solutions with particular optimality properties. These constructions employ a variety of techniques ranging from excursion theory to potential and PDE theory and have been used in many different branches of pure and applied probability. We develop a new approach to Skorokhod embedding based on ideas and concepts from optimal mass transport. In analogy to the celebrated article of Gangbo and McCann on the geometry of optimal transport, we establish a geometric characterization of Skorokhod embeddings with desired optimality properties. This leads to a systematic method to construct optimal embeddings. It allows us, for the first time, to derive all known optimal Skorokhod embeddings as special cases of one unified construction and leads to a variety of new embeddings. While previous constructions typically used particular properties of Brownian motion, our approach applies to all sufficiently regular Markov processes.","Mathias Beiglböck1, Alexander M. G.

0,Recent Advances in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement learning is bedeviled by the curse of dimensionality: the number of parameters to be learned grows exponentially with the size of any compact encoding of a state. Recent attempts to combat the curse of dimensionality have turned to principled ways of exploiting temporal abstraction, where decisions are not required at each step, but rather invoke the execution of temporally-extended activities which follow their own policies until termination. This leads naturally to hierarchical control architectures and associated learning algorithms. We review several approaches to temporal abstraction and hierarchical organization that machine learning researchers have recently developed. Common to these approaches is a reliance on the theory of semi-Markov decision processes, which we emphasize in our review. We then discuss extensions of these ideas to concurrent activities, multiagent coordination, and hierarchical memory for addressing partial observability.

0,LPI radar network optimization based on geometrical measurement fusion,"The power optimization problem and target assignment are investigated to improve low probability of interception (LPI) in a distributed radar network system. The target geometrical localization error and probability of detection are considered as QoS metrics of the network. We introduce geometrical fusion gain as a metric to fuse information for measuring target localization by multiple radars. The problem is then considered as an optimization challenge based on measurement error covariance ellipses, which satisfy detection and localization accuracy of the network. The LPI problem can be solved with two different objectives for the optimization as it minimizes the maximum power and cuts down on total power. Due to the combinatorial nonconvex and nonlinear nature of the optimization problems, relaxations are considered to make the problems more tractable. They can be efficiently solved by dividing them into two subproblems. Firstly, there is the power allocation in which a framework is proposed to compute minimum required power for a radar assignment scheme by applying a numerical method. Secondly, there is the radar assignment in which a heuristic assignment algorithm is suggested to acquire sufficient radar-to-target assignment based on calculated power. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms considerably improve LPI performance while detection probability and target localization error constraints can be satisfied.",Seyed Mehdi Hosseini Andargoli1 & Javad Malekzadeh,Optimization and Engineering,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-018-9401-x,"LPI,Geometrical localization error,Power optimization,Target assignment"

0,"Randomness of the square root of 2 and the Giant Leap, Part 1","We prove that the “quadratic irrational rotation” exhibits a central limit theorem. More precisely, let α be an arbitrary real root of a quadratic equation with integer coefficients; say, α = \( \sqrt 2 \). Given any rational number 0 < x < 1 (say, x = 1/2) and any positive integer n, we count the number of elements of the sequence α, 2α, 3α, …, nα modulo 1 that fall into the subinterval [0, x]. We prove that this counting number satisfies a central limit theorem in the following sense. First, we subtract the “expected number” nx from the counting number, and study the typical fluctuation of this difference as n runs in a long interval 1 ≤ n ≤ N. Depending on α and x, we may need an extra additive correction of constant times logarithm of N; furthermore, what we always need is a multiplicative correction: division by (another) constant times square root of logarithm of N. If N is large, the distribution of this renormalized counting number, as n runs in 1 ≤ n ≤ N, is very close to the standard normal distribution (bell shaped curve), and the corresponding error term tends to zero as N tends to infinity. This is the main result of the paper (see Theorem 1.1). The proof is rather complicated and long; it has many interesting detours and byproducts. For example, the exact determination of the key constant factors (in the additive and multiplicative norming), which depend on α and x, requires surprisingly deep algebraic tools such as Dedeking sums, the class number of quadratic fields, and generalized class number formulas. The crucial property of a quadratic irrational is the periodicity of its continued fraction. Periodicity means self-similarity, which leads us to Markov chains: our basic probabilistic tool to prove the central limit theorem. We also use a lot of Fourier analysis.

The notion of B-\((\ell , r)\)-cumulants is defined via a bi-Boolean moment-cumulant formula over the lattice of bi-interval partitions, and it is demonstrated that bi-Boolean independence is equivalent to the vanishing of mixed B-\((\ell , r)\)-cumulants. Furthermore, some of the simplest bi-Boolean convolutions are considered, and a bi-Boolean partial \(\eta \)-transform is constructed for the study of limit theorems and infinite divisibility with respect to the additive bi-Boolean convolution. In particular, a bi-Boolean Lévy–Hinčin formula is derived in perfect analogy with the bi-free case, and some Bercovici–Pata type bijections are provided. Additional topics considered include the additive bi-Fermi convolution, some relations between the \((\ell , r)\)- and B-\((\ell , r)\)-cumulants, and bi-Boolean independence in an amalgamated setting.","Yinzheng Gu

0,An Evolution Model for Sequence Length Based on Residue Insertion–Deletion Independent of Substitution: An Application to the GC Content in Bacterial Genomes,"We introduce here a gene evolution model which is an extension of the time-continuous stochastic IDIS model (Lèbre and Michel in J. Comput. Biol. Chem. 34:259–267, 2010) to sequence length. This new IDISL (Insertion Deletion Independent of Substitution based on sequence Length) model gives an analytical expression of the residue occurrence probability p(l) at sequence length l depending on stochastically independent processes of substitution, insertion, and deletion. Furthermore, in contrast to all mathematical models in this research field, the substitution, insertion, and deletion parameters of the IDISL model are independent of each other. For any diagonalizable substitution matrix M, the residue occurrence probability p(l) is given as a function of the eigenvalues of M, the eigenvector matrix of M, a vector r of the residue insertion rates, a deletion rate d (unlike our previous IDIS model), and a vector of the initial residue occurrence probability p(l
0) at sequence length l
0.As another difference with the classical evolution approaches which mainly focus on sequence alignment, the IDIS class of models allows a mathematical analysis of the behavior of the residue occurrence probability according to either evolution time or sequence length. The length parameter can be associated with any nucleotide regions: genes, genomes, introns, repeats, 5′ and 3′ regions, etc. Three properties of the IDISL model are given in relation with the sequence length l: parameter scale, inverse evolution, and residue equilibrium distribution. Nucleotide occurrence probabilities are given in the particular case of the IDISL-HKY model, i.e. the IDISL model associated with the HKY asymmetric substitution matrix (Hasegawa et al. in J. Mol. Evol. 22:160–174, 1985).An application of the IDISL model is developed for a massive statistical analysis of GC content in all complete bacterial genomes available to date (894 non-anaerobic and anaerobic genomes). The IDISL-HKY model confirms the increase of the GC content with the genome length for two non-anaerobic taxonomic groups of bacterial genomes. Moreover, the non-linear modelling proposed by the IDISL model outperforms the most recent modelling of GC content in these bacterial genomes (Wang et al. in Biochem. Biophys. Res.

0,Phase transitions for detecting latent geometry in random graphs,"Random graphs with latent geometric structure are popular models of social and biological networks, with applications ranging from network user profiling to circuit design. These graphs are also of purely theoretical interest within computer science, probability and statistics. A fundamental initial question regarding these models is: when are these random graphs affected by their latent geometry and when are they indistinguishable from simpler models without latent structure, such as the Erdős–Rényi graph \({\mathcal {G}}(n, p)\)? We address this question for two of the most well-studied models of random graphs with latent geometry—the random intersection and random geometric graph. Our results are as follows: (a) The random intersection graph is defined by sampling n random sets \(S_1, S_2, \ldots , S_n\) by including each element of a set of size d in each \(S_i\) independently with probability \(\delta \), and including the edge \(\{i, j\}\) if \(S_i \cap S_j \ne \emptyset \). We prove that the random intersection graph converges in total variation to an Erdős–Rényi graph if \(d = {\tilde{\omega }}(n^3)\), and does not if \(d = o(n^3)\), for both dense and sparse edge densities p. This resolves an open problem in Fill et al. (Random Struct Algorithms 16(2):156–176, 2000), Rybarczyk (Random Struct Algorithms 38(1–2):205–234, 2011) and Kim et al. (Random Struct Algorithms 52(4):662–679, 2018). The same result was obtained simultaneously and independently by Bubeck et al. (When random intersection graphs lose geometry. Manuscript, 2019). (b) We strengthen the preceding argument to show that the matrix of random intersection sizes \(|S_i \cap S_j|\) converges in total variation to a symmetric matrix with independent Poisson entries. This yields the first total variation convergence result for \(\tau \)-random intersection graphs, where the edge \(\{i, j\}\) is included if \(|S_i \cap S_j| \ge \tau \). More precisely, our results imply that, if p is bounded away from 1, then the \(\tau \)-random intersection graph with edge density p converges to \({\mathcal {G}}(n, p)\) if \(d = \omega (\tau ^3 n^3)\). (c) The random geometric graph on \({\mathbb {S}}^{d - 1}\) is defined by sampling \(X_1, X_2, \dots , X_n\) uniformly at random from \({\mathbb {S}}^{d - 1}\) and including the edge \(\{i, j\}\) if \(\Vert X_i - X_j \Vert _2 \le \tau \). A result of Bubeck et al. (Random Struct Algorithms 49:503–532, 2016) showed that this model converges to \({\mathcal {G}}(n, p)\) in total variation, where p is chosen so that the models have matching edge densities, as long as \(d = \omega (n^3)\). It was conjectured in Bubeck et al. (2016) that this threshold decreases drastically for p small. We make the first progress towards this conjecture by showing convergence if \(d = {\tilde{\omega }}\left( \min \{ pn^3, p^2 n^{7/2} \} \right) \). Our proofs are a hybrid of combinatorial arguments, direct couplings and applications of information inequalities. Previous upper bounds on the total variation distance between random graphs with latent geometry and \({\mathcal {G}}(n, p)\) have typically not been both combinatorial and information-theoretic, while this interplay is essential to the sharpness of our bounds.","Matthew Brennan

In this paper, a MANET is modeled so that the length of each link in the network is considered as a birth-death process and the space is reused for n times in the flooding process, which is named as an n-spatial reuse birth-death model (n-SRBDM). We analyze the performance of the network under the dynamic source routing protocol (DSR) which is a famous reactive routing protocol. Some performance parameters of the route discovery are studied such as the probability distribution and the expectation of the flooding distance, the probability that a route is discovered by a query packet with a hop limit, the probability that a request packet finds a τ-time-valid route or a symmetric-valid route, and the average time needed to discover a valid route. For the route maintenance, some parameters are introduced and studied such as the average frequency of route recovery and the average time of a route to be valid. We compare the two models with spatial reuse and without spatial reuse by evaluating these parameters. It is shown that the spatial reuse model is much more effective in routing.","Wang Han-xing

0,Spatial Point Processes and Moment Dynamics in the Life Sciences: A Parsimonious Derivation and Some Extensions,"Mathematical models of dynamical systems in the life sciences typically assume that biological systems are spatially well mixed (the mean-field assumption). Even spatially explicit differential equation models typically make a local mean-field assumption. In effect, the assumption is that diffusive movement is strong enough to destroy spatial structure or that interactions between individuals are sufficiently long-range that the effects of spatial structure are weak. However, many important biophysical processes, such as chemical reactions of biomolecules within cells, disease transmission among humans, and dispersal of plants, have characteristic spatial scales that can generate strong spatial structure at the scale of individuals, with important effects on the behaviour of biological systems. This calls for mathematical methods that incorporate spatial structure. Here, we focus on one method, spatial-moment dynamics, which is based on the idea that important information about a spatial point process is held in its low-order spatial moments. The method goes beyond the dynamics of the first moment, i.e. the mean density or concentration of agents in space, in which no information about spatial structure is retained. By including the dynamics of at least the second moment, the method retains some information about spatial structure. Whereas mean-field models effectively use a closure assumption for the second moment, spatial-moment models use a closure assumption for the third (or a higher-order) moment. The aim of the paper was to provide a parsimonious and intuitive derivation of spatial-moment dynamic equations that is accessible to non-specialists. The derivation builds naturally from the first moment to the second, and we show how it can be extended to higher-order moments. Rather than tying the model to a specific biological example, we formulate a general model of movement, birth, and death of multiple types of interacting agents. This model can be applied to problems from a range of disciplines, some of which we discuss. The derivation is performed in a spatially non-homogeneous setting, to facilitate future investigations of biological scenarios, such as invasions, in which the spatial patterns are non-stationary over space.",Michael J.

In this paper we consider the probability that a random matrix \(A\in {\mathbbm {R}}^{m\times N}\) will serve as a bi-Lipschitz function \(A:{\mathcal {M}} \rightarrow \mathbbm {R}^m\) with bi-Lipschitz constants close to one for three different types of distributions on the \(m\times N\) matrices A, including two whose realizations are guaranteed to have fast matrix-vector multiplies. In doing so we generalize prior randomized metric space embedding results of this type for submanifolds of \(\mathbbm {R}^N\) by allowing for the presence of boundary while also retaining, and in some cases improving, prior lower bounds on the achievable embedding dimensions m for which one can expect small distortion with high probability. In particular, motivated by recent modewise embedding constructions for tensor data, herein we present a new class of highly structured distributions on matrices which outperform prior structured matrix distributions for embedding sufficiently low-dimensional submanifolds of \(\mathbbm {R}^N\) (with \(d\lesssim \sqrt{N}\)) with respect to both achievable embedding dimension, and computationally efficient realizations.

Non-Markov Random Process","Abstract We present some stochastic model of an infection spread among the adult population of
a certain region. The model bases on a random birth and death process supplemented by the point
distributions that reflect the durations of stay of individuals at various stages of the disease. The
durations of some stages of the disease are assumed constant. The model is a stochastic analog of
a system of delay differential equations and convolution integral equations describing the infection
spread in the deterministic approach. We address the problem of the infection eradication over
a time span comparable to the average lifetime of several generations of individuals. The results of
computational experiments are presented, where the dynamics of mathematical expectations of
the size of certain groups of individuals is studied and the probability of the infection eradication
over a finite time span is estimated using the Monte Carlo method.

0,Simulated annealing with asymptotic convergence for nonlinear constrained optimization,"In this paper, we present constrained simulated annealing (CSA), an algorithm that extends conventional simulated annealing to look for constrained local minima of nonlinear constrained optimization problems. The algorithm is based on the theory of extended saddle points (ESPs) that shows the one-to-one correspondence between a constrained local minimum and an ESP of the corresponding penalty function. CSA finds ESPs by systematically controlling probabilistic descents in the problem-variable subspace of the penalty function and probabilistic ascents in the penalty subspace. Based on the decomposition of the necessary and sufficient ESP condition into multiple necessary conditions, we present constraint-partitioned simulated annealing (CPSA) that exploits the locality of constraints in nonlinear optimization problems. CPSA leads to much lower complexity as compared to that of CSA by partitioning the constraints of a problem into significantly simpler subproblems, solving each independently, and resolving those violated global constraints across the subproblems. We prove that both CSA and CPSA asymptotically converge to a constrained global minimum with probability one in discrete optimization problems. The result extends conventional simulated annealing (SA), which guarantees asymptotic convergence in discrete unconstrained optimization, to that in discrete constrained optimization. Moreover, it establishes the condition under which optimal solutions can be found in constraint-partitioned nonlinear optimization problems.

The proposed algorithmic and reformulation framework applies to all types of distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization problems subjected to individual as well as joint chance constraints, with random right-hand side and technology vector, and under two types of uncertainties, called uncertain probabilities and continuum of realizations. For the uncertain probabilities (UP) case, we provide new mixed-integer linear programming reformulations for DRCCP problems.

We show that all proposed relaxations become exact reformulations when the decision variables are binary or bounded general integers. For DRCCP with individual chance constraint and random right-hand side under both the UP and CR cases, we also propose linear programming reformulations which need the ex-ante derivation of the worst-case value-at-risk via the solution of a finite series of linear programs determined via a bisection-type procedure.

The local value distribution is then used to define a Markov model to model the dynamics of a corresponding stochastic local search algorithm for k-sat. The model is evaluated by comparing the predicted algorithm dynamics to experimental results. In most cases the fit of the model to the experimental results is very good, but limitations are also recognised.

0,Stochastic Petri Net Based Modeling of Emergency Medical Rescue Processes during Earthquakes,"The post-disaster emergency medical rescue (EMR) is critical for people’s lives. This paper presents a stochastic Petri net (SPN) model based on the process of the rescue structure and a Markov chain model (MC), which is applied to the optimization of the EMR process, with the aim of identifying the key activities of EMR. An isomorphic MC model is developed for measuring and evaluating the time performance of the EMR process during earthquakes with the data of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. This paper provides a mathematical approach to simulate the process and to evaluate the efficiency of EMR. Simultaneously, the expressions of the steady state probabilities of this system under various states are obtained based on the MC, and the variations of the probabilities are analyzed by changing the firing rates for every transition. Based on the concrete data of the event, the authors find the most time consuming and critical activities for EMR decisions. The model results show that the key activities can improve the efficiency of medical rescue, providing decision-makers with rescue strategies during the large scale earthquake.","Huali Sun1, Jiaguo Liu2, Ziqiang Han3 & …Juan Jiang",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-020-9139-3,"Earthquake disaster,emergency medical rescue,Markov chain,stochastic petri net"
0,Active Acquisition of Information for Diagnosis and Supervisory Control of Discrete Event Systems,"This paper considers the problems of fault diagnosis and supervisory control in discrete event systems through the context of a new observation paradigm. For events that are considered observable, a cost is incurred each time a sensor is activated in an attempt to make an event observation. In such a situation the best strategy is to perform an “active acquisition” of information, i.e. to choose which sensors need to be activated based on the information state generated from the previous readings of the system. Depending on the sample path executed by the system, different sensors may be turned on or off at different stages of the process. We consider the active acquisition of information problem for both logical and stochastic discrete event systems. We consider three classes of increasing complexity: firstly, for acyclic systems where events are synchronized to clock ticks; secondly, for acyclic untimed systems; and lastly, for general cyclic automata. For each of these cases we define a notion of information state for the problem, determine conditions for the existence of an optimal policy, and construct a dynamic program to find an optimal policy where one exists. For large systems, a limited lookahead algorithm for computational savings is proposed.",David Thorsley1 & Demosthenis Teneketzis,Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10626-007-0027-y,"Failure diagnosis,Supervisory control,Measurement scheduling,Sensor optimization"
0,"Sparse Multi-Reference Alignment: Phase Retrieval, Uniform Uncertainty Principles and the Beltway Problem","Motivated by cutting-edge applications like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), the Multi-Reference Alignment (MRA) model entails the learning of an unknown signal from repeated measurements of its images under the latent action of a group of isometries and additive noise of magnitude \(\sigma \). Despite significant interest, a clear picture for understanding rates of estimation in this model has emerged only recently, particularly in the high-noise regime \(\sigma \gg 1\) that is highly relevant in applications. Recent investigations have revealed a remarkable asymptotic sample complexity of order \(\sigma ^6\) for certain signals whose Fourier transforms have full support, in stark contrast to the traditional \(\sigma ^2\) that arise in regular models. Often prohibitively large in practice, these results have prompted the investigation of variations around the MRA model where better sample complexity may be achieved. In this paper, we show that sparse signals exhibit an intermediate \(\sigma ^4\) sample complexity even in the classical MRA model. Further, we characterize the dependence of the estimation rate on the support size s as \(O_p(1)\) and \(O_p(s^{3.5})\) in the dilute and moderate regimes of sparsity respectively. Our techniques have implications for the problem of crystallographic phase retrieval, indicating a certain local uniqueness for the recovery of sparse signals from their power spectrum. Our results explore and exploit connections of the MRA estimation problem with two classical topics in applied mathematics: the beltway problem from combinatorial optimization, and uniform uncertainty principles from harmonic analysis. Our techniques include a certain enhanced form of the probabilistic method, which might be of general interest in its own right.",Subhroshekhar Ghosh1 & Philippe Rigollet,Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-022-09584-6,"Multi reference alignment,Cryo electron microscopy,Phase retrieval,Uncertainty principles,Fourier analysis,Beltway problem,Combinatorial optimization,Sparse signal processing,Sample complexity,Probabilistic method"
0,Multicriteria cuts and size-constrained k-cuts in hypergraphs,"We address counting and optimization variants of multicriteria global min-cut and size-constrained min-k-cut in hypergraphs. 

1.
For an r-rank n-vertex hypergraph endowed with t hyperedge-cost functions, we show that the number of multiobjective min-cuts is \(O(r2^{tr}n^{3t-1})\). In particular, this shows that the number of parametric min-cuts in constant rank hypergraphs for a constant number of criteria is strongly polynomial, thus resolving an open question by Aissi et al. (Math Program 154(1–2):3–28, 2015). In addition, we give randomized algorithms to enumerate all multiobjective min-cuts and all pareto-optimal cuts in strongly polynomial-time.


2.
We also address node-budgeted multiobjective min-cuts: For an n-vertex hypergraph endowed with t vertex-weight functions, we show that the number of node-budgeted multiobjective min-cuts is \(O(r2^{r}n^{t+2})\), where r is the rank of the hypergraph, and the number of node-budgeted b-multiobjective min-cuts for a fixed budget-vector \(b\in {\mathbb {R}}^t_{\ge 0}\) is \(O(n^2)\).


3.
We show that min-k-cut in hypergraphs subject to constant lower bounds on part sizes is solvable in polynomial-time for constant k, thus resolving an open problem posed by Guinez and Queyranne (Unpublished manuscript. . See also , 2012). Our technique also shows that the number of optimal solutions is polynomial.

 All of our results build on the random contraction approach of Karger (Proceedings of the 4th annual ACM-SIAM symposium on discrete algorithms, SODA, pp 21–30, 1993). Our techniques illustrate the versatility of the random contraction approach to address counting and algorithmic problems concerning multiobjective min-cuts and size-constrained k-cuts in hypergraphs.","Calvin Beideman1, Karthekeyan Chandrasekaran

In this article, we give the following answer for a 2-color scenery and simple random walk with holding: We prove that a piece of the scenery of length of the order 3n around the origin can be reconstructed – up to a reflection and a small translation – with high probability from the first 2 · 310
αn observations with a constant α > 0 independent of n. Thus, the number of observations needed is polynomial in the length of the piece of scenery which we reconstruct. The probability that the reconstruction fails tends to 0 as n→∞.In contrast to [21], [22], and [20], the proofs in this article are all constructive. Our reconstruction algorithm is an algorithm in the sense of computer science. This is the first article which shows that the scenery reconstruction is also possible in the 2-color case with holding.

0,The Scaling Attractor and Ultimate Dynamics for Smoluchowski’s Coagulation Equations,"
We describe a basic framework for studying dynamic scaling that has roots in dynamical systems and probability theory. Within this framework, we study Smoluchowski’s coagulation equation for the three simplest rate kernels K(x,y)=2, x+y and xy. In another work, we classified all self-similar solutions and all universality classes (domains of attraction) for scaling limits under weak convergence (Menon and Pego in Commun. Pure Appl. Math.
57, 1197–1232, [2004]). Here we add to this a complete description of the set of all limit points of solutions modulo scaling (the scaling attractor) and the dynamics on this limit set (the ultimate dynamics). A key tool is Bertoin’s Lévy-Khintchine representation formula for eternal solutions of Smoluchowski’s equation (Bertoin in Ann. Appl. Probab.
12, 547–564, [2002a]). This representation linearizes the dynamics on the scaling attractor, revealing these dynamics to be conjugate to a continuous dilation, and chaotic in a classical sense. Furthermore, our study of scaling limits explains how Smoluchowski dynamics “compactifies” in a natural way that accounts for clusters of zero and infinite size (dust and gel).

0,Aggregating expert judgement,"In a paper written some 25 years ago, I distinguished three contexts in which one might wish to combine expert judgements of uncertainty: the expert problem, the group decision problem and the textbook problem. Over the intervening years much has been written on the first two, which have the focus of a single decision context, but little on the third, though the closely related field of meta-analysis has developed considerably. With many developments in internet technology, particularly in relation to interactivity and communication, the textbook problem is gaining in importance since data and expert judgements can be made available over the web to be used by many different individuals to shape their own beliefs in many different contexts. Moreover, applications such as web-based decision support, e-participation and e-democracy are making algorithmic ‘solutions’ to the group decision problem attractive, despite many results showing we know that such solutions are, at best, rare and, at worst, illusory. In this paper I survey developments since my earlier paper and note some unresolved issues. Then I turn to how expert judgement might be used within web-based group decision support, as well as in e-participation and e-democracy contexts. The latter points to a growing importance of the textbook problem and suggests that Cooke’s principles for scientific reporting of expert judgement studies may need enhancing for such studies to be used by a wider audience.",Simon French,"Revista de la Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas, Fisicas y Naturales.

Time-specific and subject-specific weights are incorporated into the formulation of weighted estimating equations. Unified results are established for estimating selection probabilities that cover both parametric and non-parametric modeling schemes. The resulting estimators have closed forms and are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Simulation studies indicate that the proposed estimators perform well for practical settings.

0,Stochastic quasi-gradient methods: variance reduction via Jacobian sketching,"We develop a new family of variance reduced stochastic gradient descent methods for minimizing the average of a very large number of smooth functions. Our method—JacSketch—is motivated by novel developments in randomized numerical linear algebra, and operates by maintaining a stochastic estimate of a Jacobian matrix composed of the gradients of individual functions. In each iteration, JacSketch efficiently updates the Jacobian matrix by first obtaining a random linear measurement of the true Jacobian through (cheap) sketching, and then projecting the previous estimate onto the solution space of a linear matrix equation whose solutions are consistent with the measurement. The Jacobian estimate is then used to compute a variance-reduced unbiased estimator of the gradient. Our strategy is analogous to the way quasi-Newton methods maintain an estimate of the Hessian, and hence our method can be seen as a stochastic quasi-gradient method. Our method can also be seen as stochastic gradient descent applied to a controlled stochastic optimization reformulation of the original problem, where the control comes from the Jacobian estimates. We prove that for smooth and strongly convex functions, JacSketch converges linearly with a meaningful rate dictated by a single convergence theorem which applies to general sketches. We also provide a refined convergence theorem which applies to a smaller class of sketches, featuring a novel proof technique based on a stochastic Lyapunov function. This enables us to obtain sharper complexity results for variants of JacSketch with importance sampling. By specializing our general approach to specific sketching strategies, JacSketch reduces to the celebrated stochastic average gradient (SAGA) method, and its several existing and many new minibatch, reduced memory, and importance sampling variants. Our rate for SAGA with importance sampling is the current best-known rate for this method, resolving a conjecture by Schmidt et al. (Proceedings of the eighteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, AISTATS 2015, San Diego, California, 2015). The rates we obtain for minibatch SAGA are also superior to existing rates and are sufficiently tight as to show a decrease in total complexity as the minibatch size increases. Moreover, we obtain the first minibatch SAGA method with importance sampling.","Robert M. Gower

0,A continuous time Markov chain model for the dynamics of bovine tuberculosis in humans and cattle,"Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a disease of major public health concern and economic importance. The disease affects the livelihood of rural livestock farmers, economies of developing countries, human and animal health. In this paper, both deterministic and continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) models are formulated and analyzed to study the dynamics of bovine tuberculosis in humans and cattle. The next generation matrix method is applied to compute the basic reproduction number \(\mathcal {R}_0\) for the deterministic model while the multitype branching process is applied to compute the stochastic threshold for CTMC model. The normalized forward sensitivity index method is used to compute sensitivity indices of model parameters with respect to basic reproduction number \(\mathcal {R}_0\). The results reveal that infection rate among cattle is the most positive sensitive parameter whereas cattle’s natural death is the most negative sensitive parameter. This suggests that more efforts should be directed at reducing number of infected cattle for possible control of the spread of bTB in human and cattle populations. Numerical simulations for the CTMC stochastic model using 10,000 sample paths is carried out to compute probabilities for disease extinction by varying initial values for infected classes. The results show that, the solutions of CTMC stochastic model are relatively close to the deterministic model solutions. The possibility of bTB extinction is high when it emanates from either humans or infectious dairy products or from a small number of M. bovis bacteria from the environment. However, the disease outbreak occurs when it emerges from infected cattle population. Moreover, the results show that if bTB emerges from infected humans, cattle, dairy product and environment at the same time, then there is disease outbreak. Thus, any intervention measure that targets on reducing number of infected cattle will have significant impact to contain bTB in human and cattle populations.","Mussa A. Stephano

0,Constrained Discounted Stochastic Games,"In this paper, we consider a large class of constrained non-cooperative stochastic Markov games with countable state spaces and discounted cost criteria. In one-player case, i.e., constrained discounted Markov decision models, it is possible to formulate a static optimisation problem whose solution determines a stationary optimal strategy (alias control or policy) in the dynamical infinite horizon model. This solution lies in the compact convex set of all occupation measures induced by strategies, defined on the set of state–action pairs. In case of n-person discounted games the occupation measures are induced by strategies of all players. Therefore, it is difficult to generalise the approach for constrained discounted Markov decision processes directly. It is not clear how to define the domain for the best-response correspondence whose fixed point induces a stationary equilibrium in the Markov game. This domain should be the Cartesian product of compact convex sets in a locally convex topological vector space. One of our main results shows how to overcome this difficulty and define a constrained non-cooperative static game whose Nash equilibrium induces a stationary Nash equilibrium in the Markov game. This is done for games with bounded cost functions and positive initial state distribution. An extension to a class of Markov games with unbounded costs and arbitrary initial state distribution relies on an approximation of the unbounded game by bounded ones with positive initial state distributions. In the unbounded case, we assume the uniform integrability of the discounted costs with respect to all probability measures induced by strategies of the players, defined on the space of plays (histories) of the game. Our assumptions are weaker than those applied in earlier works on discounted dynamic programming or stochastic games using the so-called weighted norm approach.","Anna Jaśkiewicz

0,Approximate Gradient Methods in Policy-Space Optimization of Markov Reward Processes,"We consider a discrete time, finite state Markov reward process that depends on a set of parameters. We start with a brief review of (stochastic) gradient descent methods that tune the parameters in order to optimize the average reward, using a single (possibly simulated) sample path of the process of interest. The resulting algorithms can be implemented online, and have the property that the gradient of the average reward converges to zero with probability 1. On the other hand, the updates can have a high variance, resulting in slow convergence. We address this issue and propose two approaches to reduce the variance. These approaches rely on approximate gradient formulas, which introduce an additional bias into the update direction. We derive bounds for the resulting bias terms and characterize the asymptotic behavior of the resulting algorithms. For one of the approaches considered, the magnitude of the bias term exhibits an interesting dependence on the time it takes for the rewards to reach steady-state. We also apply the methodology to Markov reward processes with a reward-free termination state, and an expected total reward criterion.

We then add a site-exclusion interaction, thus making the particle system a simple exclusion process. We show that, for almost all environments, under diffusive space–time rescaling the system exhibits a hydrodynamic limit in path space. The hydrodynamic equation is non-random and governed by the effective homogenized matrix D of the single random walk, which can be degenerate.

0,Understanding the topology and the geometry of the space of persistence diagrams via optimal partial transport,"Despite the obvious similarities between the metrics used in topological data analysis and those of optimal transport, an optimal-transport based formalism to study persistence diagrams and similar topological descriptors has yet to come. In this article, by considering the space of persistence diagrams as a space of discrete measures, and by observing that its metrics can be expressed as optimal partial transport problems, we introduce a generalization of persistence diagrams, namely Radon measures supported on the upper half plane. Such measures naturally appear in topological data analysis when considering continuous representations of persistence diagrams (e.g. persistence surfaces) but also as limits for laws of large numbers on persistence diagrams or as expectations of probability distributions on the space of persistence diagrams. We explore topological properties of this new space, which will also hold for the closed subspace of persistence diagrams. New results include a characterization of convergence with respect to Wasserstein metrics, a geometric description of barycenters (Fréchet means) for any distribution of diagrams, and an exhaustive description of continuous linear representations of persistence diagrams. We also showcase the strength of this framework to study random persistence diagrams by providing several statistical results made meaningful thanks to this new formalism.",Vincent Divol1 na1 & Théo Lacombe1 na,Journal of Applied and Computational Topology,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41468-020-00061-z,"Topological data analysis,Optimal transport,Statistics,Fréchet means"
0,A continuation approach to mode-finding of multivariate Gaussian mixtures and kernel density estimates,"Gaussian mixtures (i.e. linear combinations of multivariate Gaussian probability densities) appear in numerous applications due to their universal ability to approximate multimodal probability distributions. Finding the modes (maxima) of a Gaussian mixture is a fundamental problem arising in many practical applications such as machine learning and digital image processing. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient method for finding a significant mode of the Gaussian mixture. Such a mode represents an area of large probability, and it often coincides with the global mode of the mixture. The proposed method uses a Gaussian convolution in order to remove undesired local maxima of the Gaussian mixture and preserve its underlying structure. The transformation between the maximizers of the smoothed Gaussian mixture and the original one is formulated as a differential equation. A robust trust region method for tracing the solution curve of this differential equation is described. Our formulation also allows mixtures with negative weights or even negative values, which occur in some applications related to machine learning or quantum mechanics. The applicability of the method to mode-finding of Gaussian kernel density estimates obtained from experimental data is illustrated. Finally, some numerical results are given to demonstrate the ability of the method to find significant modes of Gaussian mixtures and kernel density estimates.","Seppo Pulkkinen1,2, Marko Mikael Mäkelä2 & Napsu Karmitsa",Journal of Global Optimization,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-011-9833-8,"Mode-finding,Gaussian mixture,Convolution,Continuation,Trust region,Predictor-corrector,Kernel density estimation"

0,Symmetric rearrangements around infinity with applications to Lévy processes,"We prove a new rearrangement inequality for multiple integrals, which partly generalizes a result of Friedberg and Luttinger (Arch Ration Mech 61:35–44, 1976) and can be interpreted as involving symmetric rearrangements of domains around \(\infty \). As applications, we prove two comparison results for general Lévy processes and their symmetric rearrangements. The first application concerns the survival probability of a point particle in a Poisson field of moving traps following independent Lévy motions. We show that the survival probability can only increase if the point particle does not move, and the traps and the Lévy motions are symmetrically rearranged. This essentially generalizes an isoperimetric inequality of Peres and Sousi (Geom Funct Anal 22(4):1000–1014, 2012) for the Wiener sausage. In the second application, we show that the \(q\)-capacity of a Borel measurable set for a Lévy process can only decrease if the set and the Lévy process are symmetrically rearranged. This result generalizes an inequality obtained by Watanabe (Z Wahrsch Verw Gebiete 63:487–499, 1983) for symmetric Lévy processes.","Alexander Drewitz1, Perla Sousi2 & Rongfeng Sun",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-013-0492-1,"Capacity,Isoperimetric inequality,Lévy process ,Lévy sausage,Pascal principle,Rearrangement inequality,Trapping dynamics"
0,Geometry of the random walk range conditioned on survival among Bernoulli obstacles,"We consider a discrete time simple symmetric random walk among Bernoulli obstacles on \({{\mathbb {Z}}}^d\), \(d\ge 2\), where the walk is killed when it hits an obstacle. It is known that conditioned on survival up to time N, the random walk range is asymptotically contained in a ball of radius \(\varrho _N=C N^{1/(d+2)}\) for any \(d\ge 2\). For \(d=2\), it is also known that the range asymptotically contains a ball of radius \((1-\epsilon )\varrho _N\) for any \(\epsilon >0\), while the case \(d\ge 3\) remains open. We complete the picture by showing that for any \(d\ge 2\), the random walk range asymptotically contains a ball of radius \(\varrho _N-\varrho _N^\epsilon \) for some \(\epsilon \in (0,1)\). Furthermore, we show that its boundary is of size at most \(\varrho _N^{d-1}(\log \varrho _N)^a\) for some \(a>0\).

0,Entropic dynamics: a hybrid-contextual model of quantum mechanics,"The Bell–Kochen–Specker (BKS) theorem and the more recent \(\psi \)-epistemic no-go theorems of Quantum Mechanics (QM) are discussed in the context of entropic dynamics. In doing so we find that the BKS theorem allows for, a perhaps overlooked, hybrid-contextual model of QM in which one set of commuting observables (position in this case) is non-contextual and all other observables are contextual. Entropic Dynamics is in a unique position as compared to other foundational theories of QM because it derives QM using standard techniques in Bayesian probability theory. In this formalism, position is the preferred basis from which inferences about other contextual operators are made. This leads to the interpretation that Entropic Dynamics is a hybrid-contextual model of QM, which we show to be consistent with the BKS theorem and QM.","Kevin Vanslette

0,Effective behavior of cooperative and nonidentical molecular motors,"Analytical formulas for effective drift, diffusivity, run times, and run lengths are derived for an intracellular transport system consisting of a cargo attached to two cooperative but not identical molecular motors (for example, kinesin-1 and kinesin-2) which can each attach and detach from a microtubule. The dynamics of the motor and cargo in each phase are governed by stochastic differential equations, and the switching rates depend on the spatial configuration of the motor and cargo. This system is analyzed in a limit where the detached motors have faster dynamics than the cargo, which in turn has faster dynamics than the attached motors. The attachment and detachment rates are also taken to be slow relative to the spatial dynamics. Through an application of iterated stochastic averaging to this system, and the use of renewal-reward theory to stitch together the progress within each switching phase, we obtain explicit analytical expressions for the effective drift, diffusivity, and processivity of the motor-cargo system. Our approach accounts in particular for jumps in motor-cargo position that occur during attachment and detachment events, as the cargo tracking variable makes a rapid adjustment due to the averaged fast scales. The asymptotic formulas are in generally good agreement with direct stochastic simulations of the detailed model based on experimental parameters for various pairings of kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 under assisting, hindering, or no load.","Joseph J.

0,Ex-Ante Welfare Superiority of the Boston Mechanism Over the Deferred Acceptance Mechanism,"We compare two widely used allocation methods for assigning students to schools—the deferred acceptance (DA) mechanism and the Boston mechanism—in terms of students’ welfare under a symmetric incomplete information setting in which each student’s school preferences are  privately known. We assume that each student’s type, which is the vector of cardinal values they derive from attending each school, is independently drawn, and each possible strict ranking of schools is equally likely for each student. Furthermore, all schools have an identical student priority order, which is unknown to students. When there are three schools with equal numbers of available seats, we analytically derive the probability difference between the Boston and DA mechanisms of obtaining the first, second, and third choices. Furthermore, we show that the Boston mechanism is ex-ante welfare superior to the DA mechanism under weak conditions on the distribution of valuations when each student’s value for each school is independently drawn from an identical distribution.","Ethem Akyol

0,Stochastic streamflow and dissolved silica dynamics with application to the worst-case long-run evaluation of water environment,"Management of river environment requires to assess streamflows and water quality dynamics, which are often stochastic as well as not easy to model without errors. A new mathematical framework is proposed in this paper to assess an environment in a long run based on a stochastic optimization theory under model ambiguity. Focusing on the dissolved silica (DSi) load as an environmental indicator of rivers, the coupled discharge and DSi load dynamics as a two-variable continuous-state branching process with immigration is formulated. The ambiguity as a model misspecification is evaluated by a relative entropy measuring deviation between benchmark and distorted models. The model misspecification is expressed as a bound of the relative entropy. Novel stochastic optimization problems are formulated to evaluate the long-run DSi load subject to the misspecification as expectation constraints. Nonlocal degenerate elliptic Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations having Lagrangian multipliers are employed to solve these problems and their optimality are verified theoretically. The HJB equations admit closed-form solutions that can be computed efficiently. Our model is finally applied to assessing long-run DSi load and discharge in an upstream Hiikawa River, Japan.","Hidekazu Yoshioka1,2 & Yumi Yoshioka",Optimization and Engineering,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-022-09743-2,"River discharge,Dissolved silica,Continuous-state branching processes with immigration,Stochastic optimization under ambiguity,Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations"

Optimality is meant in the sense of the maximization of an arbitrary preference model, e.g., expected utility theory or prospect theory. The proof is based on a result from transport theory. We apply the general result to specific situations, in particular the case of a market described by the Capital Asset Pricing Model or the Black–Scholes model, where we derive a generalization of the two-fund-separation theorem and give an extension to APT factor models and structured products with several underlyings. We use our results to derive a new approach to optimization in wealth management, based on a direct optimization of the return distribution of the portfolio. In particular, we show that optimal products can (essentially) be written as monotonic functions of the market return. We provide existence and nonexistence results for optimal products in this framework.

Smooth formulations of the problem often exhibit an undesirable phenomenon: the condition number, classically defined, scales poorly with the dimension of the ambient space. In contrast, we here show that in a variety of concrete circumstances, nonsmooth penalty formulations do not suffer from the same type of ill-conditioning. Consequently, standard algorithms for nonsmooth optimization, such as subgradient and prox-linear methods, converge at a rapid dimension-independent rate when initialized within constant relative error of the solution. Moreover, nonsmooth formulations are naturally robust against outliers.

0,"Efficient, certifiably optimal clustering with applications to latent variable graphical models","Motivated by the task of clustering either d variables or d points into K groups, we investigate efficient algorithms to solve the Peng–Wei (P–W) K-means semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation. The P–W SDP has been shown in the literature to have good statistical properties in a variety of settings, but remains intractable to solve in practice. To this end we propose FORCE, a new algorithm to solve this SDP relaxation. Compared to off-the-shelf interior point solvers, our method reduces the computational complexity of solving the SDP from \({\widetilde{{\mathcal {O}}}}(d^7\log \epsilon ^{-1})\) to \({\widetilde{{\mathcal {O}}}}(d^{6}K^{-2}\epsilon ^{-1})\) arithmetic operations for an \(\epsilon \)-optimal solution. Our method combines a primal first-order method with a dual optimality certificate search, which when successful, allows for early termination of the primal method. We show for certain variable clustering problems that, with high probability, FORCE is guaranteed to find the optimal solution to the SDP relaxation and provide a certificate of exact optimality. As verified by our numerical experiments, this allows FORCE to solve the P–W SDP with dimensions in the hundreds in only tens of seconds. For a variation of the P–W SDP where K is not known a priori a slight modification of FORCE reduces the computational complexity of solving this problem as well: from \({\widetilde{{\mathcal {O}}}}(d^7\log \epsilon ^{-1})\) using a standard SDP solver to \({\widetilde{{\mathcal {O}}}}(d^{4}\epsilon ^{-1})\).","Carson Eisenach

0,Enrichment analysis applied to disease prognosis,"AbstractEnrichment analysis is well established in the field of transcriptomics, where it is used to identify relevant biological features that characterize a set of genes obtained in an experiment.This article proposes the application of enrichment analysis as a first step in a disease prognosis methodology, in particular of diseases with a strong genetic component. With this analysis the objective is to identify clinical and biological features that characterize groups of patients with a common disease, and that can be used to distinguish between groups of patients associated with disease-related events. Data mining methodologies can then be used to exploit those features, and assist medical doctors in the evaluation of the patients in respect to their predisposition for a specific event.In this work the disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is used as a case-study, as a first test to assess the feasibility of the application of an enrichment analysis to disease prognosis. To perform this assessment, two groups of patients have been considered: patients that have suffered a sudden cardiac death episode and patients that have not.The results presented were obtained with genetic data and the Gene Ontology, in two enrichment analyses: an enrichment profiling aiming at characterizing a group of patients (e.g. that suffered a disease-related event) based on their mutations; and a differential enrichment aiming at identifying differentiating features between a sub-group of patients and all the patients with the disease. These analyses correspond to an adaptation of the standard enrichment analysis, since multiple sets of genes are being considered, one for each patient.The preliminary results are promising, as the sets of terms obtained reflect the current knowledge about the gene functions commonly altered in HCM patients, thus allowing their characterization. Nevertheless, some factors need to be taken into consideration before the full potential of the enrichment analysis in the prognosis methodology can be evaluated. One of such factors is the need to test the enrichment analysis with clinical data, in addition to genetic data, since both types of data are expected to be necessary for prognosis purposes.","Catia M Machado1,2, Ana T Freitas2 & Francisco M Couto",Journal of Biomedical Semantics,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2041-1480-4-21,"Gene Ontology,Sudden Cardiac Death,Enrichment Analysis,Distinct Gene,Semantic Similarity Measure"

An application to the shortest queue problem is shown. By exploiting the functional formulation given in terms of generating functions, we devise a weakly numerically stable algorithm for computing the probability invariant vector π. The algorithm is divided into three stages. At the first stage the zeros of a complex function are numerically computed by means of an extension of the Aberth method. At the second stage the first k components of π are computed by solving an interpolation problem, where k is a suitable constant associated with the matrix. Finally, at the third stage a triangular Toeplitz system is solved and its solution is refined by applying the power method or any other refinement method based on regular splittings. In the solution of the triangular Toeplitz system and at each step of the refinement method, special FFT-based techniques are applied in order to keep the arithmetic cost within the O(n log n) bound, where n is an upper bound to the number of the computed components.

A random sequence described by a stationary probability measure must have almost surely convergent time averages whenever it has almost surely bounded time averages. Hence, no measure can provide the mathematical model we desire. In turning to lower probability based models we first explore the relationships between divergence, stationarity, and monotone continuity and those between monotone continuity and unicity of extensions. We then construct several examples of stationary lower probabilities for sequences of uniformly bounded random variables such that divergence of time averages occurs with lower probability one. We conclude with some remarks on the problem of estimating lower probability models on the basis of cylinder set observations.","Anurag Kumar1,2 & Terrence L.

First, orthogonal arrays are constructed by mutually orthogonal Latin squares. Then, the orthogonal array is used to establish the mapping between authentication tag and the message set, and a non-splitting Cartesian authentication code and a splitting authentication code are constructed. Furthermore, the coding matrix of the non-splitting Cartesian authentication code is used to establish a connection with the Latin square, and a security authentication code is constructed. These construction methods are of universal significance. The probability of successful impersonation attack and substitution attack of these codes, various distribution probabilities, and information entropy are calculated. Finally, the performance of these authentication codes is analyzed, and it is verified that the constructed codes are perfect and optimal.","Xiuli Wang

0,"Transient Analysis of \(M^{[X_{1}]},M^{[X_{2}]}/G_{1},G_{2}/1\) Retrial Queueing System with Priority Services, Working Vacations and Vacation Interruption, Emergency Vacation, Negative Arrival and Delayed Repair","This paper deals with the analysis of two classes of batch arrivals, one is high priority and other is low priority(retrial) customers with non-preemptive priority service, working vacations, negative arrival, emergency vacation for an unreliable server, which consists of a break-down by negative arrival and delay time to start repair. When there are no customers in the queue and in the orbit at the time of service completion for a positive customers, the server goes for a working vacation. The server works at a lower service rate during working vacation period. If there are no customers in the system at the end of vacation, the server becomes idle and ready for serving the new arrivals with probability p(single working vacation) or it remains on vacation with probability \(q=(1{-}p)\) (multiple working vacations). Here we assume that customers arrive according to compound Poisson process in which high priority customers are assigned to class one and class two customers are of a low priority type. The priority customers that find the server busy are queued and then served in accordance with FCFS discipline. The arriving low priority customers on finding the server busy are queued in the orbit in accordance with FCFS constant retrial policy. The arrival of negative customer remove the customer being in service and makes the server breakdown and the server fail for a short interval of time. When the server fails it will send to repair. But the repair time do not start immediately, there is a delay time to start the repair process. We consider an emergency vacation which means that during the service time the server suddenly go for a vacation and the interrupted customer waits to getting the remaining service. The retrial time, service time, emergency vacation time, delay time and repair time are all follows general(arbitrary) distribution, working vacation time and negative arrival follows exponential distribution. The time dependent probability generating functions have been obtained in terms of their Laplace transforms and the corresponding steady state results are obtained explicitly. Also some performance measures of our model such as the system state probabilities, reliability indices, the average number of customer in the high priority queue and the low priority in the orbit and the average waiting time are derived.

0,Cellular adaptive Petri net based on learning automata and its application to the vertex coloring problem,"In a Petri net, a decision point is raised when two or more transitions are simultaneously enabled in a given marking. The decision to be made at such a point is the selection of an enabled transition for firing. Decision making in Petri nets is accomplished by a so called controlling mechanism. Whenever a Petri net is used to represent an algorithm, the application of a different controlling mechanism results in a different instance of that algorithm. Recently, an adaptive controlling mechanism has been introduced for Petri nets in which several learning automata are used as decision makers during the evolution of the Petri nets. A Petri net with this adaptive controlling mechanism is referred to as APN-LA. Using APN-LA, one may be able to design adaptive algorithms to solve problems. There are problems for which designing a single APN-LA is tedious and results in a large and complex model. One class of such problems is the cellular problem, in which an identical algorithm must be executed in each cell and the solution to the problem is generated from the cooperation of these identical algorithms. To avoid having large and complex APN-LAs for cellular problems, a cellular adaptive Petri net called CAPN-LA is proposed in this paper, which consists of a cellular structure and a number of identical APN-LAs. In CAPN-LA, each APN-LA represents the algorithm which must be executed in each cell, and the required cooperation between the neighboring cells is handled by means of cooperation between the APN-LAs in those cells. The notation of expediency for this model is defined, and, using the steady-state analysis of the behavior of the CAPN-LA model, conditions under which this model is expedient are stated. A measure of expediency is defined for comparing different CAPN-LAs according to their expected reward; a CAPN-LA which receives a higher expected reward is regarded as more expedient. The proposed CAPN-LA is then used to design different algorithms for the classic problem of vertex coloring. The measure of expediency is calculated for these algorithms and results of using them for coloring vertices of different graphs are also included.","S. Mehdi Vahidipour

0,Measuring resetting of brain dynamics at epileptic seizures: application of global optimization and spatial synchronization techniques,"Epileptic seizures are manifestations of intermittent spatiotemporal transitions of the human brain from chaos to order. Measures of chaos, namely maximum Lyapunov exponents (STL

max
), from dynamical analysis of the electroencephalograms (EEGs) at critical sites of the epileptic brain, progressively converge (diverge) before (after) epileptic seizures, a phenomenon that has been called dynamical synchronization (desynchronization). This dynamical synchronization/desynchronization has already constituted the basis for the design and development of systems for long-term (tens of minutes), on-line, prospective prediction of epileptic seizures. Also, the criterion for the changes in the time constants of the observed synchronization/desynchronization at seizure points has been used to show resetting of the epileptic brain in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a phenomenon that implicates a possible homeostatic role for the seizures themselves to restore normal brain activity. In this paper, we introduce a new criterion to measure this resetting that utilizes changes in the level of observed synchronization/desynchronization. We compare this criterion’s sensitivity of resetting with the old one based on the time constants of the observed synchronization/desynchronization. Next, we test the robustness of the resetting phenomena in terms of the utilized measures of EEG dynamics by a comparative study involving STL

max
, a measure of phase (φ

max
) and a measure of energy (E) using both criteria (i.e. the level and time constants of the observed synchronization/desynchronization). The measures are estimated from intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings with subdural and depth electrodes from two patients with focal temporal lobe epilepsy and a total of 43 seizures. Techniques from optimization theory, in particular quadratic bivalent programming, are applied to optimize the performance of the three measures in detecting preictal entrainment. It is shown that using either of the two resetting criteria, and for all three dynamical measures, dynamical resetting at seizures occurs with a significantly higher probability (α=0.05) than resetting at randomly selected non-seizure points in days of EEG recordings per patient. It is also shown that dynamical resetting at seizures using time constants of STL

max
 synchronization/desynchronization occurs with a higher probability than using the other synchronization measures, whereas dynamical resetting at seizures using the level of synchronization/desynchronization criterion is detected with similar probability using any of the three measures of synchronization. These findings show the robustness of seizure resetting with respect to measures of EEG dynamics and criteria of resetting utilized, and the critical role it might play in further elucidation of ictogenesis, as well as in the development of novel treatments for epilepsy.","Shivkumar Sabesan1, Niranjan Chakravarthy1, Kostas Tsakalis1, Panos Pardalos3 & …Leon Iasemidis",Journal of Combinatorial Optimization,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10878-008-9181-x,"Quadratic binary programming,Dynamical Synchronization,Spatiotemporal transitions,Epileptic seizure dynamics"

Schonmann and Shlosman showed that in the two dimensional case the relaxation time is a simple function of the energy required to create a critical Wulff droplet. The dilute Ising model is obtained from the regular Ising model by deleting a fraction of the edges of the underlying graph. In this paper we show that even an arbitrarily small dilution can dramatically reduce the relaxation time.

0,The frequency-dependent Wright–Fisher model: diffusive and non-diffusive approximations,"We study a class of processes that are akin to the Wright–Fisher model, with transition probabilities weighted in terms of the frequency-dependent fitness of the population types. By considering an approximate weak formulation of the discrete problem, we are able to derive a corresponding continuous weak formulation for the probability density. Therefore, we obtain a family of partial differential equations for the evolution of the probability density, and which will be an approximation of the discrete process in the joint large population, small time-steps and weak selection limit. If the fitness functions are sufficiently regular, we can recast the weak formulation in a more standard formulation, without any boundary conditions, but supplemented by a number of conservation laws. The equations in this family can be purely diffusive, purely hyperbolic or of convection–diffusion type, with frequency dependent convection. The particular outcome will depend on the assumed scalings. The diffusive equations are of the degenerate type; using a duality approach, we also obtain a frequency dependent version of the Kimura equation without any further assumptions. We also show that the convective approximation is related to the replicator dynamics and provide some estimate of how accurate is the convective approximation, with respect to the convective-diffusion approximation. In particular, we show that the mode, but not the expected value, of the probability distribution is modelled by the replicator dynamics.

0,Polymer dynamics in the depinned phase: metastability with logarithmic barriers,"We consider the stochastic evolution of a (1 + 1)-dimensional polymer in the depinned regime. At equilibrium the system exhibits a double well structure: the polymer lies (essentially) either above or below the repulsive line. As a consequence, one expects a metastable behavior with rare jumps between the two phases combined with a fast thermalization inside each phase. However, the energy barrier between these two phases is only logarithmic in the system size L and therefore the two relevant time scales are only polynomial in L with no clear-cut separation between them. The whole evolution is governed by a subtle competition between the diffusive behavior inside one phase and the jumps across the energy barriers. Our main results are: (i) a proof that the mixing time of the system lies between \({L^{\frac 5 2}}\) and \({L^{\frac 5 2 +2}}\) ; (ii) the identification of two regions associated with the positive and negative phase of the polymer together with the proof of the asymptotic exponentiality of the tunneling time between them with rate equal to a half of the spectral gap.","Pietro Caputo1, Hubert Lacoin1, Fabio Martinelli1, François Simenhaus1 & …Fabio Lucio Toninelli",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-011-0355-6,"Reversible Markov chains,Polymer pinning model,Metastability,Spectral gap,Mixing time,Coupling,Quasi-stationary distribution"

In this context, scenario optimization is a well recognized methodology where a sample of the constraints is used to describe uncertainty. One says that the scenario solution generalizes well, or has a high robustness level, if it satisfies most of the other constraints besides those in the sample. Over the past 10 years, the main theoretical investigations on the scenario approach have related the robustness level of the scenario solution to the number of optimization variables. This paper breaks into the new paradigm that the robustness level is a-posteriori evaluated after the solution is computed and the actual number of the so-called support constraints is assessed (wait-and-judge). A new theory is presented which shows that a-posteriori observing k support constraints in dimension \(d > k\) allows one to draw conclusions close to those obtainable when the problem is from the outset in dimension k.

0,Stationary distribution and cover time of sparse directed configuration models,"We consider sparse digraphs generated by the configuration model with given in-degree and out-degree sequences. We establish that with high probability the cover time is linear up to a poly-logarithmic correction. For a large class of degree sequences we determine the exponent \(\gamma \ge 1\) of the logarithm and show that the cover time grows as \(n\log ^{\gamma }(n)\), where n is the number of vertices. The results are obtained by analysing the extremal values of the stationary distribution of the digraph. In particular, we show that the stationary distribution \(\pi \) is uniform up to a poly-logarithmic factor, and that for a large class of degree sequences the minimal values of \(\pi \) have the form \(\frac{1}{n}\log ^{1-\gamma }(n)\), while the maximal values of \(\pi \) behave as \(\frac{1}{n}\log ^{1-\kappa }(n)\) for some other exponent \(\kappa \in [0,1]\). In passing, we prove tight bounds on the diameter of the digraphs and show that the latter coincides with the typical distance between two vertices.

The proposed statements of mixed robustness problems can be viewed as intermediate versions

scenario approach can be applied to robust systems; however, these tests can be computationally
costly. A simple graph-analytical approach based on robust \(D \)-decomposition (robust \(D \)-partition) is proposed to calculate the desired
stability probability. This method is suitable for the case of a small number of random parameters.
The final stability probability estimate is calculated in a deterministic way and can be found with
arbitrary precision. Approximate methods for solving the above problems are described. Examples

0,Optimal dynamic multi-attribute hashing for range queries,"This paper examines a partial match retrieval scheme which supports range queries for highly dynamic databases. The scheme relies on order preserving multi-attribute hashing. In general, designing optimal indexes is NP-hard. Greedy algorithms used to determine the optimal indexes for simple partial match queries are not directly applicable because there are a larger number of queries to consider in determining the optimal indexes. In this paper we present heuristic algorithms which provide near-optimal solutions. The optimisation scheme we propose can be used to design other dynamic file structures such as the grid file, BANG file and multilevel grid file to further enhance their retrieval performance taking into consideration the query distribution.",Evan P.

In the paper the complete algorithm is applied first in an integration procedure in a study of the perforated convex domains, i.e convex domains containing a finite array of non-overlapping convex holes. The second application is in the study of random colorings of the plane that are Euclidean motions invariant in distribution, basing on the theory of random polygonal windows from the so-called Independent Angles (IA) class. The method is a direct averaging of the complete combinatorial decompositions written for colorings observed in polygonal windows from the IA class. The approach seems to be quite general, but promises to be especially effective for the random coloring generated by random Poisson polygon process governed by the Haar measure on the group of Euclidean motions of the plane, assuming that a point P ∈ ℝ2 is colored J if P is covered by exactly J polygons of the Poisson process.

0,Analysing grouping of nucleotides in DNA sequences using lumped processes constructed from Markov chains,"The most commonly used models for analysing local dependencies in DNA sequences are (high-order) Markov chains. Incorporating knowledge relative to the possible grouping of the nucleotides enables to define dedicated sub-classes of Markov chains. The problem of formulating lumpability hypotheses for a Markov chain is therefore addressed. In the classical approach to lumpability, this problem can be formulated as the determination of an appropriate state space (smaller than the original state space) such that the lumped chain defined on this state space retains the Markov property. We propose a different perspective on lumpability where the state space is fixed and the partitioning of this state space is represented by a one-to-many probabilistic function within a two-level stochastic process. Three nested classes of lumped processes can be defined in this way as sub-classes of first-order Markov chains. These lumped processes enable parsimonious reparameterizations of Markov chains that help to reveal relevant partitions of the state space. Characterizations of the lumped processes on the original transition probability matrix are derived. Different model selection methods relying either on hypothesis testing or on penalized log-likelihood criteria are presented as well as extensions to lumped processes constructed from high-order Markov chains. The relevance of the proposed approach to lumpability is illustrated by the analysis of DNA sequences. In particular, the use of lumped processes enables to highlight differences between intronic sequences and gene untranslated region sequences.","Yann Guédon1, Yves d'Aubenton-Carafa2 & Claude Thermes",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-005-0358-y,"DNA sequence,Lumpability,Markov chain,Model selection"
0,Computational tools for assessing gene therapy under branching process models of mutation,"Multitype branching processes are ideal for studying the population dynamics of stem cell populations undergoing mutation accumulation over the years following transplant. In such stochastic models, several quantities are of clinical interest as insertional mutagenesis carries the potential threat of leukemogenesis following gene therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation. In this paper, we develop a three-type branching process model describing accumulations of mutations in a population of stem cells distinguished by their ability for long-term self-renewal. Our outcome of interest is the appearance of a double-mutant cell, which carries a high potential for leukemic transformation. In our model, a single-hit mutation carries a slight proliferative advantage over a wild-type stem cells. We compute marginalized transition probabilities that allow us to capture important quantitative aspects of our model, including the probability of observing a double-hit mutant and relevant moments of a single-hit mutation population over time. We thoroughly explore the model behavior numerically, varying birth rates across the initial sizes and populations of wild type stem cells and single-hit mutants, and compare the probability of observing a double-hit mutant under these conditions. We find that increasing the number of single-mutants over wild-type particles initially present has a large effect on the occurrence of a double-mutant, and that it is relatively safe for single-mutants to be quite proliferative, provided the lentiviral gene addition avoids creating single mutants in the original insertion process. Our approach is broadly applicable to an important set of questions in cancer modeling and other population processes involving multiple stages, compartments, or types.","Timothy C. Stutz1, Janet S.

0,Evolutionary trees and the Ising model on the Bethe lattice: a proof of Steel’s conjecture,"A major task of evolutionary biology is the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees from molecular data. The evolutionary model is given by a Markov chain on a tree. Given samples from the leaves of the Markov chain, the goal is to reconstruct the leaf-labelled tree. It is well known that in order to reconstruct a tree on n leaves, sample sequences of length Ω(log n) are needed. It was conjectured by Steel that for the CFN/Ising evolutionary model, if the mutation probability on all edges of the tree is less than \({p^{\ast} = (\sqrt{2}-1)/2^{3/2}}\), then the tree can be recovered from sequences of length O(log n). The value p* is given by the transition point for the extremality of the free Gibbs measure for the Ising model on the binary tree. Steel’s conjecture was proven by the second author in the special case where the tree is “balanced.” The second author also proved that if all edges have mutation probability larger than p* then the length needed is n
Ω(1). Here we show that Steel’s conjecture holds true for general trees by giving a reconstruction algorithm that recovers the tree from O(log n)-length sequences when the mutation probabilities are discretized and less than p*. Our proof and results demonstrate that extremality of the free Gibbs measure on the infinite binary tree, which has been studied before in probability, statistical physics and computer science, determines how distinguishable are Gibbs measures on finite binary trees.","Constantinos Daskalakis1, Elchanan Mossel2,3 & Sébastien Roch",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-009-0246-2,"Phylogenetics,CFN model,Ising model,Phase transitions,Reconstruction problem,Jukes–Cantor"
0,Mathematical and Simulation-Based Analysis of the Behavior of Admixed Taxa in the Neighbor-Joining Algorithm,"The neighbor-joining algorithm for phylogenetic inference (NJ) has been seen to have three specific properties when applied to distance matrices that contain an admixed taxon: (1) antecedence of clustering, in which the admixed taxon agglomerates with one of its source taxa before the two source taxa agglomerate with each other; (2) intermediacy of distances, in which the distance on an inferred NJ tree between an admixed taxon and either of its source taxa is smaller than the distance between the two source taxa; and (3) intermediacy of path lengths, in which the number of edges separating the admixed taxon and either of its source taxa is less than or equal to the number of edges between the source taxa. We examine the behavior of neighbor-joining on distance matrices containing an admixed group, investigating the occurrence of antecedence of clustering, intermediacy of distances, and intermediacy of path lengths. We first mathematically predict the frequency with which the properties are satisfied for a labeled unrooted binary tree selected uniformly at random in the absence of admixture. We then introduce a taxon constructed by a linear admixture of distances from two source taxa, examining three admixture scenarios by simulation: a model in which distance matrices are chosen at random, a model in which an admixed taxon is added to a set of taxa that reflect treelike evolution, and a model that introduces a perturbation of the treelike scenario. In contrast to previous conjectures, we observe that the three properties are sometimes violated by distance matrices that include an admixed taxon. However, we also find that they are satisfied more often than is expected by chance when the distance matrix contains an admixed taxon, especially when evolution among the non-admixed taxa is treelike. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of the nature of evolutionary trees constructed from data that do not necessarily reflect a treelike evolutionary process.","Jaehee Kim

It relies upon testing of pairs of hypotheses in the case where each hypothesis states that the vector of parameters underlying the distribution of observations belongs to a convex set. The nearly optimal under appropriate conditions test is yielded by a solution to an efficiently solvable convex optimization problem.

0,Advanced response surface method for mechanical reliability analysis,"Based on the classical response surface method (RSM), a novel RSM using improved experimental points (EPs) is presented for reliability analysis. Two novel points are included in the presented method. One is the use of linear interpolation, from which the total EPs for determining the RS are selected to be closer to the actual failure surface; the other is the application of sequential linear interpolation to control the distance between the surrounding EPs and the center EP, by which the presented method can ensure that the RS fits the actual failure surface in the region of maximum likelihood as the center EPs converge to the actual most probable point (MPP). Since the fitting precision of the RS to the actual failure surface in the vicinity of the MPP, which has significant contribution to the probability of the failure surface being exceeded, is increased by the presented method, the precision of the failure probability calculated by RS is increased as well. Numerical examples illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the presented method.","Lü Zhen-zhou

0,Stopping Time Convergence for Processes Associated with Dirichlet Forms,"Convergence is proved for solutions un of Dirichlet problems in regions with many small excluded sets (holes), as the holes become smaller and more numerous. The problem is formulated probabilistically in the context of general Dirichlet forms, for random and nonrandom excluded sets. Sufficient conditions are given in Theorem 2.1 under which the sequence of entrance times or hitting times of the excluded sets converges in the stable topology. Convergence in the stable topology is a strengthened form of convergence in distribution, introduced by Rényi. Stable convergence of the entrance times implies convergence of the solutions un of the corresponding Dirichlet problems. Theorem 2.1 applies to Dirichlet forms such that the Markov process associated with the form has continuous paths and satisfies an absolute continuity condition for occupation time measures (Eq. 2.4). Conditions for convergence are formulated in terms of the sum of the expectations of the equilibrium measures for the excluded sets. The proof of convergence uses the fact that any martingale with respect to the natural filtration of the process must be continuous. In the case that the excluded sets are iid random, Theorem 2.1 strengthens previous results for the classical Brownian motion setting.","J. R. Baxter

0,Prospective strict no-arbitrage and the fundamental theorem of asset pricing under transaction costs,"In discrete-time markets with proportional transaction costs, Schachermayer (Math. Financ. 14:19–48, 2004) showed that robust no-arbitrage is equivalent to the existence of a strictly consistent price system. In this paper, we introduce the concept of prospective strict no-arbitrage that is a variant of the strict no-arbitrage property from Kabanov et al. (Finance Stoch. 6:371–382, 2002). The prospective strict no-arbitrage condition is slightly weaker than the robust no-arbitrage condition, and it implies that the set of portfolios attainable from zero initial endowment is closed in probability. A weak version of prospective strict no-arbitrage turns out to be equivalent to the existence of a consistent price system. In contrast to the fundamental theorem of asset pricing of Schachermayer (Math. Financ. 14:19–48, 2004), the consistent frictionless prices may lie on the boundary of the bid–ask spread. On the technical level, a crucial difference to Schachermayer (Math. Financ. 14:19–48, 2004) and Kabanov et al.

0,On classical systems and measurements in quantum mechanics,"The recent rigorous derivation of the Born rule from the dynamical law of quantum mechanics Allahverdyan et al. (Phys Rep 525:1–166. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2012.11.001, 2013) is taken as incentive to reexamine whether quantum mechanics has to be an inherently probabilistic theory. It is shown, as an existence proof, that an alternative perspective on quantum mechanics is possible where the fundamental ontological element, the ket, is not probabilistic in nature and in which the Born rule can also be derived from the dynamics. The probabilistic phenomenology of quantum mechanics follows from a new definition of statistical state in the form of a probability measure on the Hilbert space of kets that is a replacement for the von Neumann statistical operator to address the lack of uniqueness in recovering the pure states included in mixed states, as was pointed out by Schrödinger. From the statistical state of a quantum system, classical variables are defined as collective variables with negligible dispersion. In this framework, classical variables can be chosen to define a derived classical system that obeys, by Ehrenfest’s theorem, the laws of classical mechanics and that describes the macroscopic behavior of the quantum system. The Born rule is derived from the dynamics of the statistical state of the quantum system composed of the observed system interacting with the measurement system and the role of the derived classical system in the process is exhibited. The approach suggests to formulate physical systems in second quantization in terms of local quantum fields to ensure conceptually equivalent treatment of space and time. A real double-slit experiment, as opposed to a thought experiment, is studied in detail to illustrate the measurement process.","Erik Deumens

0,Analysis of a stochastic predator–prey model with applications to intrahost HIV genetic diversity,"During an infection, HIV experiences strong selection by immune system T cells. Recent experimental work has shown that MHC escape mutations form an important pathway for HIV to avoid such selection. In this paper, we study a model of MHC escape mutation. The model is a predator–prey model with two prey, composed of two HIV variants, and one predator, the immune system CD8 cells. We assume that one HIV variant is visible to CD8 cells and one is not. The model takes the form of a system of stochastic differential equations. Motivated by well-known results concerning the short life-cycle of HIV intrahost, we assume that HIV population dynamics occur on a faster time scale then CD8 population dynamics. This separation of time scales allows us to analyze our model using an asymptotic approach. Using this model we study the impact of an MHC escape mutation on the population dynamics and genetic evolution of the intrahost HIV population. From the perspective of population dynamics, we show that the competition between the visible and invisible HIV variants can reach steady states in which either a single variant exists or in which coexistence occurs depending on the parameter regime. We show that in some parameter regimes the end state of the system is stochastic. From a genetics perspective, we study the impact of the population dynamics on the lineages of an HIV sample taken after an escape mutation occurs. We show that the lineages go through severe bottlenecks and that in certain parameter regimes the lineage distribution can be characterized by a Kingman coalescent.

We show that the dynamics, the minimal values of the cost functional, and the optimal control obtained with the proposed randomized time-splitting method converge in expectation to their analogues in the original problem when the time grid is refined. The derived convergence rates are validated in several numerical experiments.

0,On when to stop sampling for the maximum,"Suppose a sequential sample is taken from an unknown discrete probability distribution on an unknown range of integers, in an effort to sample its maximum. A crucial issue is an appropriate stopping rude determining when to terminate the sampling process. We approach this problem from a Bayesian perspective, and derive stopping rules that minimize loss functions which assign a loss to the sample size and to the deviation between the maximum in the sample and the true (unknown) maximum. We will show that our rules offer an extremely simple approximate solution to the well-known problem to terminate the Multistart method for continuous global optimization.",C. G. E. Boender1 & A. H.

0,Linear phase transition in random linear constraint satisfaction problems,"Our model is a generalized linear programming relaxation of a much studied random K-SAT problem. Specifically, a set of linear constraints  on K variables is fixed. From a pool of n variables, K variables are chosen uniformly at random and a constraint is chosen from  also uniformly at random. This procedure is repeated m times independently. We are interested in whether the resulting linear programming problem is feasible. We prove that the feasibility property experiences a linear phase transition, when n→∞ and m = cn for a constant c. Namely, there exists a critical value c
* such that, when c < c
*, the problem is feasible or is asymptotically almost feasible, as n→∞, but, when c>c
*, the ‘‘distance’’ to feasibility is at least a positive constant independent of n. Our result is obtained using the combination of a powerful local weak convergence method developed in Aldous [Ald92], [Ald01], Aldous and Steele [AS03], Steele [Ste02] and martingale techniques. By exploiting a linear programming duality, our theorem implies the following result in the context of sparse random graphs G(n, cn) on n nodes with cn edges, where edges are equipped with randomly generated weights. Let ℳ(n, c) denote maximum weight matching in G(n, cn). We prove that when c is a constant and n → ∞, the limit lim

0,A delay equation model for oviposition habitat selection by mosquitoes,"We propose a patch type model for mosquitoes that have aquatic larvae inhabiting ponds. Partial differential equations (PDEs) model the larvae on each of several disconnected patches representing the ponds, with conditions varying in each patch, coupled via the adults in the air. From the PDEs a scalar delay differential equation, with multiple delays, for the total adult mosquito population is derived. The various delays represent the larval development times in the patches. The coefficients contain all the relevant information about the sizes and geometry of the individual patches inhabited by the larvae, the boundary conditions applicable to those patches and the diffusivity of the larvae in each patch. For patches of general shapes and sizes, and without the need to specify the criteria by which an adult mosquito selects an oviposition patch, the modern theory of monotone dynamical systems and persistence theory enables a complete determination of the conditions for the mosquito population to go extinct or to persist. More detailed biological insights are obtained for the case when the patches are squares of various sizes, which allows a detailed discussion of the effects of scale, and for two particular criteria by which mosquitoes might select patches for oviposition, being (i) selection based solely on patch area, and (ii) selection based both on area and expected larval survival probability for each patch.

0,Direct search based on probabilistic feasible descent for bound and linearly constrained problems,"Direct search is a methodology for derivative-free optimization whose iterations are characterized by evaluating the objective function using a set of polling directions. In deterministic direct search applied to smooth objectives, these directions must somehow conform to the geometry of the feasible region, and typically consist of positive generators of approximate tangent cones (which then renders the corresponding methods globally convergent in the linearly constrained case). One knows however from the unconstrained case that randomly generating the polling directions leads to better complexity bounds as well as to gains in numerical efficiency, and it becomes then natural to consider random generation also in the presence of constraints. In this paper, we study a class of direct-search methods based on sufficient decrease for solving smooth linearly constrained problems where the polling directions are randomly generated (in approximate tangent cones). The random polling directions must satisfy probabilistic feasible descent, a concept which reduces to probabilistic descent in the absence of constraints. Such a property is instrumental in establishing almost-sure global convergence and worst-case complexity bounds with overwhelming probability. Numerical results show that the randomization of the polling directions can be beneficial over standard approaches with deterministic guarantees, as it is suggested by the respective worst-case complexity bounds.","S.

Visual tracking process is formulated as a combinatorial hypotheses search with a heuristic evaluation function taking into account structural and specific information such as distance, shape, color, etc.We introduce a Tabu Search algorithm which performs a search on an indirect space. A novel problem formulation allows us to transform any solution into the real search space, which is needed for fitness calculation, in linear time. This new formulation and the use of auxiliary structures yields a fast transformation from a blob-to-track assignment space to the real shape and position of tracks space (while calculating fitness in an incremental fashion), which is key in order to produce efficient and fast results. Other previous approaches are based on statistical techniques or on evolutionary algorithms.

0,A decision-making Fokker–Planck model in computational neuroscience,"In computational neuroscience, decision-making may be explained analyzing models based on the evolution of the average firing rates of two interacting neuron populations, e.g., in bistable visual perception problems. These models typically lead to a multi-stable scenario for the concerned dynamical systems. Nevertheless, noise is an important feature of the model taking into account both the finite-size effects and the decision’s robustness. These stochastic dynamical systems can be analyzed by studying carefully their associated Fokker–Planck partial differential equation. In particular, in the Fokker–Planck setting, we analytically discuss the asymptotic behavior for large times towards a unique probability distribution, and we propose a numerical scheme capturing this convergence. These simulations are used to validate deterministic moment methods recently applied to the stochastic differential system. Further, proving the existence, positivity and uniqueness of the probability density solution for the stationary equation, as well as for the time evolving problem, we show that this stabilization does happen. Finally, we discuss the convergence of the solution for large times to the stationary state.

In this paper, we perform asymptotic analysis on the DMD to prove strong consistency in the statistical sense. More specifically, we first give a statistical model of random noise for data with observation noise. Among many variants of the DMD, the total least squares DMD (TLS-DMD) is known as a robust method for the random noise in the observation. We focus on consistency analysis of the TLS-DMD in the statistical sense and aim to generalize the analysis for projected methods. This paper gives a general framework for designing projection methods based on efficient dimensionality reduction analogously to the proper orthogonal decomposition under the statistical model and proves its strong consistency of the estimation.","Kensuke Aishima

Popul. Biol. 63:309–338, 2003). Firstly, we show how the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics (Dieckmann and Law in J. Math. Biol. 34:579–612, 1996), an approximation for the rate of evolutionary change in characters under directional selection, can be extended so as to apply to general physiologically structured population models with multiple birth states. Secondly, we show that the invasion fitness function (up to and including second order terms, in the distances of the trait vectors to the singularity) for a community of N coexisting types near an evolutionarily singular point has a rational form, which is model-independent in the following sense: the form depends on the strategies of the residents and the invader, and on the second order partial derivatives of the one-resident fitness function at the singular point. This normal form holds for Lotka–Volterra models as well as for physiologically structured population models with multiple birth states, in discrete as well as continuous time and can thus be considered universal for the evolutionary dynamics in the neighbourhood of singular points. Only in the case of one-dimensional trait spaces or when N  =  1 can the normal form be reduced to a Taylor polynomial. Lastly we show, in the form of a stylized recipe, how these results can be combined into a systematic approach for the analysis of the (large) class of evolutionary models that satisfy the above restrictions.","Michel Durinx1, J.

0,Time reversal symmetry of generalized quantum measurements with past and future boundary conditions,"We expand the time reversal symmetry arguments of quantum mechanics, originally proposed by Wigner in the context of unitary dynamics, to contain situations including generalized measurements for monitored quantum systems. We propose a scheme to derive the time-reversed measurement operators by considering the Schrödinger picture dynamics of a qubit coupled to a measuring device, and show that the time-reversed measurement operators form a Positive Operator Valued Measure (POVM) set. We present three particular examples to illustrate time reversal of measurement operators: (1) the Gaussian spin measurement, (2) a dichotomous POVM for spin, and (3) the measurement of qubit fluorescence. We then propose a general rule to unravel any rank two qubit measurement, and show that the backward dynamics obeys the retrodicted equations of the forward dynamics starting from the time reversed final state. We demonstrate the time reversal invariance of dynamical equations using the example of qubit fluorescence. We also generalize the discussion of a statistical arrow of time for continuous quantum measurements introduced by Dressel et al. (Phys Rev Lett 119:220507, 2017): we show that the backward probabilities can be computed from a process similar to retrodiction from the time-reversed final state, and extend the definition of an arrow of time to ensembles prepared with pre- and post-selections, where we obtain a non-vanishing arrow of time in general. We discuss sufficient conditions for when time’s arrow vanishes and show our method also captures the contributions to time’s arrow due to natural physical processes like relaxation of an atom to its ground state. As a special case, we recover the time reversibility of the weak value as its complex conjugate using our method, and discuss how our conclusions differ from the time-symmetry argument of Aharonov–Bergmann–Lebowitz rule.","Sreenath K.

The users (players) are sending their requests to the system; then the system provides a random access with given probabilities to one of two free servers or to a single free server, or rejects the request. We study the following noncooperative game for this service system. As his strategy, each player chooses the time to send his request to the system, trying to maximize the probability of service. The symmetric Nash equilibrium is selected as the optimality criterion. Two models are considered for this game. In the first model, the number of players is deterministic, while in the second it obeys the Poisson distribution. We demonstrate that there exists a unique symmetric equilibrium for both models. Finally, some numerical experiments are performed (a) to compare the equilibria under different parameter values and (b) to compare the efficiency of this two-server system with the one-server counterpart and also with the corresponding pure random-access model in which the system has no information about the states of servers (busy or free).",Yu.V.

0,Sandwiching dense random regular graphs between binomial random graphs,"Kim and Vu made the following conjecture (Advances in Mathematics, 2004): if \(d\gg \log n\), then the random d-regular graph \({\mathscr {G}}(n,d)\) can asymptotically almost surely be “sandwiched” between \({\mathscr {G}}(n,p_1)\) and \({\mathscr {G}}(n,p_2)\) where \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) are both \((1+o(1))d/n\). They proved this conjecture for \(\log n\ll d\geqslant n^{1/3-o(1)}\), with a defect in the sandwiching: \({\mathscr {G}}(n,d)\) contains \({\mathscr {G}}(n,p_1)\) perfectly, but is not completely contained in \({\mathscr {G}}(n,p_2)\). The embedding \({\mathscr {G}}(n,p_1) \subseteq {\mathscr {G}}(n,d)\) was improved by Dudek, Frieze, Ruciński and Šileikis to \(d=o(n)\). In this paper, we prove Kim–Vu’s sandwich conjecture, with perfect containment on both sides, for all d where \(\min \{d, n-d\}\gg n/\sqrt{\log n}\). The sandwich theorem allows translation of many results from \({\mathscr {G}}(n,p)\) to \({\mathscr {G}}(n,d)\) such as Hamiltonicity, the chromatic number, the diameter, etc. It also allows translation of threshold functions of phase transitions from \({\mathscr {G}}(n,p)\) to bond percolation of \({\mathscr {G}}(n,d)\). In addition to sandwiching regular graphs, our results cover graphs whose degrees are asymptotically equal. The proofs rely on estimates for the probability of small subgraph appearances in a random factor of a pseudorandom graph, which is of independent interest.","Pu Gao1, Mikhail Isaev2 & Brendan D.

In addition, we further investigate its counterpart hyperbolic wavelet regression also based on least squares to recover non-periodic functions from random samples. Finally, we reconsider the analysis of a cubature method based on plain random points with optimal weights and reveal near-optimal worst-case error bounds with high probability.

As a result of our analysis, we are able to specify the smoothed complexity of classes of ILPs in terms of their worst case complexity.

We compute the local limits of uniform \(\rho \)-avoiding permutations, for \(|\rho |=3,\) when the size of the permutations tends to infinity. The core part of the argument is the description of the asymptotics of the number of consecutive occurrences of any given pattern.

0,Analysis of program logic test strategies,"


1.
The planning of program tests should be based on three principal criteria: structured coverage, the probability of residual error, and the probability of revealing a residual error.


2.
When basing planning on the first criterion one should consider that the complexity of testing structured graphs is independent of the method of coverage selection but entirely depends on the maximum rank (“height”) and cyclomatic number (“width”) of the graph. The reliability of testing nonstructured graphs is higher when more complex methods are applied for test route selection. When testing resources are limited it is desirable to use a method of covering all edges of the graph for which the complexity of testing is proportional to the width of the program graph.


3.
The strategy of ordering test routes by duration is preferable for testing with the purpose of minimizing the probability of the presence of a residual error; for narrow structured graphs this strategy also allows minimization of the probability of revealing a residual error. The strategy of ordering test routes by the probability of execution makes it possible more easily to obtain a program with a specified probability of revealing a residual error. With increasing nonstructurality and graph width the strategy becomes also preferable with respect to the criterion of the probability of a residual error.

0,Analysis of Artifacts in Shell-Based Image Inpainting: Why They Occur and How to Eliminate Them,"In this paper we study a class of fast geometric image inpainting methods based on the idea of filling the inpainting domain in successive shells from its boundary inwards. Image pixels are filled by assigning them a color equal to a weighted average of their already filled neighbors. However, there is flexibility in terms of the order in which pixels are filled, the weights used for averaging, and the neighborhood that is averaged over. Varying these degrees of freedom leads to different algorithms, and indeed the literature contains several methods falling into this general class. All of them are very fast, but at the same time all of them leave undesirable artifacts such as “kinking” (bending) or blurring of extrapolated isophotes. Our objective in this paper is to build a theoretical model in order to understand why these artifacts occur and what, if anything, can be done about them. Our model is based on two distinct limits: a continuum limit in which the pixel width \(h \rightarrow 0\) and an asymptotic limit in which \(h > 0\) but \(h \ll 1\). The former will allow us to explain “kinking” artifacts (and what to do about them) while the latter will allow us to understand blur. Both limits are derived based on a connection between the class of algorithms under consideration and stopped random walks. At the same time, we consider a semi-implicit extension in which pixels in a given shell are solved for simultaneously by solving a linear system. We prove (within the continuum limit) that this extension is able to completely eliminate kinking artifacts, which we also prove must always be present in the direct method. Finally, we show that although our results are derived in the context of inpainting, they are in fact abstract results that apply more generally. As an example, we show how our theory can also be applied to a problem in numerical linear algebra.

Based on the measurement dates, the probabilities of the consistent trajectories are evaluated and a state estimation is obtained as a consequence. From the set of possible current states and their probabilities, a method to evaluate the probability of future faults is developed using a probabilistic model. An example is presented to illustrate the results.","Rabah Ammour

The new facility location model has been proposed considering the proportional customer choice rule for customers with facilities within the attraction area and the binary rule—for customers which facilities are located outside the attraction area.

0,Deep Composition of Tensor-Trains Using Squared Inverse Rosenblatt Transports,"Characterising intractable high-dimensional random variables is one of the fundamental challenges in stochastic computation. The recent surge of transport maps offers a mathematical foundation and new insights for tackling this challenge by coupling intractable random variables with tractable reference random variables. This paper generalises the functional tensor-train approximation of the inverse Rosenblatt transport recently developed by Dolgov et al. (Stat Comput 30:603–625, 2020) to a wide class of high-dimensional non-negative functions, such as unnormalised probability density functions. First, we extend the inverse Rosenblatt transform to enable the transport to general reference measures other than the uniform measure. We develop an efficient procedure to compute this transport from a squared tensor-train decomposition which preserves the monotonicity. More crucially, we integrate the proposed order-preserving functional tensor-train transport into a nested variable transformation framework inspired by the layered structure of deep neural networks. The resulting deep inverse Rosenblatt transport significantly expands the capability of tensor approximations and transport maps to random variables with complicated nonlinear interactions and concentrated density functions. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach on a range of applications in statistical learning and uncertainty quantification, including parameter estimation for dynamical systems and inverse problems constrained by partial differential equations.","Tiangang Cui

0,"A network with tunable clustering, degree correlation and degree distribution, and an epidemic thereon","A random network model which allows for tunable, quite general forms of clustering, degree correlation and degree distribution is defined. The model is an extension of the configuration model, in which stubs (half-edges) are paired to form a network. Clustering is obtained by forming small completely connected subgroups, and positive (negative) degree correlation is obtained by connecting a fraction of the stubs with stubs of similar (dissimilar) degree. An SIR (Susceptible \(\rightarrow \) Infective \(\rightarrow \) Recovered) epidemic model is defined on this network. Asymptotic properties of both the network and the epidemic, as the population size tends to infinity, are derived: the degree distribution, degree correlation and clustering coefficient, as well as a reproduction number \(R_*\), the probability of a major outbreak and the relative size of such an outbreak. The theory is illustrated by Monte Carlo simulations and numerical examples. The main findings are that (1) clustering tends to decrease the spread of disease, (2) the effect of degree correlation is appreciably greater when the disease is close to threshold than when it is well above threshold and (3) disease spread broadly increases with degree correlation \(\rho \) when \(R_*\) is just above its threshold value of one and decreases with \(\rho \) when \(R_*\) is well above one.","Frank Ball1, Tom Britton2 & David Sirl",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-012-0609-7,"Branching process,Configuration model,Epidemic size, Random graph,SIR epidemic,Threshold behaviour"

This approach relies on a basic positive feedback mechanism that reinforces the ability of a given individual to win or to lose in a hierarchical interaction, depending on how many times it won or lost in previous interactions. Motivated by experiments carried out on primitively eusocial waspsPolistes, the model, is based on coupled differential equations supplemented with a small stochastic term. Numerical integrations allow many different hierarchical profiles to be obtained depending on the model parameters: (1) the particular form of the probability for an individual to win or lose a fight given its history, (2) the probability of interaction between two individuals, (3) the forgetting strength, which determines the rate at which events in the past are forgotten and no longer influence the force of an individual and (4) two individual recognition parameters, which set the contribution of individual recognition in the process of hierarchical genesis. We compare the results, expressed in terms of a hierarchical index or of the Landau number that describes the degree of linearity of the hierarchy, with various experimental results.","Eric Bonabeau1, Guy Theraulaz2 & Jean-Louis Deneubourg",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,1996,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02459478,"Dominance Hierarchy,Dominance Index,Individual Recognition,Dominance Order,Flat Profile"

However, several areas of investigation in population genetics theory, including the generalized neutrality theory, the concept of Muller's ratchet, and the risk of extinction of sexually reproducing populations due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations, rely on the calculation of the survival probability of selectively disadvantageous mutant genes. The calculation of these probabilities in the standard Wright-Fisher model of genetic evolution appears to be intractable, and yet is a key element in the above investigations. In this paper we find bounds for the fixation probability of deleterious and advantageous additive mutants, as well as finding close approximations for these probabilities.

0,Quantile hedging pension payoffs: an analysis of investment incentives,"Pension payoffs that depend on the term structure of interest rates can be superhedged by trading only in the bond market, albeit at a possibly high initial price. Quantile hedging techniques can be used to reduce the cost of the strategy if the investor is willing to accept the risk that, with low probability, the hedging portfolio will not be sufficient to cover the payoff. In this paper, we use results on partial hedging of defaultable claims to assess whether the cost of a quantile hedging strategy can be reduced by the addition of a risky asset to the bond market. In a simplified market model, we derive explicit expressions for the initial cost of the hedge and the expectation of the unhedged loss. We show that while investing in the risky asset reduces the cost of the hedge, it can significantly increase the risk linked to the unhedged loss. In the context of pension plan funding, we thus provide an example of the risky investment strategies encouraged by a partial hedge criterion based on the probability of loss.","Anne MacKay

","We show that if a language has an interactive proof of logarithmic statistical knowledge-complexity, then it belongs to the class . Thus, if the polynomial time hierarchy does not collapse, then -complete languages do not have logarithmic knowledge complexity. Prior to this work, there was no indication that would contradict  languages being proven with even one bit of knowledge. Our result is a common generalization of two previous results: The first asserts that statistical zero knowledge is contained in  [11, 2], while the second asserts that the languages recognizable in logarithmic statistical knowledge complexity are in  [19].Next, we consider the relation between the error probability and the knowledge complexity of an interactive proof. Note that reducing the error probability via repetition is not free: it may increase the knowledge complexity. We show that if the negligible error probability  is less than  (where k(n) is the knowledge complexity) then the language proven is in the third level of the polynomial time hierarchy (specifically, it is in ). In the standard setting of negligible error probability, there exist PSPACE-complete languages which have sub-linear knowledge complexity. However, if we insist, for example, that the error probability is less than , then PSPACE-complete languages do not have sub-quadratic knowledge complexity, unless .In order to prove our main result, we develop an AM protocol for checking that a samplable distribution D has a given entropy h.

0,Random Tight Frames,"We introduce probabilistic frames to study finite frames whose elements are chosen at random. While finite tight frames generalize orthonormal bases by allowing redundancy, independent, uniformly distributed points on the sphere approximately form a finite unit norm tight frame (FUNTF). In the present paper, we develop probabilistic versions of tight frames and FUNTFs to significantly weaken the requirements on the random choice of points to obtain an approximate finite tight frame. Namely, points can be chosen from any probabilistic tight frame, they do not have to be identically distributed, nor have unit norm. We also observe that classes of random matrices used in compressed sensing are induced by probabilistic tight frames.","M.

0,Time Inhomogeneous Mutation Models with Birth Date Dependence,"The classic Luria–Delbrück model for fluctuation analysis is extended to the case where the split instant distributions of cells are not i.i.d.: the lifetime of each cell is assumed to depend on its birth date. This model takes also into account cell deaths and non-exponentially distributed lifetimes. In particular, it is possible to consider subprobability distributions and to model non-exponential growth. The extended model leads to a family of probability distributions which depend on the expected number of mutations, the death probability of mutant cells, and the split instant distributions of normal and mutant cells. This is deduced from the Bellman–Harris integral equation, written for the birth date inhomogeneous case. A new theorem of convergence for the final mutant counts is proved, using an analytic method. Particular examples like the Haldane model or the case where hazard functions of the split-instant distributions are proportional are studied. The Luria–Delbrück distribution with cell deaths is recovered.

The dual of a linear lifting is a transition expectation in the sense of [3] and we characterize those transition expectations which arise from compound states in the sense of [22]. In Section 2 we characterize those liftings whose range is contained in the closed convex hull of product states and we prove that the corresponding quantum Markov chains [2] are uniquely determined by a classical generalization of both the quantum random walks of [4] and the locally diagonalizable states considered in [3]. In Section 4, as a first application of the above results, we prove that the attenuation (beam splitting) process for optical communication treated in [21] can be described in a simpler and more general way in terms of liftings and of transition expectations.

0,Disintegration of positive isometric group representations on \(\varvec{\mathrm {L}^{p}}\)-spaces,"Let G be a Polish locally compact group acting on a Polish space \({{X}}\) with a G-invariant probability measure \(\mu \). We factorize the integral with respect to \(\mu \) in terms of the integrals with respect to the ergodic measures on X, and show that \(\mathrm {L}^{p}({{X}},\mu )\) (\(1\le p<\infty \)) is G-equivariantly isometrically lattice isomorphic to an \({\mathrm {L}^p}\)-direct integral of the spaces \(\mathrm {L}^{p}({{X}},\lambda )\), where \(\lambda \) ranges over the ergodic measures on X.

0,A geometric analysis of fast-slow models for stochastic gene expression,"Stochastic models for gene expression frequently exhibit dynamics on several different scales. One potential time-scale separation is caused by significant differences in the lifetimes of mRNA and protein; the ratio of the two degradation rates gives a natural small parameter in the resulting chemical master equation, allowing for the application of perturbation techniques. Here, we develop a framework for the analysis of a family of ‘fast-slow’ models for gene expression that is based on geometric singular perturbation theory. We illustrate our approach by giving a complete characterisation of a standard two-stage model which assumes transcription, translation, and degradation to be first-order reactions. In particular, we present a systematic expansion procedure for the probability-generating function that can in principle be taken to any order in the perturbation parameter, allowing for an approximation of the corresponding propagator probabilities to that same order. For illustrative purposes, we perform this expansion explicitly to first order, both on the fast and the slow time-scales; then, we combine the resulting asymptotics into a composite fast-slow expansion that is uniformly valid in time. In the process, we extend, and prove rigorously, results previously obtained by Shahrezaei and Swain (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105(45):17256–17261, 2008) and Bokes et al. (J Math Biol 64(5):829–854, 2012; J Math Biol 65(3):493–520, 2012). We verify our asymptotics by numerical simulation, and we explore its practical applicability and the effects of a variation in the system parameters and the time-scale separation. Focussing on biologically relevant parameter regimes that induce translational bursting, as well as those in which mRNA is frequently transcribed, we find that the first-order correction can significantly improve the steady-state probability distribution. Similarly, in the time-dependent scenario, inclusion of the first-order fast asymptotics results in a uniform approximation for the propagator probabilities that is superior to the slow dynamics alone. Finally, we discuss the generalisation of our geometric framework to models for regulated gene expression that involve additional stages.","Nikola Popović1, Carsten Marr2 & Peter S.

0,Tractable stochastic analysis in high dimensions via robust optimization,"Modern probability theory, whose foundation is based on the axioms set forth by Kolmogorov, is currently the major tool for performance analysis in stochastic systems. While it offers insights in understanding such systems, probability theory, in contrast to optimization, has not been developed with computational tractability as an objective when the dimension increases. Correspondingly, some of its major areas of application remain unsolved when the underlying systems become multidimensional: Queueing networks, auction design in multi-item, multi-bidder auctions, network information theory, pricing multi-dimensional options, among others. We propose a new approach to analyze stochastic systems based on robust optimization. The key idea is to replace the Kolmogorov axioms and the concept of random variables as primitives of probability theory, with uncertainty sets that are derived from some of the asymptotic implications of probability theory like the central limit theorem. In addition, we observe that several desired system properties such as incentive compatibility and individual rationality in auction design are naturally expressed in the language of robust optimization. In this way, the performance analysis questions become highly structured optimization problems (linear, semidefinite, mixed integer) for which there exist efficient, practical algorithms that are capable of solving problems in high dimensions. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves computationally tractable methods for (a) analyzing queueing networks, (b) designing multi-item, multi-bidder auctions with budget constraints, and (c) pricing multi-dimensional options.",Chaithanya Bandi1 & Dimitris Bertsimas,Mathematical Programming,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-012-0567-2,"Stochastic analysis,Robust optimization,Queueing,Mechanism design,Option pricing"

To reduce this noise a certain heuristic, utilizing regions in the phase space in which the system behaves almost deterministically, is applied. Using this heuristic, we show that in order to decrease the probability of a customers overflow in one of the queues in the network, the server in that same queue – contrary to intuition – should be shut down for a short period of time. Further noise reduction is obtained if the server in the second queue is briefly shut down as well, when certain conditions hold.","Arnon Arazi1, Eshel Ben-Jacob2 & Uri Yechiali",Mathematical Methods of Operations Research,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00186-005-0041-5,"Queueing networks,Oscillations,Fluid approximation,Control,Dominant probability"
0, Asymptotic arbitrage in large financial markets," A large financial market is described by a sequence of standard general models of continuous trading. It turns out that the absence of asymptotic arbitrage of the first kind is equivalent to the contiguity of sequence of objective probabilities with respect to the sequence of upper envelopes of equivalent martingale measures, while absence of asymptotic arbitrage of the second kind is equivalent to the contiguity of the sequence of lower envelopes of equivalent martingale measures with respect to the sequence of objective probabilities. We express criteria of contiguity in terms of the Hellinger processes. As examples, we study a large market with asset prices given by linear stochastic equations which may have random volatilities, the Ross Arbitrage Pricing Model, and a discrete-time model with two assets and infinite horizon. The suggested theory can be considered as a natural extension of Arbirage Pricing Theory covering the continuous as well as the discrete time case.

0,Simulated annealing in the presence of noise,"
In many practical optimization problems, evaluation of a solution is subject to noise, e.g., due to stochastic simulations or measuring errors. Therefore, heuristics are needed that are capable of handling such noise. This paper first reviews the state-of-the-art in applying simulated annealing to noisy optimization problems. Then, two new algorithmic variants are proposed: an improved version of stochastic annealing that allows for arbitrary annealing schedules, and a new approach called simulated annealing in noisy environments (SANE). The latter integrates ideas from statistical sequential selection in order to reduce the number of samples required for making an acceptance decision with sufficient statistical confidence. Finally, SANE is shown to significantly outperform other state-of-the-art simulated annealing techniques on a stochastic travelling salesperson problem.

0,Assortment and Reciprocity Mechanisms for Promotion of Cooperation in a Model of Multilevel Selection,"In the study of the evolution of cooperation, many mechanisms have been proposed to help overcome the self-interested cheating that is individually optimal in the Prisoners’ Dilemma game. These mechanisms include assortative or networked social interactions, other-regarding preferences considering the payoffs of others, reciprocity rules to establish cooperation as a social norm, and multilevel selection involving simultaneous competition between individuals favoring cheaters and competition between groups favoring cooperators. In this paper, we build on recent work studying PDE replicator equations for multilevel selection to understand how within-group mechanisms of assortment, other-regarding preferences, and both direct and indirect reciprocity can help to facilitate cooperation in concert with evolutionary competition between groups. We consider a group-structured population in which interactions between individuals consist of Prisoners’ Dilemma games and study the dynamics of multilevel competition determined by the payoffs individuals receive when interacting according to these within-group mechanisms. We find that the presence of each of these mechanisms acts synergistically with multilevel selection for the promotion of cooperation, decreasing the strength of between-group competition required to sustain long-time cooperation and increasing the collective payoff achieved by the population. However, we find that only other-regarding preferences allow for the achievement of socially optimal collective payoffs for Prisoners’ Dilemma games in which average payoff is maximized by an intermediate mix of cooperators and defectors. For the other three mechanisms, the multilevel dynamics remain susceptible to a shadow of lower-level selection, as the collective outcome fails to exceed the payoff of the all-cooperator group.","Daniel B.

Discrete approximations to chance constrained and mixed-integer two-stage stochastic programs require moderately sized scenario sets. The relevant distances of (multivariate) probability distributions for deriving quantitative stability results for such stochastic programs are ℬ-discrepancies, where the class ℬ of Borel sets depends on their structural properties. Hence, the optimal scenario reduction problem for such models is stated with respect to ℬ-discrepancies. In this paper, upper and lower bounds, and some explicit solutions for optimal scenario reduction problems are derived. In addition, we develop heuristic algorithms for determining nearly optimally reduced probability measures, discuss the case of the cell discrepancy (or Kolmogorov metric) in some detail and provide some numerical experience.

In this study we address these problems by introducing novel second-and third-order moment closure approximations which we apply to the stochastic SI and SIS epidemic models. In the case of the SI model, which has a highly skewed distribution of infection, we develop a second-order approximation based on the beta-binomial distribution. In addition, a closure approximation based on mixture distribution is developed in order to capture the behaviour of the stochastic SIS model around the threshold between persistence and extinction. This mixture approximation comprises a probability distribution designed to capture the quasi-equilibrium probabilities of the system and a probability mass at 0 which represents the probability of extinction. Two third-order versions of this mixture approximation are considered in which the log-normal and the beta-binomial are used to model the quasi-equilibrium distribution. Comparison with simulation results shows: (1) the beta-binomial approximation is flexible in shape and matches the skewness predicted by simulation as shown by the stochastic SI model and (2) mixture approximations are able to predict transient and extinction behaviour as shown by the stochastic SIS model, in marked contrast with existing approaches. We also apply our mixture approximation to approximate a likehood function and carry out point and interval parameter estimation.","Isthrinayagy Krishnarajah1,2, Alex Cook1,2, Glenn Marion2 & …Gavin Gibson",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1016/j.bulm.2004.11.002,"Moment Closure,Saddlepoint Approximation,Subcritical Region,Mixture Approximation,Moment Closure Approximation"

A variation of simulated annealing (SA), termed static simulated annealing (S2A), is analyzed using this measure. S2A uses a fixed cooling schedule during the algorithm execution.

A convergent particle estimator of the conditional expectation of a chosen cost function on a given receding control horizon is built, leading to an almost sure (a.s.) epi-convergent estimator of the NMPC cost-to-go criterion. The estimator of the expected cost function relies upon simulations and on a recently developed nonparametric convergent particle estimator of a multi-step ahead conditional probability density function (pdf) of the state variables.

0,Smoothed analysis for tensor methods in unsupervised learning,"Smoothed analysis is a powerful paradigm in overcoming worst-case intractability in high-dimensional data analysis and unsupervised learning. While polynomial time smoothed analysis guarantees have been obtained for worst-case intractable problems like tensor decomposition and learning mixtures of Gaussians, such guarantees have been hard to obtain for several other important problems in data analysis. A core technical challenge in analyzing algorithms is obtaining lower bounds on the least singular value for random matrix ensembles with dependent entries, that are given by low-degree polynomials of a few base underlying random variables. In this work, we address this challenge by obtaining high-confidence lower bounds on the least singular value of new classes of structured random matrix ensembles of the above kind. We then use these bounds to design algorithms with polynomial time smoothed analysis guarantees for the following three important problems in high-dimensional data analysis:

Higher order tensor decompositions, where we generalize and analyze the so-called FOOBI algorithm of Cardoso. This allows us to obtain polynomially robust decomposition algorithms for \(2\ell \)’th order tensors with rank \(O(n^{\ell })\).


Learning overcomplete hidden markov models, where the size of the state space is any polynomial in the dimension of the observations. This gives the first polynomial time guarantees for learning overcomplete HMMs in the smoothed analysis model.


Robust subspace recovery, when the fraction \(\alpha \) of inliers in the d-dimensional subspace \(T \subset {\mathbb {R}}^n\) is at least \(\alpha > (d/n)^\ell \) for any constant \(\ell \in {\mathbb {Z}}_+\). This contrasts with the known worst-case intractability when \(\alpha < d/n\), and the previous smoothed analysis result which needed \(\alpha > d/n\) ([33]).

We show how the characteristics of the graph (degree distribution) influence the vaccination efficiency for optimal strategies, and we compute the limiting final size of the epidemic depending on the degree distribution of the graph and the parameters of infection, recovery and vaccination.

0,Ergodicity and Accuracy of Optimal Particle Filters for Bayesian Data Assimilation,"Data assimilation refers to the methodology of combining dynamical models and observed data with the objective of improving state estimation. Most data assimilation algorithms are viewed as approximations of the Bayesian posterior (filtering distribution) on the signal given the observations. Some of these approximations are controlled, such as particle filters which may be refined to produce the true filtering distribution in the large particle number limit, and some are uncontrolled, such as ensemble Kalman filter methods which do not recover the true filtering distribution in the large ensemble limit. Other data assimilation algorithms, such as cycled 3DVAR methods, may be thought of as controlled estimators of the state, in the small observational noise scenario, but are also uncontrolled in general in relation to the true filtering distribution. For particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters it is of practical importance to understand how and why data assimilation methods can be effective when used with a fixed small number of particles, since for many large-scale applications it is not practical to deploy algorithms close to the large particle limit asymptotic. In this paper, the authors address this question for particle filters and, in particular, study their accuracy (in the small noise limit) and ergodicity (for noisy signal and observation) without appealing to the large particle number limit. The authors first overview the accuracy and minorization properties for the true filtering distribution, working in the setting of conditional Gaussianity for the dynamics-observation model. They then show that these properties are inherited by optimal particle filters for any fixed number of particles, and use the minorization to establish ergodicity of the filters. For completeness we also prove large particle number consistency results for the optimal particle filters, by writing the update equations for the underlying distributions as recursions. In addition to looking at the optimal particle filter with standard resampling, they derive all the above results for (what they term) the Gaussianized optimal particle filter and show that the theoretical properties are favorable for this method, when compared to the standard optimal particle filter.","David Kelly1,2 & Andrew M.

0,Improved adaptive group testing algorithms with applications to multiple access channels and dead sensor diagnosis,"
We study group-testing algorithms for resolving broadcast conflicts on a multiple access channel (MAC) and for identifying the dead sensors in a mobile ad hoc wireless network. In group-testing algorithms, we are asked to identify all the defective items in a set of items when we can test arbitrary subsets of items. In the standard group-testing problem, the result of a test is binary—the tested subset either contains defective items or not. In the more generalized versions we study in this paper, the result of each test is non-binary. For example, it may indicate whether the number of defective items contained in the tested subset is zero, one, or at least two.

We give adaptive algorithms that are provably more efficient than previous group testing algorithms. We also show how our algorithms can be applied to solve conflict resolution on a MAC and dead sensor diagnosis. Dead sensor diagnosis poses an interesting challenge compared to MAC resolution, because dead sensors are not locally detectable, nor are they themselves active participants.

The sample path used in the algorithms can be obtained by observing the operation of a real system. We give a simple example to explain the advantages of the sample path-based approach over the traditional computation-based approach: matrix inversion is not required; some transition probabilities do not have to be known; it may save storage space; and it gives the flexibility of iterating the actions for a subset of the state space in each iteration. The effect of the estimation errors and the convergence property of the sample path-based approach are studied. Finally, we propose a fast algorithm, which updates the policy whenever the system reaches a particular set of states and prove that the algorithm converges to the true optimal policy with probability one under some conditions. The sample path-based approach may have important applications to the design and management of engineering systems, such as high speed communication networks.","X. R.

We also handle the case of split graphs. We show that probabilistic coloring is NP-hard, even under identical vertex-probabilities, that it is approximable by a polynomial time standard-approximation schema but existence of a fully a polynomial time standard-approximation schema is impossible, even for identical vertex-probabilities, unless P=NP. We finally study differential-approximation of probabilistic coloring in both bipartite and split graphs.

0,A comparison of fixed and variable capacity-addition policies for outpatient capacity allocation,"Residents of mainland China always come to the first-class hospitals. Facing limitations to medical resources, hospital managers consider adding some potential capacity beyond the regular daily capacity to meet demands and improve the profit. This paper systematically studies the capacity-addition policy, and compares two kinds of them: fixed capacity-addition policy (F-CAP) and variable capacity-addition policy (V-CAP). The former sets the additional capacity by simple calculations according to experiences or history statistics. Under the V-CAP policy, the additional capacity is determined by solving an optimization model rather than a constant. The V-CAP definitely achieves the optimal expected profit, which can be regarded as the benchmark that leads to the best improvement. Since the F-CAP is widely used in many first-class hospitals in practice, this paper attempts to explore in which situations the F-CAP can achieve a similar improvement of the V-CAP, and in what environments the additional capacity should be a variable. In addition to focusing on additional capacity, both policies allocate the regular capacity to two types of patient: routine patients and same-day patients, who have different no-show probabilities. We formulate linear integer programming models of F-CAP and V-CAP to maximize the expected profit. Several propositions and corollaries are proved to cut off the solution space and accelerate the search process. The optimal additional capacity can be directly determined by these properties, and the optimal value is non-decreasing with the regular capacity allocated to routine patients. Numerical experiments indicate that the optimal total supply of regular capacity and additional capacity is always less than the expected total demand. The F-CAP is recommended to the environments with low no-show probabilities of routine patients and same-day patients, moderate expected total demand, correlation coefficient of demands and regular capacity, where the reduction of the expected profit is less than 5% of the F-CAP compared to the V-CAP.","Bowen Jiang1, Jiafu Tang

0,On the computational tractability of statistical estimation on amenable graphs,"We consider the problem of estimating a vector of discrete variables \(\theta = (\theta _1,\cdots ,\theta _n)\), based on noisy observations \(Y_{uv}\) of the pairs \((\theta _u,\theta _v)\) on the edges of a graph \(G=([n],E)\). This setting comprises a broad family of statistical estimation problems, including group synchronization on graphs, community detection, and low-rank matrix estimation. A large body of theoretical work has established sharp thresholds for weak and exact recovery, and sharp characterizations of the optimal reconstruction accuracy in such models, focusing however on the special case of Erdös–Rényi-type random graphs. An important finding of this line of work is the ubiquity of an information-computation gap. Namely, for many models of interest, a large gap is found between the optimal accuracy achievable by any statistical method, and the optimal accuracy achieved by known polynomial-time algorithms. Moreover, it is expected in many situations that this gap is robust to small amounts of additional side information revealed about the \(\theta _i\)’s. How does the structure of the graph G affect this picture? Is the information-computation gap a general phenomenon or does it only apply to specific families of graphs? We prove that the picture is dramatically different for graph sequences converging to amenable graphs (including, for instance, d-dimensional grids). We consider a model in which an arbitrarily small fraction of the vertex labels is revealed, and show that a linear-time local algorithm can achieve reconstruction accuracy that is arbitrarily close to the information-theoretic optimum. We contrast this to the case of random graphs. Indeed, focusing on group synchronization on random regular graphs, we prove that local algorithms are unable to have non-trivial performance below the so-called Kesten–Stigum threshold, even when a small amount of side information is revealed.","Ahmed El Alaoui

For each of the functions the sum over the excursions that begin by time t is normalized in an appropriate manner. Conditions are obtained for the convergence of the sequence of normalized sums to the local time evaluated at time t. We obtain a unified structure for convergence theorems which includes some new constructions of local time as well as many constructions previously obtained by quite varied techniques.,Bert Fristedt1 & S.

0,The number of solutions for random regular NAE-SAT,"Recent work has made substantial progress in understanding the transitions of random constraint satisfaction problems. In particular, for several of these models, the exact satisfiability threshold has been rigorously determined, confirming predictions of statistical physics. Here we revisit one of these models, random regular k-nae-sat: knowing the satisfiability threshold, it is natural to study, in the satisfiable regime, the number of solutions in a typical instance. We prove here that these solutions have a well-defined free energy (limiting exponential growth rate), with explicit value matching the one-step replica symmetry breaking prediction. The proof develops new techniques for analyzing a certain “survey propagation model” associated to this problem. We believe that these methods may be applicable in a wide class of related problems.","Allan Sly1, Nike Sun2 & Yumeng Zhang",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-021-01029-5,"60K35,82B44"

In the process a positive real number, called energy, is attached to each site of the lattice and each couple of adjacent sites exchange thier energy by random amounts at random times. The law of the exchange is such that the sum of the total energy is conserved, and that the process is reversible and of gradient type for the energy distribution. We show that under diffusion type scaling of space and time, the macroscopic energy distribution converges to a deterministic limit which is characterized by a non-linear diffusion equation ∂ρ/∂t=2−1ΔP(ρ), whereP is an increasing function which in a typical case equals const·ρ2.",Yuki suzuki1 & Kôhei Uchiyama,Probability Theory and Related Fields,1993,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01197337,"60K35,82A50"
0,On the structure and solutions of functional equations arising from queueing models,"It is a survey on functional equations of a certain type, for functions in two complex variables, which often arise in queueing models. They share a common pattern despite their apparently different forms. In particular, they invariably characterize the probability generating function of the bivariate distribution characterizing a two-queue system and their forms depend on the composition of the underlying system. Unfortunately, there is no general methodology of solving them, but rather various ad-hoc techniques depending on the nature of a particular equation; most of the techniques involve advanced complex analysis tools. Also, the known solutions to particular cases of this type of equations are in general of quite involved forms and therefore it is very difficult to apply them practically. So, it is clear that the issues connected with finding useful descriptions of solutions to these equations create a huge area of research with numerous open problems. The aim of this article is to stimulate a methodical study of this area. To this end we provide a survey of the queueing literature with such two-place functional equations. We also present several observations obtained while preparing it. We hope that in this way we will make it easier to take some steps forward on the road towards a (more or less) general solving theory for this interesting class of equations.","El-sayed El-hady1, Janusz Brzdęk2 & Hamed Nassar",Aequationes mathematicae,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00010-017-0471-1,"05A15,30D05,30E25,39B32,60K25,65Q20"
0,"Covariance’s Loss is Privacy’s Gain: Computationally Efficient, Private and Accurate Synthetic Data","The protection of private information is of vital importance in data-driven research, business and government. The conflict between privacy and utility has triggered intensive research in the computer science and statistics communities, who have developed a variety of methods for privacy-preserving data release. Among the main concepts that have emerged are anonymity and differential privacy. Today, another solution is gaining traction, synthetic data. However, the road to privacy is paved with NP-hard problems. In this paper, we focus on the NP-hard challenge to develop a synthetic data generation method that is computationally efficient, comes with provable privacy guarantees and rigorously quantifies data utility. We solve a relaxed version of this problem by studying a fundamental, but a first glance completely unrelated, problem in probability concerning the concept of covariance loss. Namely, we find a nearly optimal and constructive answer to the question how much information is lost when we take conditional expectation. Surprisingly, this excursion into theoretical probability produces mathematical techniques that allow us to derive constructive, approximately optimal solutions to difficult applied problems concerning microaggregation, privacy and synthetic data.","March Boedihardjo1, Thomas Strohmer2 & Roman Vershynin",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-022-09591-7,"Differential privacy,Synthetic data,Covariance loss"

0,Simulation algorithm of typical modulated Poisson-Voronoi cells and application to telecommunication network modelling,"We consider modulated Poisson-Voronoi tessellations, intended as models for telecommunication networks on a nationwide scale. By introducing an algorithm for the simulation of the typical cell of the latter tessellation, we lay the mathematical foundation for such a global analysis. A modulated Poisson-Voronoi tessellation has an intensity which is spatially variable and, hence, is able to provide a broad spectrum of model scenarios. Nevertheless, the considered tessellation model is stationary and we consider the case where the modulation is generated by a Boolean germ-grain model with circular grains. These circular grains may either have a deterministic or random but bounded radius. Furthermore, based on the introduced simulation algorithm for the typical cell and on Neveu’s exchange formula for Palm probability measures, we show how to estimate the mean distance from a randomly chosen location to its nearest Voronoi cell nucleus. The latter distance is interpreted as an important basic cost characteristic in telecommunication networks, especially for the computation of more sophisticated functionals later on. Said location is chosen at random among the points of another modulated Poisson process where the modulation is generated by the same Boolean model as for the nuclei. The case of a completely random placement for the considered location is thereby included as a special case. The estimation of the cost functional is performed in a way such that a simulation of the location placement is not necessary. Test methods for the correctness of the algorithm based on tests for random software are briefly discussed. Numerical examples are provided for characteristics of the typical cell as well as for the cost functional. We conclude with some remarks about extensions and modifications of the model regarded in this paper, like modulated Poisson—Delaunay tessellations.","F. Fleischer1,2, C. Gloaguen3, H. Schmidt1,2, V.

0,Reconstruction and estimation in the planted partition model,"The planted partition model (also known as the stochastic blockmodel) is a classical cluster-exhibiting random graph model that has been extensively studied in statistics, physics, and computer science. In its simplest form, the planted partition model is a model for random graphs on \(n\) nodes with two equal-sized clusters, with an between-class edge probability of \(q\) and a within-class edge probability of \(p\). Although most of the literature on this model has focused on the case of increasing degrees (ie. \(pn, qn \rightarrow \infty \) as \(n \rightarrow \infty \)), the sparse case \(p, q = O(1/n)\) is interesting both from a mathematical and an applied point of view. A striking conjecture of Decelle, Krzkala, Moore and Zdeborová based on deep, non-rigorous ideas from statistical physics gave a precise prediction for the algorithmic threshold of clustering in the sparse planted partition model. In particular, if \(p = a/n\) and \(q = b/n\), then Decelle et al. conjectured that it is possible to cluster in a way correlated with the true partition if \((a - b)^2 > 2(a + b)\), and impossible if \((a - b)^2 < 2(a + b)\). By comparison, the best-known rigorous result is that of Coja-Oghlan, who showed that clustering is possible if \((a - b)^2 > C (a + b)\) for some sufficiently large \(C\). We prove half of their prediction, showing that it is indeed impossible to cluster if \((a - b)^2 < 2(a + b)\). Furthermore we show that it is impossible even to estimate the model parameters from the graph when \((a - b)^2 < 2(a + b)\); on the other hand, we provide a simple and efficient algorithm for estimating \(a\) and \(b\) when \((a - b)^2 > 2(a + b)\). Following Decelle et al, our work establishes a rigorous connection between the clustering problem, spin-glass models on the Bethe lattice and the so called reconstruction problem. This connection points to fascinating applications and open problems.","Elchanan Mossel1,2, Joe Neeman1 & Allan Sly1,",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-014-0576-6,"Primary 05C80,Secondary 60J85,90B15,91D30"

Whenever the system is empty, the server immediately takes a vacation. If there is at least one customer found waiting in the queue upon returning from a vacation, the server will be immediately activated for service. Otherwise, if no customers are waiting for service at the end of a vacation, the server either remains idle with probability p or leaves for another vacation with probability 1 −p. Whenever one or more customers arrive when the server is idle, the server immediately starts providing service for the arrivals. The server may also meet an unpredictable breakdown and the repair may be delayed. For such a system the authors derive the distributions of some important system characteristics, such as the system size distribution at a random epoch and at a departure epoch, the system size distribution at the busy period initiation epoch, and the distribution of the idle period and the busy period. The authors perform a numerical analysis for changes in the system characteristics, along with changes in specific values of the system parameters.

0,Combination of Statistical Similarity Measure and Derivative Morphological Profile Approach for Oil Slick Detection in SAR Images,"Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is widely used to detect and monitor oil pollution on the sea surface. As it is sensitive to surface roughness, the presence of oil film on the sea surface decreases the backscattering of this target type resulting in a dark feature patches in SAR images. In this paper, a new approach for oil slicks detection is presented. It is mainly based on SAR image texture analysis using the combination of a statistical similarity measure and a derivative morphological profile. Oil slicks signature is extracted trough two steps procedure. First, SAR image inspection is performed in order to highlight the dark spots suspected to be oil slicks. The inspection is achieved through a similarity measure between a local probability density function (lpdf) of clean water and the lpdf of the area to be inspected. The local distribution is estimated in the neighbourhood of each pixel and compared to a reference one using the Kullback-Leibler KL distance between distributions. Second, and once spots highlighted, texture features extraction using the Derivative Morphological Profile is porformed in order to improve the detection results. algorithm has been applied to Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) and European Remote Sensing (ERS) images and it yields an accurate segmentation results. Indeed, the features extraction improves the detection slicks probability Pd of ASAR, respectively ERS, images from 93.08 %to 97.37 %and from 96.32 to 99.57 % on one hand, and reduces the false alarms probability respectively from 6.92 to 2.63 %and from 3.68 to 0.59 % on the other hand.","Bahia Lounis1, Grégoire Mercier2 & Aichouche Belhadj-Aissa",Journal of Mathematical Modelling and Algorithms,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10852-012-9206-4,"Statistical similarity measure,Derivative morphological profile,SAR image analysis,Oil slicks detection"

-disjoint-clique problem. The input is an undirected graph \(G\) in which the nodes represent data items, and edges indicate a similarity between the corresponding items. The problem is to find within the graph \(k\) disjoint cliques that cover the maximum number of nodes of \(G\). This problem may be understood as a general way to pose the classical ‘clustering’ problem. In clustering, one is given data items and a distance function, and one wishes to partition the data into disjoint clusters of data items, such that the items in each cluster are close to each other. Our formulation additionally allows ‘noise’ nodes to be present in the input data that are not part of any of the cliques. The \(k\)-disjoint-clique problem is NP-hard, but we show that a convex relaxation can solve it in polynomial time for input instances constructed in a certain way. The input instances for which our algorithm finds the optimal solution consist of \(k\) disjoint large cliques (called ‘planted cliques’) that are then obscured by noise edges inserted either at random or by an adversary, as well as additional nodes not belonging to any of the \(k\) planted cliques.",Brendan P.

More precisely, we provide the proper renormalizations for the extremely large values of the supremum of the local time. This is done by establishing a—so far unknown—connection between the latter and the exponential functional of a Lévy process conditioned to stay positive, which allows us to use the properties of such exponential functionals to characterize the sought behavior. It appears from our results that the renormalization of the extremely large values of the supremum of the local time is determined by the asymptotic behavior of the Laplace exponent of the Lévy environment and is surprisingly greater than the renormalization that was previously known for the recurrent case.

The subsets \(\mathcal{T}_1 = \mathcal{X}_1 \)∪{CCC} and \(\mathcal{T}_2 = \mathcal{X}_2 \)∪{GGG} of 21 trinucleotides have a preferential occurrence in the shifted frames 1 and 2 respectively (frame 0 shifted by one and two nucleotides respectively in the 5′-3′ direction). \(\mathcal{T}_1 \) and \(\mathcal{T}_2 \) are complementary to each other. The subset \(\mathcal{T}_0 \) contains the subset \(\mathcal{X}_0 \) which has the rarity property (6 × 10−8) to be a complementary maximal circular code with two permutated maximal circular codes \(\mathcal{X}_1 \) and \(\mathcal{X}_2 \) in the frames 1 and 2 respectively. \(\mathcal{X}_0 \) is called a C3 code.A quantitative study of these three subsets \(\mathcal{T}_0 ,\mathcal{T}_1 ,\mathcal{T}_2 \) in the three frames 0, 1, 2 of protein genes, and the 5′ and 3′ regions of eukaryotes, shows that their occurrence frequencies are constant functions of the trinucleotide positions in the sequences. The frequencies of \(\mathcal{T}_0 ,\mathcal{T}_1 ,\mathcal{T}_2 \) in the frame 0 of protein genes are 49, 28.5 and 22.5% respectively. In contrast, the frequencies of \(\mathcal{T}_0 ,\mathcal{T}_1 ,\mathcal{T}_2 \) in the 5′ and 3′ regions of eukaryotes, are independent of the frame. Indeed, the frequency of \(\mathcal{T}_0 \) in the three frames of 5′ (respectively 3′) regions is equal to 35.5% (respectively 38%) and is greater than the frequencies \(\mathcal{T}_1 \) and \(\mathcal{T}_2 \), both equal to 32.25% (respectively 31%) in the three frames.Several frequency asymmetries unexpectedly observed (e.g. the frequency difference between \(\mathcal{T}_1 \) and \(\mathcal{T}_2 \) in the frame 0), are related to a new property of the subset \(\mathcal{T}_0 \) involving substitutions. An evolutionary analytical model at three parameters (p, q, t) based on an independent mixing of the 22 codons (trinucleotides in frame 0) of \(\mathcal{T}_0 \) with equiprobability (1/22) followed by t ≈ 4 substitutions per codon according to the proportions p ≈ 0.1; q ≈ 0.1 and r = 1 − p − q ≈ 0.8 in the three codon sites respectively, retrieves the frequencies of \(\mathcal{T}_0 ,\mathcal{T}_1 ,\mathcal{T}_2 \) observed in the three frames of protein genes and explains these asymmetries. Furthermore, the same model (0.1, 0.1, t) after t ≈ 22 substitutions per codon, retrieves the statistical properties observed in the three frames of the 5′ and 3′ regions.

We improve previous work by demonstrating the occurrence of log-logarithmic fluctuations around the leading order polynomial behaviour for the on-diagonal part of the quenched heat kernel. In addition we give two-sided estimates for the averaged heat kernel, and we show that the exponents that appear in the off-diagonal parts of the quenched and averaged versions of the heat kernel differ. Finally, we derive various scaling limits for the heat kernel, the implications of which include enabling us to sharpen the known asymptotics regarding the on-diagonal part of the averaged heat kernel and the expected distance travelled by the associated simple random walk.","M.

0,Incremental constraint projection methods for variational inequalities,"We consider the solution of strongly monotone variational inequalities of the form \(F(x^*)'(x-x^*)\ge 0\), for all \(x\in X\). We focus on special structures that lend themselves to sampling, such as when \(X\) is the intersection of a large number of sets, and/or \(F\) is an expected value or is the sum of a large number of component functions. We propose new methods that combine elements of incremental constraint projection and stochastic gradient. These methods are suitable for problems involving large-scale data, as well as problems with certain online or distributed structures. We analyze the convergence and the rate of convergence of these methods with various types of sampling schemes, and we establish a substantial rate of convergence advantage for random sampling over cyclic sampling.",Mengdi Wang1 & Dimitri P.

0,Multi-objective optimization by learning automata,"This paper presents a novel method of multi-objective optimization by learning automata (MOLA) to solve complex multi-objective optimization problems. MOLA consists of multiple automata which perform sequential search in the solution domain. Each automaton undertakes dimensional search in the selected dimension of the solution domain, and each dimension is divided into a certain number of cells. Each automaton performs a continuous search action, instead of discrete actions, within cells. The merits of MOLA have been demonstrated, in comparison with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), on eleven multi-objective benchmark functions and an optimal problem in the midwestern American electric power system which is integrated with wind power, respectively. The simulation results have shown that MOLA can obtain more accurate and evenly distributed Pareto fronts, in comparison with MOEA/D and NSGA-II.","H. L. Liao1 & Q. H.

0,Valuing catastrophe bonds involving correlation and CIR interest rate model,"Natural catastrophes lead to problems of insurance and reinsurance industry. Classic insurance mechanisms are often inadequate for dealing with consequences of catastrophic events. Therefore, new financial instruments, including catastrophe bonds (cat bonds), were developed. In this paper we price the catastrophe bonds with a generalized payoff structure, assuming that the bondholder’s payoff depends on an underlying asset driven by a stochastic jump-diffusion process. Simultaneously, the risk-free spot interest rate has also a stochastic form and is described by the multi-factor Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model. We assume the possibility of correlation between the Brownian part of the underlying asset and the components of the interest rate model. Using stochastic methods, we prove the valuation formula, which can be applied to the cat bonds with various payoff functions. We use adaptive Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the numerical properties of the obtained pricing formula for various settings, including some similar to the practical cases.","Piotr Nowak1 & Maciej Romaniuk1,",Computational and Applied Mathematics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-016-0348-2,"Catastrophe bonds,Asset pricing,Stochastic models,Monte Carlo simulations,CIR model"
0,Delayed feedback makes neuronal firing statistics non-Markovian,"The instantaneous state of a neural network consists of both the degree of excitation of each neuron and the positions of impulses in communication lines between the neurons. In neurophysiological experiments, the times of neuronal firing are recorded but not the state of communication lines. However, future spiking moments substantially depend on the past positions of impulses in the lines. This suggests that the sequence of intervals between firing moments (interspike intervals, ISI) in the network can be non-Markovian. In the present paper, we analyze this problem for the simplest possible neural “network,” namely, for a single neuron with delayed feedback. The neuron receives excitatory input both from the input Poisson process and from its own output through the feedback line. We obtain exact expressions for the conditional probability density P(t

0,On Inequalities for Probabilities of Joint Occurrence of Several Events,"Inequalities for probabilities of joint occurrence of several events are important in combinatorial analysis, probability theory, and many applications. This paper describes a method for constructing upper and lower bounds for probabilities of simultaneous occurrence of r out of n events. The method uses different representations of the probabilities as sums and estimates the terms separately. This yields inequalities that are more accurate than the earlier bounds and corresponding to trivial representations. The resulting new inequalities are optimal. There are examples showing that these inequalities can become equalities. Similar inequalities have been proven for conditional probabilities of corresponding events with respect to some σ-field.

The method uses (approximate) partial second-order (curvature) information, so that the algorithm performance is more robust when applied to highly nonseparable or ill conditioned problems. We call the method Flexible Coordinate Descent (FCD). At each iteration of FCD, a block of coordinates is sampled randomly, a quadratic model is formed about that block and the model is minimized approximately/inexactly to determine the search direction. An inexpensive line search is then employed to ensure a monotonic decrease in the objective function and acceptance of large step sizes. We present several high probability iteration complexity results to show that convergence of FCD is guaranteed theoretically.

0,What life cycle graphs can tell about the evolution of life histories,"We analyze long-term evolutionary dynamics in a large class of life history models. The model family is characterized by discrete-time population dynamics and a finite number of individual states such that the life cycle can be described in terms of a population projection matrix. We allow an arbitrary number of demographic parameters to be subject to density-dependent population regulation and two or more demographic parameters to be subject to evolutionary change. Our aim is to identify structural features of life cycles and modes of population regulation that correspond to specific evolutionary dynamics. Our derivations are based on a fitness proxy that is an algebraically simple function of loops within the life cycle. This allows us to phrase the results in terms of properties of such loops which are readily interpreted biologically. The following results could be obtained. First, we give sufficient conditions for the existence of optimisation principles in models with an arbitrary number of evolving traits. These models are then classified with respect to their appropriate optimisation principle. Second, under the assumption of just two evolving traits we identify structural features of the life cycle that determine whether equilibria of the monomorphic adaptive dynamics (evolutionarily singular points) correspond to fitness minima or maxima. Third, for one class of frequency-dependent models, where optimisation is not possible, we present sufficient conditions that allow classifying singular points in terms of the curvature of the trade-off curve.

We assume that at an early exercise time the investor can borrow the amount she has to pay for the option holder by entering a short position in the numéraire asset and that this loan in turn will mature at the expiration date. We model and solve a partial hedging problem, where the investor’s purpose is to find a minimal amount at which she can hedge the above-mentioned loan with a given probability, while the potential shortfall is bounded above by a certain number of numéraire assets. A knapsack problem approach and greedy algorithm are used in solving the problem.

Typical examples of such a pathogen are influenza-type viruses. We allow for time-varying infectivity levels among individuals, and model the probability of infection per contact as a function of the clinical signals. In order to accomplish this, we introduce a modified chain-binomial Reed-Frost model. We obtain an expression for the basic reproduction ratio and determine conditions which guarantee that the epidemic does not survive in the long-term. These conditions being functions of the signal’s distribution, they can be used to design and evaluate interventions, such as treatment protocols.","Renée X. de Menezes1, Neli R. S.

In order to increase the efficiency of the random-search algorithm it is proposed to change the energy functional by raising to a power the matrix it is based on. We demonstrate that this brings about changes of the energy surface: deep minima displace slightly in the space and become still deeper and their attraction areas grow significantly. Experiments show that this approach results in a considerable displacement of the spectrum of the sought-for minima to the area of greater depth, and the probability of finding the global minimum increases abruptly (by a factor of 103 in the case of the 10 × 10 Edwards–Anderson spin glass).",Iakov Karandashev1 & Boris Kryzhanovsky,Journal of Global Optimization,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-012-9947-7,"Binary minimization,Quadratic functional,Energy landscape transformation"

We apply this criterion on two representative examples: 2D Navier–Stokes (NS) equations and Complex Ginzburg–Landau (CGL) equation with a locally Lipschitz noise. Due to the possible degeneracy of the noise, Doob theorem cannot be applied. Hence, a coupling method is used in the spirit of Kuksin and Shirikyan (J. Math. Pures Appl. 1:567–602, 2002) and Mattingly (Commun. Math. Phys. 230:421–462, 2002).Previous results require assumptions on the covariance of the noise which might seem restrictive and artificial. For instance, for NS and CGL, the covariance operator is supposed to be diagonal in the eigenbasis of the Laplacian and not depending on the high modes of the solutions. The method developed in the present paper gets rid of such assumptions and only requires that the range of the covariance operator contains the low modes.",Cyril Odasso,Probability Theory and Related Fields,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-007-0057-2,"Two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations,Complex Ginzburg–Landau equations,Markov transition semi-group,Invariant measure,Ergodicity,Coupling method,Girsanov formula,Expectational Foias–Prodi estimate"

(2) In the case \(t=0\), we find a Fredholm determinant formula for a \(q\)-Laplace transform of the distribution of the last part of the Macdonald-random partition. (3) We introduce Markov dynamics that preserve the class of Macdonald processes and lead to new “integrable” 2d and 1d interacting particle systems. (4) In a large time limit transition, and as \(q\) goes to 1, the particles of these systems crystallize on a lattice, and fluctuations around the lattice converge to O’Connell’s Whittaker process that describe semi-discrete Brownian directed polymers. (5) This yields a Fredholm determinant for the Laplace transform of the polymer partition function, and taking its asymptotics we prove KPZ universality for the polymer (free energy fluctuation exponent \(1/3\) and Tracy-Widom GUE limit law). (6) Under intermediate disorder scaling, we recover the Laplace transform of the solution of the KPZ equation with narrow wedge initial data.

The reason for selecting these models was the fact that the probability density functions of the residence time of these models are formally similar to those of the Bateman and gamma-like function models, i.e., the two common deterministic models. Using published data, the analytical forms of the probability density functions of the residence time and the distributions of the simulated values of the residence time were determined on the basis of the deterministic models and the stochastic circulatory models, respectively. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed that even for 1000 xenobiotic particles, i.e., a relatively small number if the particles imply drug molecules, the probability density functions of the residence time based on the deterministic models closely matched the distributions of the simulated values of the residence time obtained on the basis of the stochastic circulatory models, provided that parameters of the latter models fulfilled selected conditions.","Gejza Wimmer1, Ladislav Dedík2, Marek Michal2, Andrea Mudríková2 & …Mária Ďurišová",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,1999,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1006/bulm.1998.0094,"Salicylic Acid,Probability Density Function,Cycle Time,Stochastic Model,Deterministic Model"
0,The equal-surplus Shapley value for chance-constrained games on finite sample spaces,"Many interactions from linear production problems, financial markets, or sequencing problems are modeled by cooperative games where payoffs to a coalition of players is a random variable. For this class of cooperative games, we introduce a two-stage value as an ex-ante agreement among players. Players are first promised their prior Shapley shares which are exactly their respective shares by the Shapley value of the expectation game. The final payoff vector is obtained by equally re-allocating the surplus when a realization of the random payoff of the grand coalition is observed. In support of the tractability of the newly introduced value called equal-surplus Shapley value, we provide a simple and compact formula. Depending on which probability distributions over the sample spaces are admissible, we present several characterization results of the equal-surplus Shapley value. This is achieved by using some classical axioms together with some other appealing axioms such as the independence of local duplication which simply requires that individual shares in a game remain unchanged when only certain events are duplicated in the sample space of a coalition without altering the probability of observing the others.","Donald Nganmegni Njoya1, Issofa Moyouwou

We show that different classes of network topologies give rise to qualitatively different types of synchrony: uniform (Erdős–Rényi) and “small-world” networks give rise to synchronization phenomena similar to that in “all-to-all” networks (in which there is a sharp onset of synchrony as coupling is increased); in contrast, in “scale-free” networks the dependence of synchrony on coupling strength is smoother. Moreover, we show that in the uniform and small-world cases, the fine details of the network are not important in determining the synchronization properties; this depends only on the mean connectivity. In contrast, for scale-free networks, the dynamics are significantly affected by the fine details of the network; in particular, they are significantly affected by the local neighborhoods of the “hubs” in the network.",R.

0,Global optimization and simulated annealing,"In this paper we are concerned with global optimization, which can be defined as the problem of finding points on a bounded subset of ℝn in which some real valued functionf assumes its optimal (maximal or minimal) value.We present a stochastic approach which is based on the simulated annealing algorithm. The approach closely follows the formulation of the simulated annealing algorithm as originally given for discrete optimization problems. The mathematical formulation is extended to continuous optimization problems, and we prove asymptotic convergence to the set of global optima. Furthermore, we discuss an implementation of the algorithm and compare its performance with other well-known algorithms.

0,Identifying the rooted species tree from the distribution of unrooted gene trees under the coalescent,"Gene trees are evolutionary trees representing the ancestry of genes sampled from multiple populations. Species trees represent populations of individuals—each with many genes—splitting into new populations or species. The coalescent process, which models ancestry of gene copies within populations, is often used to model the probability distribution of gene trees given a fixed species tree. This multispecies coalescent model provides a framework for phylogeneticists to infer species trees from gene trees using maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches. Because the coalescent models a branching process over time, all trees are typically assumed to be rooted in this setting. Often, however, gene trees inferred by traditional phylogenetic methods are unrooted. We investigate probabilities of unrooted gene trees under the multispecies coalescent model. We show that when there are four species with one gene sampled per species, the distribution of unrooted gene tree topologies identifies the unrooted species tree topology and some, but not all, information in the species tree edges (branch lengths). The location of the root on the species tree is not identifiable in this situation. However, for 5 or more species with one gene sampled per species, we show that the distribution of unrooted gene tree topologies identifies the rooted species tree topology and all its internal branch lengths. The length of any pendant branch leading to a leaf of the species tree is also identifiable for any species from which more than one gene is sampled.","Elizabeth S. Allman1, James H.

0,Representation of Markov chains by random maps: existence and regularity conditions,"We systematically investigate the problem of representing Markov chains by families of random maps, and which regularity of these maps can be achieved depending on the properties of the probability measures. Our key idea is to use techniques from optimal transport to select optimal such maps. Optimal transport theory also tells us how convexity properties of the supports of the measures translate into regularity properties of the maps via Legendre transforms. Thus, from this scheme, we cannot only deduce the representation by measurable random maps, but we can also obtain conditions for the representation by continuous random maps. Finally, we present conditions for the representation of Markov chain by random diffeomorphisms.","Jürgen Jost1,2, Martin Kell1 nAff3 & Christian S.

0,Existence and uniqueness of semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions in an orthant,"This work is concerned with the existence and uniqueness of a class of semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions which live in the non-negative orthant of ℝd. Loosely speaking, such a process has a semimartingale decomposition such that in the interior of the orthant the process behaves like a Brownian motion with a constant drift and covariance matrix, and at each of the (d-1)-dimensional faces that form the boundary of the orthant, the bounded variation part of the process increases in a given direction (constant for any particular face) so as to confine the process to the orthant. For historical reasons, this “pushing” at the boundary is called instantaneous reflection. In 1988, Reiman and Williams proved that a necessary condition for the existence of such a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion (SRBM) is that the reflection matrix formed by the directions of reflection be completely-L. In this work we prove that condition is sufficient for the existence of an SRBM and that the SRBM is unique in law. It follows from the uniqueness that an SRBM defines a strong Markov process.

0,Monotonicity of fitness landscapes and mutation rate control,"A common view in evolutionary biology is that mutation rates are minimised. However, studies in combinatorial optimisation and search have shown a clear advantage of using variable mutation rates as a control parameter to optimise the performance of evolutionary algorithms. Much biological theory in this area is based on Ronald Fisher’s work, who used Euclidean geometry to study the relation between mutation size and expected fitness of the offspring in infinite phenotypic spaces. Here we reconsider this theory based on the alternative geometry of discrete and finite spaces of DNA sequences. First, we consider the geometric case of fitness being isomorphic to distance from an optimum, and show how problems of optimal mutation rate control can be solved exactly or approximately depending on additional constraints of the problem. Then we consider the general case of fitness communicating only partial information about the distance. We define weak monotonicity of fitness landscapes and prove that this property holds in all landscapes that are continuous and open at the optimum. This theoretical result motivates our hypothesis that optimal mutation rate functions in such landscapes will increase when fitness decreases in some neighbourhood of an optimum, resembling the control functions derived in the geometric case. We test this hypothesis experimentally by analysing approximately optimal mutation rate control functions in 115 complete landscapes of binding scores between DNA sequences and transcription factors. Our findings support the hypothesis and find that the increase of mutation rate is more rapid in landscapes that are less monotonic (more rugged). We discuss the relevance of these findings to living organisms.","Roman V. Belavkin1, Alastair Channon2, Elizabeth Aston2, John Aston3, Rok Krašovec4 & …Christopher G.

However, most studies of stochastic evolutionary game theory have investigated dynamics of symmetric games, although not all social and biological phenomena are described by symmetric games, e.g., social interactions between individuals having conflicting preferences or different roles. In this paper, we describe the stochastic evolutionary dynamics of two-player \(2 \times 2\) bimatrix games in finite populations. The stochastic process is modeled by a frequency-dependent Moran process without mutation. We obtained the fixation probability that the evolutionary dynamics starting from a given initial state converges to a specific absorbing state. Applying the formula to the ultimatum game, we show that evolutionary dynamics favors fairness. Furthermore, we present two novel concepts of stability for bimatrix games, based on our formula for the fixation probability, and demonstrate that one of the two serves as a criterion for equilibrium selection.","Takuya Sekiguchi1,2 & Hisashi Ohtsuki",Dynamic Games and Applications,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13235-015-0170-2,"Bimatrix games,Equilibrium selection,Finite population,Fixation probability,Stability,Stochastic evolution"

X/G/1 retrial queue with Bernoulli feedback and impatient customers","This paper deals with a discrete-time batch arrival retrial queue with the server subject to starting failures. Different from standard batch arrival retrial queues with starting failures, we assume that each customer after service either immediately returns to the orbit for another service with probability θ or leaves the system forever with probability 1 − θ (0 ≤ θ < 1). On the other hand, if the server is started unsuccessfully by a customer (external or repeated), the server is sent to repair immediately and the customer either joins the orbit with probability q or leaves the system forever with probability 1 − q (0 ≤ q < 1). Firstly, we introduce an embedded Markov chain and obtain the necessary and sufficient condition for ergodicity of this embedded Markov chain. Secondly, we derive the steady-state joint distribution of the server state and the number of customers in the system/orbit at arbitrary time. We also derive a stochastic decomposition law. In the special case of individual arrivals, we develop recursive formulae for calculating the steady-state distribution of the orbit size.

0,A diagnoser algorithm for anomaly detection in DEDS under partial and unreliable observations: characterization and inclusion in sensor configuration optimization,"Complex engineering systems have to be carefully monitored to meet demanding performance requirements, including detecting anomalies in their operations. There are two major monitoring challenges for these systems. The first challenge is that information collected from the monitored system is often partial and/or unreliable, in the sense that some occurred events may not be reported and/or may be reported incorrectly (e.g., reported as another event). The second is that anomalies often consist of sequences of event patterns separated in space and time. This paper introduces and analyzes a diagnoser algorithm that meets these challenges for detecting and counting occurrences of anomalies in engineering systems. The proposed diagnoser algorithm assumes that models are available for characterizing plant operations (via stochastic automata) and sensors (via probabilistic mappings) used for reporting partial and unreliable information. Methods for analyzing the effects of model uncertainties on the diagnoser performance are also discussed. In order to select configurations that reduce sensor costs, while satisfying diagnoser performance requirements, a sensor configuration selection algorithm developed in previous work is then extended for the proposed diagnoser algorithm. The proposed algorithms and methods are then applied to a multi-unit-operation system, which is derived from an actual facility application. Results show that the proposed diagnoser algorithm is able to detect and count occurrences of anomalies accurately and that its performance is robust to model uncertainties. Furthermore, the sensor configuration selection algorithm is able to suggest optimal sensor configurations with significantly reduced costs, while still yielding acceptable performance for counting the occurrences of anomalies.","Wen-Chiao Lin1, Humberto E.

Extending the simulation technique of Griffiths and Tavaré (1996), computational estimation of expected times to the most recent common ancestor of samples of n genes under recombination and selection in two-locus, two-allele haploid and diploid models are presented. Such times are conditional on sample configuration.

0,Scaling limits of the Schelling model,"The Schelling model of segregation, introduced by Schelling in 1969 as a model for residential segregation in cities, describes how populations of multiple types self-organize to form homogeneous clusters of one type. In this model, vertices in an N-dimensional lattice are initially assigned types randomly. As time evolves, the type at a vertex v has a tendency to be replaced with the most common type within distance w of v. We present the first mathematical description of the dynamical scaling limit of this model as w tends to infinity and the lattice is correspondingly rescaled. We do this by deriving an integro-differential equation for the limiting Schelling dynamics and proving almost sure existence and uniqueness of the solutions when the initial conditions are described by white noise. The evolving fields are in some sense very “rough” but we are able to make rigorous sense of the evolution. In a key lemma, we show that for certain Gaussian fields h, the supremum of the occupation density of \(h-\phi \) at zero (taken over all 1-Lipschitz functions \(\phi \)) is almost surely finite, thereby extending a result of Bass and Burdzy. In the one dimensional case, we also describe the scaling limit of the limiting clusters obtained at time infinity, thereby resolving a conjecture of Brandt, Immorlica, Kamath, and Kleinberg.","Nina Holden

0,An explicit representation of the Luria–Delbrück distribution," The probability distribution of the number of mutant cells in a growing single-cell population is presented in explicit form. We use a discrete model for mutation and population growth which in the limit of large cell numbers and small mutation rates reduces to certain classical models of the Luria–Delbrück distribution. Our results hold for arbitrarily large values of the mutation rate and for cell populations of arbitrary size. We discuss the influence of cell death on fluctuation experiments and investigate a version of our model that accounts for the possibility that both daughter cells of a non-mutant cell might be mutants. An algorithm is presented for the quick calculation of the distribution. Then, we focus on the derivation of two essentially different limit laws, the first of which applies if the population size tends to infinity while the mutation rate tends to zero such that the product of mutation rate times population size converges. The second limit law emerges after a suitable rescaling of the distribution of non-mutant cells in the population and applies if the product of mutation rate times population size tends to infinity. We discuss the distribution of mutation events for arbitrary values of the mutation rate and cell populations of arbitrary size, and, finally, consider limit laws for this distribution with respect to the behavior of the product of mutation rate times population size.

0,A generalized Neyman–Pearson lemma for g-probabilities,"This paper is concerned with hypothesis tests for g-probabilities, a class of nonlinear probability measures. The problem is shown to be a special case of a general stochastic optimization problem where the objective is to choose the terminal state of certain backward stochastic differential equations so as to minimize a g-expectation. The latter is solved with a stochastic maximum principle approach. Neyman–Pearson type results are thereby derived for the original problem with both simple and randomized tests. It turns out that the likelihood ratio in the optimal tests is nothing else than the ratio of the adjoint processes associated with the maximum principle. Concrete examples, ranging from the classical simple tests, financial market modelling with ambiguity, to super- and sub-pricing of contingent claims and to risk measures, are presented to illustrate the applications of the results obtained.","Shaolin Ji1 & Xun Yu Zhou2,",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-009-0244-4,"Backward stochastic differential equation,g-probability/expectation,Hypothesis test,Neyman–Pearson lemma,Stochastic maximum principle"

On the other hand, weighted majority functions are shown to be noise-stable. Several necessary and sufficient conditions for noise sensitivity and stability are given.Consider, for example, bond percolation on ann+1 byn grid. A configuration is a function that assigns to every edge the value 0 or 1. Let ω be a random configuration, selected according to the uniform measure. A crossing is a path that joins the left and right sides of the rectangle, and consists entirely of edges ℓ with ω(ℓ)=1. By duality, the probability for having a crossing is 1/2. Fix an ɛ ∈ (0, 1). For each edge ℓ, let ω′(ℓ)=ω(ℓ) with probability 1 − ɛ, and ω′(ℓ)=1 − ω(ℓ) with probability ɛ, independently of the other edges. Letp(τ) be the probability for having a crossing in ω, conditioned on ω′ = τ.

0,Resident-invader dynamics of similar strategies in fluctuating environments,"We study resident-invader dynamics in fluctuating environments when the invader and the resident have close but distinct strategies. First we focus on a class of continuous-time models of unstructured populations of multi-dimensional strategies, which incorporates environmental feedback and environmental stochasticity. Then we generalize our results to a class of structured population models. We classify the generic population dynamical outcomes of an invasion event when the resident population in a given environment is non-growing on the long-run and stochastically persistent. Our approach is based on the series expansion of a model with respect to the small strategy difference, and on the analysis of a stochastic fast-slow system induced by time-scale separation. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that the total size of the resident and invader population varies stochastically and dramatically in time, while the relative size of the invader population changes slowly and asymptotically in time. Thereby the classification is based on the asymptotic behavior of the relative population size, and which is shown to be fully determined by invasion criteria (i.e., without having to study the full generic dynamical system). Our results extend and generalize previous results for a stable resident equilibrium (particularly, Geritz in J Math Biol 50(1):67–82, 2005; Dercole and Geritz in J Theor Biol 394:231-254, 2016) to non-equilibrium resident population dynamics as well as resident dynamics with stochastic (or deterministic) drivers.","Yuhua Cai

Both problems are NP-hard. We write both problems as matrix-rank minimization and then relax them using the nuclear norm. This technique, which may be regarded as a generalization of compressive sensing, has recently been shown to be an effective way to solve rank optimization problems. In the special case that the input graph has a planted clique or biclique (i.e., a single large clique or biclique plus diversionary edges), our algorithm successfully provides an exact solution to the original instance. For each problem, we provide two analyses of when our algorithm succeeds. In the first analysis, the diversionary edges are placed by an adversary. In the second, they are placed at random.

This algorithm has the highly desirable property of solving a large class of global optimization problems using a number of iterations that increases at most linearly in the dimension of the problem. Unfortunately, PAS has remained of mostly theoretical interest due to the difficulty of generating, in each iteration, a point uniformly distributed in the improving feasible region. In this article, we derive a coupling equivalence between generating an approximately uniformly distributed point using Markov chain sampling, and generating an exactly uniformly distributed point with a certain probability. This result is used to characterize the complexity of a PAS-implementation as a function of (a) the number of iterations required by PAS to achieve a certain solution quality guarantee, and (b) the complexity of the sampling algorithm used. As an application, we use this equivalence to show that PAS, using the so-called Random ball walk Markov chain sampling method for generating nearly uniform points in a convex region, can be used to solve most convex programming problems in polynomial time.","Daniel J.

Time consistency is a crucial property for dynamic risk measures. Making use of the dual representation for conditional risk measures, we characterize the time consistency by a cocycle condition for the minimal penalty function.

Taking advantage of this cocycle condition, we introduce a new methodology for the construction of time-consistent dynamic risk measures. Starting with BMO martingales, we provide new classes of time-consistent dynamic risk measures. These families generalize those obtained from backward stochastic differential equations. Quite importantly, starting with right-continuous BMO martingales, this construction naturally leads to paths with jumps.

Building on previous work utilising the group algebra of the symmetric group, we explicitly construct the genome algebra for the case of unsigned circular genomes with dihedral symmetry and show that the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of genome rearrangement distance can be validly and more efficiently performed in this setting. We then construct the genome algebra for a more general case, that is, for genomes that may be represented by elements of an arbitrary group and symmetry group, and show that the MLE computations can be performed entirely within this framework. There is no prescribed model in this framework; that is, it allows any choice of rearrangements that preserve the set of regions, along with arbitrary weights. Further, since the likelihood function is built from path probabilities—a generalisation of path counts—the framework may be utilised for any distance measure that is based on path probabilities.

Secreted molecules are known to have a migratory effect, but it remains unclear whether such molecules act as directional guidance cues or as motility regulators. There is potential to use signalling molecules in new medical therapies, so it is important to identify the exact role these molecules play. This paper focuses on distinguishing between inhibitory and repulsive effects produced by signalling molecules, based on recent experiments examining the effect of Slit, a secreted protein, on the migration of neurons from the brain. The primary role of Slit, whether it is an inhibitor or repellent of neurons, is in dispute. We present population-level continuum models and recast these in terms of transition probabilities governing individual cells. Various cell-sensing strategies are considered within this framework. The models are applied to the neuronal migration experiments. To resolve the particular role of Slit, simulations of the models characterising different cell-sensing strategies are compared at the population and individual cell level, providing two complementary perspectives on the system.

0,Spectra of Large Random Trees,"We analyze the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices of a wide variety of random trees. Using general, broadly applicable arguments based on the interlacing inequalities for the eigenvalues of a principal submatrix of a Hermitian matrix and a suitable notion of local weak convergence for an ensemble of random trees that we call probability fringe convergence, we show that the empirical spectral distributions for many random tree models converge to a deterministic (model-dependent) limit as the number of vertices goes to infinity.Moreover, the masses assigned by the empirical spectral distributions to individual points also converge in distribution to constants. We conclude for ensembles such as the linear preferential attachment models, random recursive trees, and the uniform random trees that the limiting spectral distribution has a set of atoms that is dense in the real line. We obtain lower bounds on the mass assigned to zero by the empirical spectral measures via the connection between the number of zero eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of a tree and the cardinality of a maximal matching on the tree. In particular, we employ a simplified version of an algorithm due to Karp and Sipser to construct maximal matchings and understand their properties. Moreover, we show that the total weight of a weighted matching is asymptotically equivalent to a constant multiple of the number of vertices when the edge weights are independent, identically distributed, nonnegative random variables with finite expected value, thereby significantly extending a result obtained by Aldous and Steele in the special case of uniform random trees.We greatly generalize a celebrated result obtained by Schwenk for the uniform random trees by showing that if any ensemble converges in the probability fringe sense and a very mild further condition holds, then, with probability converging to one, the spectrum of a realization is shared by at least one other (nonisomorphic) tree.For the linear preferential attachment model with parameter a>−1, we show that for any fixed k, the k largest eigenvalues jointly converge in distribution to a nontrivial limit when rescaled by \(n^{1/2\gamma_{a}}\), where γ

These, in turn, necessitate increasingly elaborate numerical methods as well as dedicated algorithms capable of resolving each detail which they account for. Especially when commercial software is used, the performance of the algorithms coded by the user must be tested and carefully assessed. In Computational Biomechanics, the Spherical Design Algorithm (SDA) is a widely used algorithm to model biological tissues that, like articular cartilage, are described as composites reinforced by statistically oriented collagen fibres. The purpose of the present work is to analyse the performances of the SDA, which we implement in a commercial software for several sets of integration points (referred to as “spherical designs”), and compare the results with those determined by using an appropriate set of points proposed in this manuscript. As terms for comparison we take the results obtained by employing the integration scheme Integral, available in Matlab\(^{{\textregistered }}\). For the numerical simulations, we study a well-documented benchmark test on articular cartilage, known as ‘unconfined compression test’.

We define a class of “algebraic” random matrices. These are random matrices for which the Stieltjes transform of the limiting eigenvalue distribution function is algebraic, i.e., it satisfies a (bivariate) polynomial equation. The Wigner and Wishart matrices whose limiting eigenvalue distributions are given by the semicircle law and the Marčenko–Pastur law are special cases.

Algebraicity of a random matrix sequence is shown to act as a certificate of the computability of the limiting eigenvalue density function. The limiting moments of algebraic random matrix sequences, when they exist, are shown to satisfy a finite depth linear recursion so that they may often be efficiently enumerated in closed form.

In this article, we develop the mathematics of the polynomial method which allows us to describe the class of algebraic matrices by its generators and map the constructive approach we employ when proving algebraicity into a software implementation that is available for download in the form of the RMTool random matrix “calculator” package. Our characterization of the closure of algebraic probability distributions under free additive and multiplicative convolution operations allows us to simultaneously establish a framework for computational (noncommutative) “free probability” theory. We hope that the tools developed allow researchers to finally harness the power of infinite random matrix theory.

The general theory is applied to three specific models: the estimation of the center of symmetry of a symmetric function in Gaussian white noise, a time-discrete functional data analysis model and Cox’s proportional hazards model.

0,Routing optimization with time windows under uncertainty,"We study an a priori Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows (tsptw) in which the travel times along the arcs are uncertain and the goal is to determine within a budget constraint, a route for the service vehicle in order to arrive at the customers’ locations within their stipulated time windows as well as possible. In particular, service at customer’s location cannot commence before the beginning of the time window and any arrival after the end of the time window is considered late and constitutes to poor customer service. In articulating the service level of the tsptw under uncertainty, we propose a new decision criterion, called the essential riskiness index, which has the computationally attractive feature of convexity that enables us to formulate and solve the problem more effectively. As a decision criterion for articulating service levels, it takes into account both the probability of lateness and its magnitude, and can be applied in contexts where either the distributional information of the uncertain travel times is fully or partially known. We propose a new formulation for the tsptw, where we explicitly express the service starting time at each customer’s location as a convex piecewise affine function of the travel times, which would enable us to obtain the tractable formulation of the corresponding distributionally robust problem. We also show how to optimize the essential riskiness index via Benders decomposition and present cases where we can obtain closed-form solutions to the subproblems. We also illustrate in our numerical studies that this approach scales well with the number of samples used for the sample average approximation. The approach can be extended to a more general setting including Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows with uncertain travel times and customers’ demands.","Yu Zhang1,2, Roberto Baldacci

0,Neighborhood search approaches to beam orientation optimization in intensity modulated radiation therapy treatment planning,"The intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning problem consists of several subproblems which are typically solved sequentially. We seek to combine two of the subproblems: the beam orientation optimization (BOO) problem and the fluence map optimization (FMO) problem. The BOO problem is the problem of selecting the beam orientations to deliver radiation to the patient. The FMO problem is the problem of determining the amount of radiation intensity, or fluence, of each beamlet in each beam. The solution to the FMO problem measures the quality of a beam set, but the majority of previous BOO studies rely on heuristics and approximations to gauge the quality of the beam set. In contrast with these studies, we use an exact measure of the treatment plan quality attainable using a given beam set, which ensures convergence to a global optimum in the case of our simulated annealing algorithm and a local optimum in the case of our local search algorithm. We have also developed a new neighborhood structure that allows for faster convergence using our simulated annealing and local search algorithms, thus reducing the amount of time required to obtain a good solution. Finally, we show empirically that we can generate clinically acceptable treatment plans that require fewer beams than in current practice.

0,The distance exponent for Liouville first passage percolation is positive,"Discrete Liouville first passage percolation (LFPP) with parameter \(\xi > 0\) is the random metric on a sub-graph of \(\mathbb Z^2\) obtained by assigning each vertex z a weight of \(e^{\xi h(z)}\), where h is the discrete Gaussian free field. We show that the distance exponent for discrete LFPP is strictly positive for all \(\xi > 0\). More precisely, the discrete LFPP distance between the inner and outer boundaries of a discrete annulus of size \(2^n\) is typically at least \(2^{\alpha n}\) for an exponent \(\alpha > 0\) depending on \(\xi \). This is a crucial input in the proof that LFPP admits non-trivial subsequential scaling limits for all \(\xi > 0\) and also has theoretical implications for the study of distances in Liouville quantum gravity.

0,On the algorithmic solution of optimization problems subject to probabilistic/robust (probust) constraints,"We present an adaptive grid refinement algorithm to solve probabilistic optimization problems with infinitely many random constraints. Using a bilevel approach, we iteratively aggregate inequalities that provide most information not in a geometric but in a probabilistic sense. This conceptual idea, for which a convergence proof is provided, is then adapted to an implementable algorithm. The efficiency of our approach when compared to naive methods based on uniform grid refinement is illustrated for a numerical test example as well as for a water reservoir problem with joint probabilistic filling level constraints.

0,The limiting behaviour of a mainland-island metapopulation,Stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs) are a class of discrete time Markov chains used to model the presence/absence of a population in a collection of habitat patches. This class of model is popular with ecologists due to its ability to incorporate important factors of the habitat patch network such as connectivity and distance between patches as well as heterogeneity in patch characteristics. We present an asymptotic examination of a simple type of SPOM called the mainland-island model. In this model a single patch called the mainland is connected to a large number of smaller patches called islands and each island is only connected to the mainland. We discuss the limiting behaviour of the SPOM as the number of islands increases and the size of the islands decrease relative to the mainland. We demonstrate that a variety of limiting behaviours is possible depending on the scaling of the island size and on the heterogeneity of habitat quality.,R. McVinish1 & P. K.

Since jumps in electricity dynamics are directly related to the regime switch, we model them via the chain itself and consider a regime switching model for electricity spot price dynamic. Next, we determine an equivalent measure by Esscher transform and through it we evaluate the electricity forwards and risk premium. We apply expectation maximization algorithm to estimate parameters of the model. Furthermore, we use the real data of Nord Pool market to calibration of the proposed model.

We prove a reformulated complementarity problem based on a fixed-point representation of equilibrium prices improves computational reliability and provide computational evidence of its efficiency on an empirically-relevant problem. Scientific inferences from empirical Bertrand competition models with explicit limits on individual purchasing power will benefit significantly from our proposed methods for computing equilibrium prices. An analysis of floating-point computations also implies that any model will have finite purchasing power when implemented on existing computing machines, and thus the techniques discussed here have general value.

This paper gives conditions for a law of the iterated logarithm for U-statistics which have a kernel with an estimator substituted into it. It also gives conditions for both strong and weak convergence. Applications of the theory are illustrated by constructing a sequential test for scale differences with power one. The theory also produces convergence results for adaptive M-estimators and for cross-validation assessment statistics. In addition, it is shown how to extend LIL results to a broad class of statistics with estimators substituted into them by use of the differential. In particular, a law of the iterated logarithm is described for adaptive L-statistics and is illustrated by an example of de Wet and van Wyk (1979).",H. K. Iverson1 & R. H.

The first combinatorial ingredient is an encoding of quadrangulations by trees embedded in the positive half-line, reminiscent of Cori and Vauquelin’s well labelled trees. The second step relates these trees to embedded (discrete) trees in the sense of Aldous, via the conjugation of tree principle, an analogue for trees of Vervaat’s construction of the Brownian excursion from the bridge.

0,A search for quantum coin-flipping protocols using optimization techniques,"Coin-flipping is a cryptographic task in which two physically separated, mistrustful parties wish to generate a fair coin-flip by communicating with each other. Chailloux and Kerenidis (2009) designed quantum protocols that guarantee coin-flips with near optimal bias away from uniform, even when one party deviates arbitrarily from the protocol. The probability of any outcome in these protocols is provably at most \(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \delta \) for any given \(\delta > 0\). However, no explicit description of these protocols is known; in fact, the smallest bias achieved by known explicit protocols is \(1/4\) (Ambainis 2001). We take a computational optimization approach, based mostly on convex optimization, to the search for simple and explicit quantum strong coin-flipping protocols. We present a search algorithm to identify protocols with low bias within a natural class, protocols based on bit-commitment (Nayak and Shor in Phys Rev A 67(1):012304, 2003). The techniques we develop enable a computational search for protocols given by a mesh over the corresponding parameter space. We conduct searches for four-round and six-round protocols with bias below \(0.2499\) each of varying dimension which include the best known explicit protocol (with bias \(1/4\)). After checking over \(10^{16}\) protocols, a task which would be infeasible using semidefinite programming alone, we conjecture that the smallest achievable bias within the family of protocols we consider is \(1/4\).","Ashwin Nayak1, Jamie Sikora

We propose a way of applying the wavelet transform in coding theory. Wavelet analysis is a special type of linear transformation of signals and physical data on the basis of which it is possible to construct a linear code. The error protection schemes, based on linear codes, do not provide the same level of protection against all possible errors, but concentrate their detecting abilities on a specific set of errors. This dependence of the abilities of a linear code on the distribution of errors may distort the data to be protected in the case when the error does not belong to the set of undetectable errors. To reduce the probability of error masking, the robust codes are used. Robust codes are nonlinear codes independent of the type and dimension of the error.

0,"When do birds of a feather flock together? k-Means, proximity, and conic programming","Given a set of data, one central goal is to group them into clusters based on some notion of similarity between the individual objects. One of the most popular and widely-used approaches is k-means despite the computational hardness to find its global minimum. We study and compare the properties of different convex relaxations by relating them to corresponding proximity conditions, an idea originally introduced by Kumar and Kannan. Using conic duality theory, we present an improved proximity condition under which the Peng–Wei relaxation of k-means recovers the underlying clusters exactly. Our proximity condition improves upon Kumar and Kannan and is comparable to that of Awashti and Sheffet, where proximity conditions are established for projective k-means. In addition, we provide a necessary proximity condition for the exactness of the Peng–Wei relaxation. For the special case of equal cluster sizes, we establish a different and completely localized proximity condition under which the Amini–Levina relaxation yields exact clustering, thereby having addressed an open problem by Awasthi and Sheffet in the balanced case. Our framework is not only deterministic and model-free but also comes with a clear geometric meaning which allows for further analysis and generalization. Moreover, it can be conveniently applied to analyzing various data generative models such as the stochastic ball models and Gaussian mixture models. With this method, we improve the current minimum separation bound for the stochastic ball models and achieve the state-of-the-art results of learning Gaussian mixture models.","Xiaodong Li1, Yang Li

0,Koopman-Based Spectral Clustering of Directed and Time-Evolving Graphs,"AbstractWhile spectral clustering algorithms for undirected graphs are well established and have been successfully applied to unsupervised machine learning problems ranging from image segmentation and genome sequencing to signal processing and social network analysis, clustering directed graphs remains notoriously difficult. Two of the main challenges are that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of graph Laplacians associated with directed graphs are in general complex-valued and that there is no universally accepted definition of clusters in directed graphs. We first exploit relationships between the graph Laplacian and transfer operators and in particular between clusters in undirected graphs and metastable sets in stochastic dynamical systems and then use a generalization of the notion of metastability to derive clustering algorithms for directed and time-evolving graphs. The resulting clusters can be interpreted as coherent sets, which play an important role in the analysis of transport and mixing processes in fluid flows.

Therefore, we can define a “rectangular-free convolution”, which allows to deduce the singular values of the sum of two large independent rectangular random matrices from the individual singular values. This convolution is linearized by cumulants and by an analytic integral transform, that we called the “rectangular R-transform”.",Florent Benaych-Georges,Probability Theory and Related Fields,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-008-0152-z,"Random matrices,Free probability,Free convolution"

0,Forecasting mortality: when academia meets practice,"Techniques used in practice often differ from tools developed in academia. The lack of communication that may exist between academia and practice can then have important consequences for many insurance companies or pension funds. This issue is illustrated with what is currently happening in Switzerland. Swiss pension funds use mortality tables that are regularly updated with new observations. A new version of these tables has been recently published and includes a procedure to forecast mortality until 2150. The method applied for these projections is very different from the several forecasting models that have been developed in academia over the last decades. In this paper, we compare mortality forecasts used by practitioners in Switzerland and the forecasts resulting from two simple approaches well-known in academia, the Lee–Carter model and the Heligman–Pollard function. These two approaches have the advantage of simplicity and thus, all insurance companies and pension funds may implement them without any difficulties. The analysis demonstrates that both academic methods forecast a more important decrease in mortality than the approach applied by pension funds, especially in the long-run and for females. Impacts on pension liabilities are then evaluated, enlightening the future challenges many institutions will face. Finally, a few points which insurance companies or pension funds need to be cautious with, when using mortality forecasts, are summarized.",Séverine Gaille,European Actuarial Journal,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13385-011-0044-y,"Mortality forecasts,Pension fund liabilities,Switzerland,LPP 2010,Lee–Carter model,Heligman–Pollard function"
0,Nonlinear chance-constrained problems with applications to hydro scheduling,"We present a Branch-and-Cut algorithm for a class of nonlinear chance-constrained mathematical optimization problems with a finite number of scenarios. Unsatisfied scenarios can enter a recovery mode. This class corresponds to problems that can be reformulated as deterministic convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems with indicator variables and continuous scenario variables, but the size of the reformulation is large and quickly becomes impractical as the number of scenarios grows. The Branch-and-Cut algorithm is based on an implicit Benders decomposition scheme, where we generate cutting planes as outer approximation cuts from the projection of the feasible region on suitable subspaces. The size of the master problem in our scheme is much smaller than the deterministic reformulation of the chance-constrained problem. We apply the Branch-and-Cut algorithm to the mid-term hydro scheduling problem, for which we propose a chance-constrained formulation. A computational study using data from ten hydroplants in Greece shows that the proposed methodology solves instances faster than applying a general-purpose solver for convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems to the deterministic reformulation, and scales much better with the number of scenarios.","Andrea Lodi

0,Risk bounds for model selection via penalization," Performance bounds for criteria for model selection are developed using recent theory for sieves. The model selection criteria are based on an empirical loss or contrast function with an added penalty term motivated by empirical process theory and roughly proportional to the number of parameters needed to describe the model divided by the number of observations. Most of our examples involve density or regression estimation settings and we focus on the problem of estimating the unknown density or regression function. We show that the quadratic risk of the minimum penalized empirical contrast estimator is bounded by an index of the accuracy of the sieve. This accuracy index quantifies the trade-off among the candidate models between the approximation error and parameter dimension relative to sample size.If we choose a list of models which exhibit good approximation properties with respect to different classes of smoothness, the estimator can be simultaneously minimax rate optimal in each of those classes. This is what is usually called adaptation. The type of classes of smoothness in which one gets adaptation depends heavily on the list of models. If too many models are involved in order to get accurate approximation of many wide classes of functions simultaneously, it may happen that the estimator is only approximately adaptive (typically up to a slowly varying function of the sample size).We shall provide various illustrations of our method such as penalized maximum likelihood, projection or least squares estimation. The models will involve commonly used finite dimensional expansions such as piecewise polynomials with fixed or variable knots, trigonometric polynomials, wavelets, neural nets and related nonlinear expansions defined by superposition of ridge functions.","Andrew Barron1, Lucien Birgé2 & Pascal Massart",Probability Theory and Related Fields,1999,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004400050210,"Mathematics subject classifications (1991): Primary 62G05, 62G07; secondary 41A25"

0,A germ-grain model applied to the morphological study of dual phase steel,"The mechanical properties of dual Phase steels (DP steels) are strictly related to the spatial distribution and the geometry of the two phases composing the steel, ferrite and martensite. Due to the high costs to obtain images of sections of steel samples, one important industrial problem is the reduction of the number of 2D sections needed to build and simulate a geometric model which may reproduce in a realistic way the 3D geometry of the material. In this context, the availability of suitable techniques of parameter estimation or identification is fundamental to solve the problem.In this work we present a germ-grain model which approximates the main geometric characteristics of the martensite, taking into account the inhomogeneities of the material. The parameters of the model are estimated on the basis of the morphological characteristics of the images of about 150 tomographic sections of a real sample, quantified by the Minkowski functionals. Here we replace the Mahalanobis distance, introduced in previous literature, with the \(\mathcal{N}\)-distance, which provides computational advantages. In order to test if the estimated model is reproducing the distribution of the Minkowski functionals of the real material, both confidence bands from the simulated model are computed and compared with the real data and techniques for the detection of functional outliers are applied to quantify the accuracy of fit of the estimated model.","Alessandra Micheletti

0,Evolutionary bet-hedging in structured populations,"As ecosystems evolve, species can become extinct due to fluctuations in the environment. This leads to the evolutionary adaption known as bet-hedging, where species hedge against these fluctuations to reduce their likelihood of extinction. Environmental variation can be either within or between generations. Previous work has shown that selection for bet-hedging against within-generational variation should not occur in large populations. However, this work has been limited by assumptions of well-mixed populations, whereas real populations usually have some degree of structure. Using the framework of evolutionary graph theory, we show that through adding competition structure to the population, within-generational variation can have a significant impact on the evolutionary process for any population size. This complements research using subdivided populations, which suggests that within-generational variation is important when local population sizes are small. Together, these conclusions provide evidence to support observations by some ecologists that are contrary to the widely held view that only between-generational environmental variation has an impact on natural selection. This provides theoretical justification for further empirical study into this largely unexplored area.","Christopher E. Overton

The asymptotic form of its density is obtained when either the hitting time or the starting site ((B˙0)) becomes large. Our results entail that if Brownian motion is started at ((x)) and conditioned to hit ((U(a))), at time t, the distribution of the hitting site approaches the uniform distribution or the point mass at ((ax/—x—)) according as ((—x—/t)) tends to zero or infinity; in each case we provide a precise asymptotic estimate of the density. In the case when ((—x—/t)) tends to a positive constant we show the convergence of the density and derive an analytic expression of the limit density.","Kôhei Uchiyama

0,Signatures of universal characteristics of fractal fluctuations in global mean monthly temperature anomalies,This paper proposes a general systems theory for fractals visualising the emergence of successively larger scale fluctuations resulting from the space-time integration of enclosed smaller scale fluctuations. Global gridded time series data sets of monthly mean temperatures for the period 1880–2007/2008 are analysed to show that data sets and corresponding power spectra exhibit distributions close to the model predicted inverse power law distribution. The model predicted and observed universal spectrum for interannual variability rules out linear secular trends in global monthly mean temperatures.

0,Ergodic Theorems for Laminations and Foliations: Recent Results and Perspectives,"This report discusses recent results as well as new perspectives in the ergodic theory for Riemann surface laminations, with an emphasis on singular holomorphic foliations by curves. The central notions of these developments are leafwise Poincaré metric, directed positive harmonic currents, multiplicative cocycles, and Lyapunov exponents. We deal with various ergodic theorems for such laminations: random and operator ergodic theorems, (geometric) Birkhoff ergodic theorems, Oseledec multiplicative ergodic theorem, and unique ergodicity theorems. Applications of these theorems are also given. In particular, we define and study the canonical Lyapunov exponents for a large family of singular holomorphic foliations on compact projective surfaces. Topological and algebro-geometric interpretations of these characteristic numbers are also treated. These results highlight the strong similarity as well as the fundamental differences between the ergodic theory of maps and that of Riemann surface laminations. Most of the results reported here are known. However, sufficient conditions for abstract heat diffusions to coincide with the leafwise heat diffusions (Section 5.2) are new ones.","Viêt-Anh Nguyên1,",Acta Mathematica Vietnamica,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40306-020-00380-4,"Riemann surface lamination,Singular holomorphic foliation,Leafwise Poincaré metric,Positive harmonic currents,Multiplicative cocycles,Ergodic theorems,Lyapunov exponents"
0,A theory of Fisher's reproductive value,"The formal Darwinism project aims to provide a mathematically rigorous basis for optimisation thinking in relation to natural selection. This paper deals with the situation in which individuals in a population belong to classes, such as sexes, or size and/or age classes. Fisher introduced the concept of reproductive value into biology to help analyse evolutionary processes of populations divided into classes. Here a rigorously defined and very general structure justifies, and shows the unity of concept behind, Fisher's uses of reproductive value as measuring the significance for evolutionary processes of (i) an individual and (ii) a class; (iii) recursively, as calculable for a parent as a sum of its shares in the reproductive values of its offspring; and (iv) as an evolutionary maximand under natural selection. The maximand is the same for all parental classes, and is a weighted sum of offspring numbers, which implies that a tradeoff in one aspect of the phenotype can legitimately be studied separately from other aspects. The Price equation, measure theory, Markov theory and positive operators contribute to the framework, which is then applied to a number of examples, including a new and fully rigorous version of Fisher's sex ratio argument. Classes may be discrete (e.g. sex), continuous (e.g. weight at fledging) or multidimensional with discrete and continuous components (e.g. sex and weight at fledging and adult tarsus length).",Alan Grafen,Journal of Mathematical Biology,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-006-0376-4,"Reproductive Value,R.A.

A two-operator state defined on the extended Hilbert space is introduced to describe a property of a postselected quantum system. By imposing some conditions on the two-operator state, it reduces to the previously introduced quantities such as the two-vector state, the W-operator, the connection state and the 2-time quantum state. The correlation included in the two-operator state is clarified. Furthermore, time evolution of a postselected quantum system influenced by a Markovian environment is investigated. The linear response to an external field is also discussed.

0,Alignment Properties in Ordinal Comparison of Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,"In the design and optimization of discrete event dynamic systems, it is often necessary to order alternative designs based on their relative performance, i.e., to rank them from best to worst. In this paper, alignment of observed performance orders with true orders is considered and properties of the alignment are investigated. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is a measure of agreement between the observed performance orders and the true ones. It is shown that Spearman's coefficient converges exponentially in the simulation time or observation time, which gives a strong evidence of the efficiency of order comparison for discrete event dynamic systems. In the context of simulation, the effect of simulation dependence on the alignment is also discussed. It is found that neither independent simulation nor the scheme of common random numbers (CRN), a popular scheme for variance reduction, can yield dominant performance. Finally, numerical examples based on a networking optimization problem are provided to illustrate the convergence of Spearman's coefficient. In these examples, the standard clock (SC) simulation technique provides much faster convergence than either independent simulations or CRN simulations. Both the SC and CRN methods use the same random number sequence to drive many events in parallel; however, under SC the events driving the parallel experiments are all identical, whereas under CRN they may be different.",Liyi Dai1 & Jeffrey E.

Even earlier, Nernst had developed a quantum theory of rotating diatomic gas molecules that figured in the discussions at the first Solvay conference in late 1911. Between 1913 and 1925, Albert Einstein, Paul Ehrenfest, Max Planck, Fritz Reiche, and Erwin Schrödinger, among many others, attempted theoretical descriptions of the rotational specific heat of hydrogen, with only limited success. Quantum theory also was central to the study of molecular spectra, where initially it was more successful. Moreover, the two problems interacted in sometimes surprising ways. Not until 1927, following Werner Heisenberg’s discovery of the behavior of indistinguishable particles in modern quantum mechanics, did American theorist David Dennison find a successful theory of the specific heat of hydrogen.",Clayton A.

0,Mathematical Models of Memory CD8+ T-Cell Repertoire Dynamics in Response to Viral Infections,"Immunity to diseases is conferred by pathogen-specific memory cells that prevent disease reoccurrences. A broad repertoire of memory T-cells must be developed and maintained to effectively protect against viral invasions; yet, the total number of memory T-cells is constrained between infections. Thus, creating memory to new infections can require attrition of some existing memory cells. Furthermore, some viruses induce memory T-cell death early in an infection, after which surviving cells proliferate to refill the memory compartment.We develop mathematical models of cellular attrition and proliferation in order to examine how new viral infections impact existing immunity. With these probabilistic models, we qualitatively and quantitatively predict how the composition and diversity of the memory repertoire changes as a result of viral infections. In addition, we calculate how often immunity to prior diseases is lost due to new infections. Comparing our results across multiple general infection types allows us to draw conclusions about, which types of viral effects most drastically alter existing immunity. We find that early memory attrition does not permanently alter the repertoire composition, while infections that spark substantial new memory generation drastically shift the repertoire and hasten the decline of existing immunity.",Courtney L.

We found that in the spatial model, the probability of fixation of advantageous and disadvantageous mutants is lower, and the rate of generation of double-hit mutants (the so-called tunneling rate) is higher, compared to those for the space-free model. This means that the results previously obtained for space-free models give an underestimation for rates of cancer initiation in the case where the first event is the generation of a double-hit mutant, e.g. the inactivation of a tumor-suppressor gene.",Natalia L.

Results from in silico experiments show the stiffness of cells and the proportions of cell subpopulations affect the nature of deformation in the epithelial layer.

0,Metastability in stochastic dynamics of disordered mean-field models," We study a class of Markov chains that describe reversible stochastic dynamics of a large class of disordered mean field models at low temperatures. Our main purpose is to give a precise relation between the metastable time scales in the problem to the properties of the rate functions of the corresponding Gibbs measures. We derive the analog of the Wentzell-Freidlin theory in this case, showing that any transition can be decomposed, with probability exponentially close to one, into a deterministic sequence of “admissible transitions”. For these admissible transitions we give upper and lower bounds on the expected transition times that differ only by a constant factor. The distributions of the rescaled transition times are shown to converge to the exponential distribution. We exemplify our results in the context of the random field Curie-Weiss model.","Anton Bovier1, Michael Eckhoff2, Véronique Gayrard3 & …Markus Klein",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00012740,"Mathematics Subject Classification (2000): 82C44, 60K35"

The population size is assumed to be large and the mutation rate small. We prove that under a good combination of these two scales, the population process is approximated in the long time scale of mutations by a Markov pure jump process describing the successive trait equilibria of the population. This process, which generalizes the so-called trait substitution sequence (TSS), is called polymorphic evolution sequence (PES). Then we introduce a scaling of the size of mutations and we study the PES in the limit of small mutations. From this study in the neighborhood of evolutionary singularities, we obtain a full mathematical justification of a heuristic criterion for the phenomenon of evolutionary branching. This phenomenon corresponds to the situation where the population, initially essentially single modal, is driven by the selective forces to divide into two separate subpopulations.

If there is at least one customer in the orbit at the end of a vacation, the server begins to serve the new arrivals or the arriving customers from the orbit. For this model, the authors focus on the steady-state analysis for the considered queueing system. Firstly, the authors obtain the generating functions of the number of customers in the orbit and in the system. Then, the authors obtain the closed-form expressions of some performance measures of the system and also give a stochastic decomposition result for the system size.

0,Reduction of a stochastic model of gene expression: Lagrangian dynamics gives access to basins of attraction as cell types and metastabilty,"Differentiation is the process whereby a cell acquires a specific phenotype, by differential gene expression as a function of time. This is thought to result from the dynamical functioning of an underlying Gene Regulatory Network (GRN). The precise path from the stochastic GRN behavior to the resulting cell state is still an open question. In this work we propose to reduce a stochastic model of gene expression, where a cell is represented by a vector in a continuous space of gene expression, to a discrete coarse-grained model on a limited number of cell types. We develop analytical results and numerical tools to perform this reduction for a specific model characterizing the evolution of a cell by a system of piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMP). Solving a spectral problem, we find the explicit variational form of the rate function associated to a large deviations principle, for any number of genes. The resulting Lagrangian dynamics allows us to define a deterministic limit of which the basins of attraction can be identified to cellular types. In this context the quasipotential, describing the transitions between these basins in the weak noise limit, can be defined as the unique solution of an Hamilton–Jacobi equation under a particular constraint. We develop a numerical method for approximating the coarse-grained model parameters, and show its accuracy for a symmetric toggle-switch network. We deduce from the reduced model an approximation of the stationary distribution of the PDMP system, which appears as a Beta mixture. Altogether those results establish a rigorous frame for connecting GRN behavior to the resulting cellular behavior, including the calculation of the probability of jumps between cell types.","Elias Ventre

For the present review we have chosen the results concerning tomography (or stereology) of random processes of lines, random tessellations (mosaics) and Boolean models (not necessarily Poisson) in the plane. The results are obtained either under the assumption of invariance with respect to the group T of translations, or the group M of the Euclidean motions of ℝ2. In each case the marked point processes {P

i
. In the case of random line processes, these approaches lead to differential relations between the joint probabilities for the numbers of intersections that occur in disjoint intervals on a test line having direction α, and the first and the second order Palm probabilities of the similar events. By an analysis of these relations, conditions of Poissonity of n-dimensional distributions for any n ≥ 1 are derived.

Many of these applications have natural multi-marginal extensions leading to the (optimal) multi-marginal Skorokhod problem. Some of the first papers to consider this problem are Brown et al.

However, this turns out to be difficult using existing techniques: only recently a complete solution was be obtained in Cox et al. (Probab Theory Relat Fields 173:211–259, 2018) establishing an extension of the Root construction, while other instances are only partially answered or remain wide open. In this paper, we extend the theory developed in Beiglböck et al. (Invent Math 208(2):327–400, 2017) to the multi-marginal setup which is comparable to the extension of the optimal transport problem to the multi-marginal optimal transport problem. As for the one-marginal case, this viewpoint turns out to be very powerful. In particular, we are able to show that all classical optimal embeddings have natural multi-marginal counterparts. Notably these different constructions are linked through a joint geometric structure and the classical solutions are recovered as particular cases. Moreover, our results also have consequences for the study of the martingale transport problem as well as the peacock problem.","Mathias Beiglböck1, Alexander M. G. Cox

0,Sublinear search spaces for shortest path planning in grid and road networks,"Shortest path planning is a fundamental building block in many applications. Hence developing efficient methods for computing shortest paths in, e.g., road or grid networks is an important challenge. The most successful techniques for fast query answering rely on preprocessing. However, for many of these techniques it is not fully understood why they perform so remarkably well, and theoretical justification for the empirical results is missing. An attempt to explain the excellent practical performance of preprocessing based techniques on road networks (as transit nodes, hub labels, or contraction hierarchies) in a sound theoretical way are parametrized analyses, e.g., considering the highway dimension or skeleton dimension of a graph. Still, these parameters may be large in case the network contains grid-like substructures—which inarguably is the case for real-world road networks around the globe. In this paper, we use the very intuitive notion of bounded growth graphs to describe road networks and also grid graphs. We show that this model suffices to prove sublinear search spaces for the three above mentioned state-of-the-art shortest path planning techniques. Furthermore, our preprocessing methods are close to the ones used in practice and only require expected polynomial time.","Johannes Blum

0,Constructive Regularization of the Random Matrix Norm,"We study the structure of \(n \times n\) random matrices with centered i.i.d. entries having only two finite moments. In the recent joint work with R. Vershynin, we have shown that the operator norm of such matrix A can be reduced to the optimal order \(O(\sqrt{n})\) with high probability by zeroing out a small submatrix of A, but did not describe the structure of this “bad” submatrix nor provide a constructive way to find it. In the current paper, we give a very simple description of a small “bad” subset of entries. We show that it is enough to zero out a small fraction of the rows and columns of A with largest \(L_2\) norms to bring the operator norm of A to the almost optimal order \(O(\sqrt{n \log \log n})\), under additional assumption that the matrix entries are symmetrically distributed. As a corollary, we also obtain a constructive procedure to find a small submatrix of A that one can zero out to achieve the same norm regularization. The main component of the proof is the development of techniques extending constructive regularization approaches known for the Bernoulli matrices (from the works of Feige and Ofek, and Le, Levina and Vershynin) to the considerably broader class of heavy-tailed random matrices.","Elizaveta Rebrova

This has mainly been caused by a higher penetration of renewable energy generation that is encouraged and enforced by the market and policy makers. In this paper, we propose a two-stage stochastic and distributionally robust modeling framework for the unit commitment problem with supply uncertainty. Based on the availability of the information on the distribution of the random supply, we consider two specific models: (a) a moment model where the mean values of the random supply variables are known, and (b) a mixture distribution model where the true probability distribution lies within the convex hull of a finite set of known distributions. In each case, we reformulate these models through Lagrange dualization as a semi-infinite program in the former case and a one-stage stochastic program in the latter case. We solve the reformulated models using sampling method and sample average approximation, respectively. We also establish exponential rate of convergence of the optimal value when the randomization scheme is applied to discretize the semi-infinite constraints. The proposed robust unit commitment models are applied to an illustrative case study, and numerical test results are reported in comparison with the two-stage non-robust stochastic programming model.","Arash Gourtani1, Huifu Xu2, David Pozo3 & …Tri-Dung Nguyen",Mathematical Methods of Operations Research,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00186-016-0532-6,"Unit commitment problem,Distributionally robust optimization,Mixture distribution,Sample average approximation,Convergence analysis"

0,Solving the chemical master equation for monomolecular reaction systems and beyond: a Doi-Peliti path integral view,"The chemical master equation (CME) is a fundamental description of interacting molecules commonly used to model chemical kinetics and noisy gene regulatory networks. Exact time-dependent solutions of the CME—which typically consists of infinitely many coupled differential equations—are rare, and are valuable for numerical benchmarking and getting intuition for the behavior of more complicated systems. Jahnke and Huisinga’s landmark calculation of the exact time-dependent solution of the CME for monomolecular reaction systems is one of the most general analytic results known; however, it is hard to generalize, because it relies crucially on special properties of monomolecular reactions. In this paper, we rederive Jahnke and Huisinga’s result on the time-dependent probability distribution and moments of monomolecular reaction systems using the Doi-Peliti path integral approach, which reduces solving the CME to evaluating many integrals. While the Doi-Peliti approach is less intuitive, it is also more mechanical, and hence easier to generalize. To illustrate how the Doi-Peliti approach can go beyond the method of Jahnke and Huisinga, we also find an explicit and exact time-dependent solution to a problem involving an autocatalytic reaction that Jahnke and Huisinga identified as not solvable using their method. Most interestingly, we are able to find a formal exact time-dependent solution for any CME whose list of reactions involves only zero and first order reactions, which may be the most general result currently known. This formal solution also yields a useful algorithm for efficiently computing numerical solutions to CMEs of this type.","John J. Vastola

0,Entropic repulsion for the Gaussian free field conditioned on disconnection by level-sets,"We investigate level-set percolation of the discrete Gaussian free field on \({\mathbb {Z}}^d\), \(d\ge 3\), in the strongly percolative regime. We consider the event that the level-set of the Gaussian free field below a level \(\alpha \) disconnects the discrete blow-up of a compact set \(A\subseteq {\mathbb {R}}^d\) from the boundary of an enclosing box. We derive asymptotic large deviation upper bounds on the probability that the local averages of the Gaussian free field deviate from a specific multiple of the harmonic potential of A, when disconnection occurs. These bounds, combined with the findings of the recent work by Duminil-Copin, Goswami, Rodriguez and Severo, show that conditionally on disconnection, the Gaussian free field experiences an entropic push-down proportional to the harmonic potential of A. In particular, due to the slow decay of correlations, the disconnection event affects the field on the whole lattice. Furthermore, we provide a certain ‘profile’ description for the field in the presence of disconnection. We show that while on a macroscopic scale the field is pinned around a level proportional to the harmonic potential of A, it locally retains the structure of a Gaussian free field shifted by a constant value. Our proofs rely crucially on the ‘solidification estimates’ developed in Nitzschner and Sznitman (to appear in J Eur Math Soc, arXiv:1706.07229).","Alberto Chiarini

We investigate the site version of this process on the triangular lattice where clusters freeze as soon as they reach \(L^{\infty }\) diameter at least \(N\) for some parameter \(N\). We show, informally speaking, that in the limit \(N\rightarrow \infty \), the clusters only freeze in the critical window of site percolation on the triangular lattice. Hence the fraction of vertices that eventually (i. e. at time \(1\)) are in a frozen cluster tends to \(0\) as \(N\) goes to infinity. We also show that the diameter of the open cluster at time \(1\) of a given vertex is, with high probability, smaller than \(N\) but of order \(N\). This shows that the process on the triangular lattice has a behaviour quite different from Aldous’ process. We also indicate which modifications have to be made to adapt the proofs to the case of the \(N\)-parameter frozen bond percolation process on the square lattice. This extends our results to the square lattice, and answers the questions posed by van den Berg et al.

0,Case study of Swiss mortality using Bayesian modeling,"Most mortality models to date in life insurance have inconsistent modeling assumptions between past and future survival probabilities. This paper aims at correcting this inconsistency by introducing a Bayesian framework for the joint modeling of past survival probabilities and the forecasting of future survival probabilities. To that end, the Bayesian modeling framework introduced considers both the uncertainty in the populations counts (random effects) as well as the uncertainty in the survival probability surface (systemic effects). In particular, the model uses an n-dimensional latent risk factor process to encode the survival probability surface, taking into account its intrinsic dependencies. We use the model for a case study of Swiss mortality. The case study shows that the model fits well to Swiss data and systemic events in the Swiss survival probability surface are captured by the model. The Swiss case study also exhibits the different rate of improvements in mortality for different age groups of the Swiss population.

Effecient methods for encoding, generating initial populations, selection, crossover and mutation are proposed, according to the problem characteristics. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed global search algorithm, four advanced local search algorithms based on the threshold accepting algorithm, the great deluge algorithm, and the tabu search algorithm, are also developed and are used for comparison purpose. To assist with the comparison of the proposed algorithms, a randomized network generator is designed to produce test problems. All the tests are performed on a personal computer.

0,Does Counting Different Life Stages Impact Estimates for Extinction Probabilities for Tsetse (Glossina spp)?,"As insect populations decline, due to climate change and other environmental disruptions, there has been an increased interest in understanding extinction probabilities. Generally, the life cycle of insects occurs in well-defined stages: when counting insects, questions naturally arise about which life stage to count. Using tsetse flies (vectors of trypanosomiasis) as a case study, we develop a model that works when different life stages are counted. Previous branching process models for tsetse populations only explicitly represent newly emerged adult female tsetse and use that subpopulation to keep track of population growth/decline. Here, we directly model other life stages. We analyse reproduction numbers and extinction probabilities and show that several previous models used for estimating extinction probabilities for tsetse populations are special cases of the current model. We confirm that the reproduction number is the same regardless of which life stage is counted, and show how the extinction probability depends on which life stage we start from. We demonstrate, and provide a biological explanation for, a simple relationship between extinction probabilities for the different life stages, based on the probability of recruitment between stages. These results offer insights into insect population dynamics and provide tools that will help with more detailed models of tsetse populations. Population dynamics studies of insects should be clear about life stages and counting points.","Elisha B. Are

0,Compressive Wave Computation,"This paper presents a method for computing the solution to the time-dependent wave equation from the knowledge of a largely incomplete set of eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz operator, chosen at random. While a linear superposition of eigenfunctions can fail to properly synthesize the solution if a single term is missing, it is shown that solving a sparsity-promoting ℓ
1 minimization problem can vastly enhance the quality of recovery. This phenomenon may be seen as “compressive sampling in the Helmholtz domain.”An error bound is formulated for the one-dimensional wave equation with coefficients of small bounded variation. Under suitable assumptions, it is shown that the number of eigenfunctions needed to evolve a sparse wavefield defined on N points, accurately with very high probability, is bounded by 
$$C(\eta) \cdot\log N \cdot\log\log N,$$ where C(η) is related to the desired accuracy η and can be made to grow at a much slower rate than N when the solution is sparse. To the authors’ knowledge, the partial differential equation estimates that underlie this result are new and may be of independent mathematical interest. They include an L
1 estimate for the wave equation, an L
∞−L

The non-linear nature of quantization makes the analysis of the corresponding approximation error challenging, often resulting in the use of a simplifying assumption, called the “white noise hypothesis” (WNH) that is useful, yet also known to be not rigorous and, at least in certain cases, not valid. We obtain rigorous reconstruction error estimates without relying on the WNH in the setting where generalized samples of a fixed deterministic signal are obtained using (the analysis matrix of) a random frame with independent isotropic sub-Gaussian rows; quantized using MSQ; and reconstructed linearly. We establish non-asymptotic error bounds that explain the observed error decay rate as the number of measurements grows, which in the special case of Gaussian random frames show that the error approaches a (small) non-zero constant lower bound. We also extend our methodology to dithered and noisy settings as well as the compressed sensing setting where we obtain rigorous error bounds that agree with empirical observations, again, without resorting to the WNH.","Kateryna Melnykova

0,Quantum state tomography with time-continuous measurements: reconstruction with resource limitations,"We propose and analyze quantum state estimation (tomography) using continuous quantum measurements with resource limitations, allowing the global state of many qubits to be constructed from only measuring a few. We give a proof-of-principle investigation demonstrating successful tomographic reconstruction of an arbitrary initial quantum state for three different situations: single qubit, remote qubit, and two interacting qubits. The tomographic reconstruction utilizes only a continuous weak probe of a single qubit observable, a fixed coupling Hamiltonian, together with single-qubit controls. In the single-qubit case, a combination of the continuous measurement of an observable and a Rabi oscillation is sufficient to find all three unknown qubit state components. For two interacting qubits, where only one observable of the first qubit is measured, the control Hamiltonian can be implemented to transfer all quantum information to the measured observable, via the qubit–qubit interaction and Rabi oscillation controls applied locally on each qubit.

We adopt a latent class joint model which considers a longitudinal biomarker process and an event process jointly, to address heterogeneity of patients and disease, to discover distinct biomarker trajectory patterns, to classify patients into different risk groups, and to predict the risk of disease recurrence. The model is used to develop a monitoring strategy that dynamically modifies the monitoring intervals according to patients’ current risk derived from periodically updated biomarker measurements and other indicators of disease spread. The optimal biomarker assessment time is derived using a utility function. We develop an algorithm to apply the proposed strategy to monitoring of new patients after initial treatment.

0,Structural Heterogeneity and Evolutionary Dynamics on Complex Networks,"The study of evolutionary games on networks has revealed the impact of population structure on evolutionary dynamics. Unlike the case in well-mixed population where defection is favored by natural selection, certain types of networks have shown to favor cooperation. However, most previous research work has been focusing on frequency-based analysis, and emphasized on the update strategy adopted by each player, and thus generally considered the group of players with the same strategy as a whole. While it is powerful in deriving analytic results using this approach, the heterogeneity of players within such groups is effectively overlooked. In this paper, we attempt to emphasize more on the heterogeneity of players that comes from the network structure in evolutionary dynamics. Particularly, the prestige of a player is represented by its centrality, and it is reflected in an adapted payoff function. We provide several viable centrality measures that can be calculated using the adjacency matrix of the network. The relation between different centrality measures of the invader and the fixation of cooperation is analyzed via computational simulations. Results show that in the proposed model, compared to other three centrality measures, invaders with maximum betweenness centrality have significant advantage in terms of the fixation probability of cooperation, in both scale-free and small-world networks.","Jinhua Zhao1, Xianjia Wang

We develop a stochastic ODE model of HIV–CTL interaction that extends current deterministic ODE models. Based on this stochastic model, we consider the effect of CTL attack on intrahost HIV lineages assuming that CTLs attack several epitopes with equal strength. In this setting, we introduce a limiting version of our stochastic ODE under which we show that the coalescence of HIV lineages can be described through Poisson–Dirichlet distributions. Through numerical experiments, we show that our results under the limiting stochastic ODE accurately reflect HIV lineages under CTL attack when the HIV population size is on the low end of its hypothesized range.

0,Generalizations of the ‘Linear Chain Trick’: incorporating more flexible dwell time distributions into mean field ODE models,"In this paper we generalize the Linear Chain Trick (LCT; aka the Gamma Chain Trick) to help provide modelers more flexibility to incorporate appropriate dwell time assumptions into mean field ODEs, and help clarify connections between individual-level stochastic model assumptions and the structure of corresponding mean field ODEs. The LCT is a technique used to construct mean field ODE models from continuous-time stochastic state transition models where the time an individual spends in a given state (i.e., the dwell time) is Erlang distributed (i.e., gamma distributed with integer shape parameter). Despite the LCT’s widespread use, we lack general theory to facilitate the easy application of this technique, especially for complex models. Modelers must therefore choose between constructing ODE models using heuristics with oversimplified dwell time assumptions, using time consuming derivations from first principles, or to instead use non-ODE models (like integro-differential or delay differential equations) which can be cumbersome to derive and analyze. Here, we provide analytical results that enable modelers to more efficiently construct ODE models using the LCT or related extensions. Specifically, we provide (1) novel LCT extensions for various scenarios found in applications, including conditional dwell time distributions; (2) formulations of these LCT extensions that bypass the need to derive ODEs from integral equations; and (3) a novel Generalized Linear Chain Trick (GLCT) framework that extends the LCT to a much broader set of possible dwell time distribution assumptions, including the flexible phase-type distributions which can approximate distributions on \({\mathbb {R}}^+\) and can be fit to data.","Paul J.

With these instances and with an appropriate choice of representation, stochastic and deterministic searches can—routinely and in a practical amount of time—find solutions several orders of magnitude better than those constructed by the best heuristic known (Ref. 2), which does not employ searching.","W.

We present two randomized algorithms that provide accurate relative-error approximations to the optimal value and the solution vector of a least squares approximation problem more rapidly than existing exact algorithms. Both of our algorithms preprocess the data with the Randomized Hadamard transform. One then uniformly randomly samples constraints and solves the smaller problem on those constraints, and the other performs a sparse random projection and solves the smaller problem on those projected coordinates. In both cases, solving the smaller problem provides relative-error approximations, and, if n is sufficiently larger than d, the approximate solution can be computed in O(nd ln d) time.","Petros Drineas1, Michael W.

These hypotheses also give precise asymptotics for the limiting behaviour of the probability of exiting a large ball, that is for the extrinsic one-arm probability. We show that these conditions are satisfied by the voter model in dimensions \(d\ge 2\), sufficiently spread out critical oriented percolation and critical contact processes in dimensions \(d>4\), and sufficiently spread out critical lattice trees in dimensions \(d>8\).

The features of the considered resolution heuristic are described. Some key issues raised by its complexity are discussed, as well as the major factors that constitute the sources of imprecision, inaccuracy, and uncertainty of the model and the way in which they are dealt with in the adopted resolution approach.

0,Harmonic analysis on the infinite symmetric group,"The infinite symmetric group S(∞), whose elements are finite permutations of {1,2,3,...}, is a model example of a “big” group. By virtue of an old result of Murray–von Neumann, the one–sided regular representation of S(∞) in the Hilbert space ℓ2(S(∞)) generates a type II1 von Neumann factor while the two–sided regular representation is irreducible. This shows that the conventional scheme of harmonic analysis is not applicable to S(∞): for the former representation, decomposition into irreducibles is highly non–unique, and for the latter representation, there is no need of any decomposition at all. We start with constructing a compactification \(\mathfrak{S}\supset{S(\infty)}\), which we call the space of virtual permutations. Although \(\mathfrak{S}\) is no longer a group, it still admits a natural two–sided action of S(∞). Thus, \(\mathfrak{S}\) is a G–space, where G stands for the product of two copies of S(∞). On \(\mathfrak{S}\), there exists a unique G-invariant probability measure μ1, which has to be viewed as a “true” Haar measure for S(∞). More generally, we include μ1 into a family {μ
t
: t>0} of distinguished G-quasiinvariant probability measures on virtual permutations. By making use of these measures, we construct a family {T
z
: z∈ℂ} of unitary representations of G,
called generalized regular representations (each representation T
z
 with z≠=0 can be realized in the Hilbert space \(L^2(\mathfrak{S}, \mu_t)\), where t=|z|2). As |z|→∞, the generalized regular representations T
z
 approach, in a suitable sense, the “naive” two–sided regular representation of the group G in the space ℓ2(S(∞)). In contrast with the latter representation, the generalized regular representations T
z
 are highly reducible and have a rich structure. We prove that any T
z
 admits a (unique) decomposition into a multiplicity free continuous integral of irreducible representations of G. For any two distinct (and not conjugate) complex numbers z1, z2, the spectral types of the representations \(T_{z_1}\) and \(T_{z_2}\) are shown to be disjoint. In the case z∈ℤ, a complete description of the spectral type is obtained. Further work on the case z∈ℂ∖ℤ reveals a remarkable link with stochastic point processes and random matrix theory.

One new algorithm creates a search structure for arrangements of hyperplanes by sampling the hyperplanes and using information from the resulting arrangement to divide and conquer. This algorithm requiresO(s

The expectation, as with all expected times reported here, is with respect to the random behavior of the algorithm, and holds for any input. Given the data structure, and a query pointp, the cell of the arrangement containingp can be found inO(logs) worst-case time. (The bound holds for any fixed ε>0, with the constant factors dependent ond and ε.) Using point-plane duality, the algorithm may be used for answering halfspace range queries. Another algorithm finds random samples of simplices to determine the separation distance of two polytopes. The algorithm uses expectedO(n
[d/2]) time, wheren is the total number of vertices of the two polytopes. This matches previous results [10] for the cased = 3 and extends them. Another algorithm samples points in the plane to determine their orderk Voronoi diagram, and requires expectedO(s

We assume that the security returns are triangular fuzzy random variables. To solve the proposed portfolio problems, this paper first presents the variance formulas for triangular fuzzy random variables. Then this paper applies the variance formulas to the proposed models so that the original portfolio problems can be reduced to nonlinear programming ones.

0,Global Optimization of Econometric Functions,"Estimating the values of the parameter estimates of econometric functions (maximum likelihood functions or nonlinear least squares functions) are often challenging global optimization problems. Determining the global optimum for these functions is necessary to understand economic behavior and to develop effective economic policies. These functions often have flat surfaces or surfaces characterized by many local optima. Classical deterministic optimization methods often do not yield successful results. For that reason, stochastic optimization methods are becoming widely used in econometrics. Selected stochastic methods are applied to two difficult econometric functions to determine if they might be useful in estimating the parameters of these functions.",Max E. Jerrell1 & Wendy A.

2(B,η) is equal to ∥λΓ(μ)∥, where πη is the unitary representation in L

We assume that \(s_{xy}\) vanishes if \(|x-y|\) exceeds the band width W, and we are interested in the mesoscopic scale with \(1\ll W\ll N\). Define the generalized resolvent of H as \(G(H,Z):=(H - Z)^{-1}\), where Z is a deterministic diagonal matrix with entries \(Z_{xx}\in \mathbb {C}_+\) for all x. Then we establish a precise high-probability bound on certain averages of polynomials of the resolvent entries. As an application of this fluctuation averaging result, we give a self-contained proof for the delocalization of random band matrices in dimensions \(d\ge 2\). More precisely, for any fixed \(d\ge 2\), we prove that the bulk eigenvectors of H are delocalized in certain averaged sense if \(N\le W^{1+\frac{d}{2}}\).

0,Constraint-guided evolutionary algorithm for solving the winner determination problem,"Combinatorial Auctions (CAs) allow the participants to bid on a bundle of items and can result in more cost-effective deals than traditional auctions if the goods are complementary. However, solving the Winner Determination Problem (WDP) in CAs is an NP-hard problem. Since Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) can find good solutions in polynomial time within a huge search space, the use of EAs has become quite suitable for solving this type of problem. In this paper, we introduce a new Constraint-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (CGEA) for the WDP. It employs a penalty component to represent each constraint in the fitness function and introduces new variation operators that consider each package value and each type of violated constraint to induce the generation of feasible solutions. CGEA also presents a survivor selection operator that maintains the exploration versus exploitation balance in the evolutionary process. The performance of CGEA is compared with that of three other evolutionary algorithms to solve a WDP in a Combinatorial Reverse Auction (CRA) of electricity generation and transmission line assets. Each of the algorithms compared employs different methods to deal with constraints. They are tested and compared on several problem instances. The results show that CGEA is competitive and results in better performance in most cases.

0,Studies in stochastic learning theory: II. Interpretation of response probabilities,"Response probabilities are interpreted from two points of view. One corresponds to fluctuations in physical parameters suggestive of a neurological basis, and the other corresponds to fluctuations in stimulus sample constitution. The two interpretations are shown to be equivalent under rather general conditions, giving the same type of relation between response and training states. This relation is different from that obtained via the response strength concept used in Part I. As a step toward evaluating the difference in predicted behavior for these different response-training relations, a general functional-difference equation is derived that describes the moments of the corresponding stochastic process in experimenter-subject controlled experiments. As an immediate application, it is used to obtain the continuity condition for the solution of the functional equation treated in Part I, and to justify the differentiability conditions assumed in establishing asymptotic properties of the solution as a function of the reinforcement parameter.",H.

0,Singular Value Perturbation and Deep Network Optimization,"We develop new theoretical results on matrix perturbation to shed light on the impact of architecture on the performance of a deep network. In particular, we explain analytically what deep learning practitioners have long observed empirically: the parameters of some deep architectures (e.g., residual networks, ResNets, and Dense networks, DenseNets) are easier to optimize than others (e.g., convolutional networks, ConvNets). Building on our earlier work connecting deep networks with continuous piecewise-affine splines, we develop an exact local linear representation of a deep network layer for a family of modern deep networks that includes ConvNets at one end of a spectrum and ResNets, DenseNets, and other networks with skip connections at the other. For regression and classification tasks that optimize the squared-error loss, we show that the optimization loss surface of a modern deep network is piecewise quadratic in the parameters, with local shape governed by the singular values of a matrix that is a function of the local linear representation. We develop new perturbation results for how the singular values of matrices of this sort behave as we add a fraction of the identity and multiply by certain diagonal matrices. A direct application of our perturbation results explains analytically why a network with skip connections (such as a ResNet or DenseNet) is easier to optimize than a ConvNet: thanks to its more stable singular values and smaller condition number, the local loss surface of such a network is less erratic, less eccentric, and features local minima that are more accommodating to gradient-based optimization. Our results also shed new light on the impact of different nonlinear activation functions on a deep network’s singular values, regardless of its architecture.

0,A mean field approach for optimization in discrete time,"This paper investigates the limit behavior of Markov decision processes made of independent objects evolving in a common environment, when the number of objects (N) goes to infinity. In the finite horizon case, we show that when the number of objects becomes large, the optimal cost of the system converges to the optimal cost of a discrete time system that is deterministic. Convergence also holds for optimal policies. We further provide bounds on the speed of convergence by proving second order results that resemble central limits theorems for the cost and the state of the Markov decision process, with explicit formulas for the limit. These bounds (of order \(1/\sqrt{N}\)) are proven to be tight in a numerical example. One can even go further and get convergence of order \(\sqrt{\log N}/N\) to a stochastic system made of the mean field limit and a Gaussian term. Our framework is applied to a brokering problem in grid computing. Several simulations with growing numbers of processors are reported. They compare the performance of the optimal policy of the limit system used in the finite case with classical policies by measuring its asymptotic gain. Several extensions are also discussed. In particular, for infinite horizon cases with discounted costs, we show that first order limits hold and that second order results also hold as long as the discount factor is small enough. As for infinite horizon cases with non-discounted costs, examples show that even the first order limits may not hold.","Nicolas Gast1,2 & Bruno Gaujal2,",Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10626-010-0094-3,"Mean field,Markov decision process,Brokering"

0,Two-level evolutionary approach to the survivable mesh-based transport network topological design,"The complete topology design problem of survivable mesh-based transport networks is to address simultaneously design of network topology, working path routing, and spare capacity allocation based on span-restoration. Each constituent problem in the complete design problem could be formulated as an Integer Programming (IP) and is proved to be 
\(\mathcal{NP}\)
-hard. Due to a large amount of decision variables and constraints involved in the IP formulation, to solve the problem directly by exact algorithms (e.g. branch-and-bound) would be impractical if not impossible. In this paper, we present a two-level evolutionary approach to address the complete topology design problem. In the low-level, two parameterized greedy heuristics are developed to jointly construct feasible solutions (i.e., closed graph topologies satisfying all the mesh-based network survivable constraints) of the complete problem. Unlike existing “zoom-in”-based heuristics in which subsets of the constraints are considered, the proposed heuristics take all constraints into account. An estimation of distribution algorithm works on the top of the heuristics to tune the control parameters. As a result, optimal solution to the considered problem is more likely to be constructed from the heuristics with the optimal control parameters. The proposed algorithm is evaluated experimentally in comparison with the latest heuristics based on the IP software CPLEX, and the “zoom-in”-based approach on 28 test networks problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more effective in finding high-quality topologies than the IP-based heuristic algorithm in 21 out of 28 test instances with much less computational costs, and performs significantly better than the “zoom-in”-based approach in 19 instances with the same computational costs.","J.

0,A Trigonometric Mutation Operation to Differential Evolution,"Previous studies have shown that differential evolution is an efficient, effective and robust evolutionary optimization method. However, the convergence rate of differential evolution in optimizing a computationally expensive objective function still does not meet all our requirements, and attempting to speed up DE is considered necessary. In this paper, a new local search operation, trigonometric mutation, is proposed and embedded into the differential evolution algorithm. This modification enables the algorithm to get a better trade-off between the convergence rate and the robustness. Thus it can be possible to increase the convergence velocity of the differential evolution algorithm and thereby obtain an acceptable solution with a lower number of objective function evaluations. Such an improvement can be advantageous in many real-world problems where the evaluation of a candidate solution is a computationally expensive operation and consequently finding the global optimum or a good sub-optimal solution with the original differential evolution algorithm is too time-consuming, or even impossible within the time available. In this article, the mechanism of the trigonometric mutation operation is presented and analyzed. The modified differential evolution algorithm is demonstrated in cases of two well-known test functions, and is further examined with two practical training problems of neural networks. The obtained numerical simulation results are providing empirical evidences on the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed modified differential evolution algorithm.","Hui-Yuan Fan1,2 & Jouni Lampinen",Journal of Global Optimization,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1024653025686,"differential evolution,evolutionary algorithm,mutation operation,nonlinear optimization"
0,Jackknife multiplier bootstrap: finite sample approximations to the U-process supremum with applications,"This paper is concerned with finite sample approximations to the supremum of a non-degenerate U-process of a general order indexed by a function class. We are primarily interested in situations where the function class as well as the underlying distribution change with the sample size, and the U-process itself is not weakly convergent as a process. Such situations arise in a variety of modern statistical problems. We first consider Gaussian approximations, namely, approximate the U-process supremum by the supremum of a Gaussian process, and derive coupling and Kolmogorov distance bounds. Such Gaussian approximations are, however, not often directly applicable in statistical problems since the covariance function of the approximating Gaussian process is unknown. This motivates us to study bootstrap-type approximations to the U-process supremum. We propose a novel jackknife multiplier bootstrap (JMB) tailored to the U-process, and derive coupling and Kolmogorov distance bounds for the proposed JMB method. All these results are non-asymptotic, and established under fairly general conditions on function classes and underlying distributions. Key technical tools in the proofs are new local maximal inequalities for U-processes, which may be useful in other problems. We also discuss applications of the general approximation results to testing for qualitative features of nonparametric functions based on generalized local U-processes.",Xiaohui Chen1 & Kengo Kato,Probability Theory and Related Fields,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-019-00936-y,"Gaussian approximation,Jackknife multiplier bootstrap,Coupling,U-process,Local maximal inequality"

0,Most stringent and maximin tests as solutions of linear programming problems,"The problem to obtain the most stringent size-α test ϕ
* is formulated as a linear programming problem of type II (Section 2). If sample space and parameter space are finite, then we obtain a discrete linear programming problem (Section 4). The well-known results for this special case, and the results of Krafft and Witting for the maximin size-α test, point out how to formulate the dual problem of type I in the general case and how to develop the corresponding duality theory (Sections 5 and 6). It turns out that ϕ
* can be determined completely by the solution of the dual type I problem, which solution may be characterized by means of a least favorable pair \((\tilde \lambda ,\tilde v)\) of probability measures over Ω

0,"KPZ equation, its renormalization and invariant measures","The Kardar–Parisi–Zhang (KPZ) equation is a stochastic partial differential equation which is ill-posed because of the inconsistency between the nonlinearity and the roughness of the forcing noise. However, its Cole–Hopf solution, defined as the logarithm of the solution of the linear stochastic heat equation (SHE) with a multiplicative noise, is a mathematically well-defined object. In fact, Hairer (Ann Math 178:559–694, 2013) has recently proved that the solution of SHE can actually be derived through the Cole–Hopf transform of the solution of the KPZ equation with a suitable renormalization under periodic boundary conditions. This transformation is unfortunately not well adapted to studying the invariant measures of these Markov processes. The present paper introduces a different type of regularization for the KPZ equation on the whole line \({\mathbb {R}}\) or under periodic boundary conditions, which is appropriate from the viewpoint of studying the invariant measures. The Cole–Hopf transform applied to this equation leads to an SHE with a smeared noise having an extra complicated nonlinear term. Under time average and in the stationary regime, it is shown that this term can be replaced by a simple linear term, so that the limit equation is the linear SHE with an extra linear term with coefficient \(\tfrac{1}{24}\). The methods are essentially stochastic analytic: The Wiener–Itô expansion and a similar method for establishing the Boltzmann–Gibbs principle are used. As a result, it is shown that the distribution of a two-sided geometric Brownian motion with a height shift given by Lebesgue measure is invariant under the evolution determined by the SHE on \({\mathbb {R}}\).",Tadahisa Funaki1 & Jeremy Quastel,Stochastic Partial Differential Equations: Analysis and Computations,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40072-015-0046-x,"Invariant measure,Stochastic partial differential equation,KPZ equation,Cole–Hopf transform"
0,Metastability in a condensing zero-range process in the thermodynamic limit,"Zero-range processes with decreasing jump rates are known to exhibit condensation, where a finite fraction of all particles concentrates on a single lattice site when the total density exceeds a critical value. We study such a process on a one-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions in the thermodynamic limit with fixed, super-critical particle density. We show that the process exhibits metastability with respect to the condensate location, i.e. the suitably accelerated process of the rescaled location converges to a limiting Markov process on the unit torus. This process has stationary, independent increments and the rates are characterized by the scaling limit of capacities of a single random walker on the lattice. Our result extends previous work for fixed lattices and diverging density [In: Beltran and Landim, Probab Theory Relat Fields 152(3–4):781–807, 2012], and we follow the martingale approach developed there and in subsequent publications. Besides additional technical difficulties in estimating error bounds for transition rates, the thermodynamic limit requires new estimates for equilibration towards a suitably defined distribution in metastable wells, corresponding to a typical set of configurations with a particular condensate location. The total exit rates from individual wells turn out to diverge in the limit, which requires an intermediate regularization step using the symmetries of the process and the regularity of the limit generator. Another important novel contribution is a coupling construction to provide a uniform bound on the exit rates from metastable wells, which is of a general nature and can be adapted to other models.","Inés Armendáriz1, Stefan Grosskinsky2 & Michail Loulakis

0,Matrix method to study IEEE 802.11 network,"In this paper, we estimate characteristics of the IEEE 802.11 DCF (Distributed Coordination Function) in non-saturation mode. We take into account two significant features inherent to the non-saturated 802.11 DCF: (i) the possibility of asynchronous transmission performed without preceding backoff for the first packet arriving at the idle staion; and (ii) so-called post backoff meaning that a station must perform a backoff once after any of its transmissions even if its queue becomes empty. We derive the probability generating function (PGF) of Head-of-Line delay (HoL-delay). Our method to find PGF of HoL-delay is quite intuitive and straightforward. Also, we obtain the packet loss probability and non-saturation throughput. Numerical results show that these two features inherent to the non-saturated 802.11 DCF influence on the performance measures of DCF such as delay considerably and it should be taken into account for accurate modeling of DCF.","Y.

0,Method of conditional moments (MCM) for the Chemical Master Equation,"The time-evolution of continuous-time discrete-state biochemical processes is governed by the Chemical Master Equation (CME), which describes the probability of the molecular counts of each chemical species. As the corresponding number of discrete states is, for most processes, large, a direct numerical simulation of the CME is in general infeasible. In this paper we introduce the method of conditional moments (MCM), a novel approximation method for the solution of the CME. The MCM employs a discrete stochastic description for low-copy number species and a moment-based description for medium/high-copy number species. The moments of the medium/high-copy number species are conditioned on the state of the low abundance species, which allows us to capture complex correlation structures arising, e.g., for multi-attractor and oscillatory systems. We prove that the MCM provides a generalization of previous approximations of the CME based on hybrid modeling and moment-based methods. Furthermore, it improves upon these existing methods, as we illustrate using a model for the dynamics of stochastic single-gene expression. This application example shows that due to the more general structure, the MCM allows for the approximation of multi-modal distributions.","J. Hasenauer1,2, V. Wolf3, A. Kazeroonian1 & …F. J.

0,Tensor-Free Proximal Methods for Lifted Bilinear/Quadratic Inverse Problems with Applications to Phase Retrieval,"We propose and study a class of novel algorithms that aim at solving bilinear and quadratic inverse problems. Using a convex relaxation based on tensorial lifting, and applying first-order proximal algorithms, these problems could be solved numerically by singular value thresholding methods. However, a direct realization of these algorithms for, e.g., image recovery problems is often impracticable, since computations have to be performed on the tensor-product space, whose dimension is usually tremendous. To overcome this limitation, we derive tensor-free versions of common singular value thresholding methods by exploiting low-rank representations and incorporating an augmented Lanczos process. Using a novel reweighting technique, we further improve the convergence behavior and rank evolution of the iterative algorithms. Applying the method to the two-dimensional masked Fourier phase retrieval problem, we obtain an efficient recovery method. Moreover, the tensor-free algorithms are flexible enough to incorporate a priori smoothness constraints that greatly improve the recovery results.","Robert Beinert1,2 & Kristian Bredies",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-020-09479-4,"Tensor-free proximal methods,Tensorial lifting,Nuclear norm relaxation,Reweighting techniques,Bilinear inverse problem,Quadratic inverse problem,Masked Fourier phase retrieval"

0,Bootstrap confidence sets for spectral projectors of sample covariance,"Let \( X_{1},\ldots ,X_{n} \) be i.i.d. sample in \( \mathbb {R}^{p} \) with zero mean and the covariance matrix \( \varvec{\Sigma }\). The problem of recovering the projector onto an eigenspace of \( \varvec{\Sigma }\) from these observations naturally arises in many applications. Recent technique from Koltchinskii and Lounici (Ann Stat 45(1):121–157, 2017) helps to study the asymptotic distribution of the distance in the Frobenius norm \( \left\| \mathbf {P}_{r} - \widehat{\mathbf {P}}_{r} \right\| _{2} \) between the true projector \( \mathbf {P}_{r} \) on the subspace of the rth eigenvalue and its empirical counterpart \( \widehat{\mathbf {P}}_{r} \) in terms of the effective rank of \( \varvec{\Sigma }\). This paper offers a bootstrap procedure for building sharp confidence sets for the true projector \( \mathbf {P}_{r} \) from the given data. This procedure does not rely on the asymptotic distribution of \( \left\| \mathbf {P}_{r} - \widehat{\mathbf {P}}_{r} \right\| _{2} \) and its moments. It could be applied for small or moderate sample size n and large dimension p. The main result states the validity of the proposed procedure for Gaussian samples with an explicit error bound for the error of bootstrap approximation.

The unit cell models were used to calculate the macroscopic creep behavior with different micro geometric parameters of fibers on different loading directions. The influence of the geometric parameters of the fibers and loading directions on the macroscopic creep behavior had been obtained, and described quantitatively. The matrix/fiber interface had been considered by a third layer, matrix/fiber interlayer, in the unit cells with different creep properties and thickness. Based on the numerical results of the unit cell models, a statistic model had been presented for the plane randomly-distributed-fiber MMCs. The fiber breakage had been taken into account in the statistic model for it starts experimentally early in the creep life. With the distribution of the geometric parameters of the fibers, the results of the statistic model agree well with the experiments.

The main contribution is a general procedure to design an observer for computing the probabilities of the states for labeled continuous time Markov models as functions of time, based on a sequence of observations and their associated time stamps that have been collected thus far. Two notions of state consistency with respect to such a timed observation sequence are introduced and related necessary and sufficient conditions are derived. The method is then applied to the detection of cyber-attacks. The plant and the possible attacks are described in terms of a labeled continuous time Markov model that includes both observable and unobservable events, and where each attack corresponds to a particular subset of states.

In this phase, particle trails must converge to the geometric boundaryΩ of the tree. The random subset Λ of the boundary consisting of all ends of the tree in which the population survives, called the limit set of the process, is shown to have Hausdorff dimension no larger than one half the Hausdorff dimension of the entire geometric boundary. Moreover, there is strict inequality at the phase separation point between weak and strong survival except when the branching random walk is isotropic. It is further shown that in all cases there is a distinguished probability measure μ supported by Ω such that the Hausdorff dimension of Λ∩Ωμ, where Ωμ is the set of μ-generic points of Ω, converges to one half the Hausdorff dimension of Ωμ at the phase separation point.

0,"The multiplicative coalescent, inhomogeneous continuum random trees, and new universality classes for critical random graphs","One major open conjecture in the area of critical random graphs, formulated by statistical physicists, and supported by a large amount of numerical evidence over the last decade (Braunstein et al. in Phys Rev Lett 91(16):168701, 2003; Wu et al. in Phys Rev Lett 96(14):148702, 2006; Braunstein et al. Int J Bifurc Chaos 17(07):2215–2255, 2007; Chen et al. in Phys Rev Lett 96(6):068702, 2006) is as follows: for a wide array of random graph models with degree exponent \(\tau \in (3,4)\), distances between typical points both within maximal components in the critical regime as well as on the minimal spanning tree on the giant component in the supercritical regime scale like \(n^{(\tau -3)/(\tau -1)}\). In this paper we study the metric space structure of maximal components of the multiplicative coalescent, in the regime where the sizes converge to excursions of Lévy processes “without replacement” (Aldous and Limic Electron in J Probab 3(3):59, 1998), yielding a completely new class of limiting random metric spaces. A by-product of the analysis yields the continuum scaling limit of one fundamental class of random graph models with degree exponent \(\tau \in (3,4)\) where edges are rescaled by \(n^{-(\tau -3)/(\tau -1)}\) yielding the first rigorous proof of the above conjecture. The limits in this case are compact “tree-like” random fractals with a dense collection of hubs (infinite degree vertices), a finite number of which are identified with leaves to form shortcuts. In a special case, we show that the Minkowski dimension of the limiting spaces equal \((\tau -2)/(\tau -3)\) a.s., in stark contrast to the Erdős-Rényi scaling limit whose Minkowski dimension is 2 a.s. It is generally believed that dynamic versions of a number of fundamental random graph models, as one moves from the barely subcritical to the critical regime can be approximated by the multiplicative coalescent. In work in progress, the general theory developed in this paper is used to prove analogous limit results for other random graph models with degree exponent \(\tau \in (3,4)\). Our proof makes crucial use of inhomogeneous continuum random trees (ICRT), which have previously arisen in the study of the entrance boundary of the additive coalescent. We show that tilted versions of the same objects using the associated mass measure, describe connectivity properties of the multiplicative coalescent. Since convergence of height processes of corresponding approximating \(\mathbf {p}\)-trees is not known, we use general methodology in Athreya et al.

Our singular perturbation methodology, which is based on the assumption that the ratio \(\varepsilon \) of the radius of a typical prey patch to that of the overall landscape is asymptotically small, leads to the derivation of an algebraic system that determines the MFPT in terms of parameters characterizing the shapes of the small prey patches together with a certain Green’s function, which in general must be computed numerically. The expected error in approximating the MFPT by our semi-analytical procedure is smaller than any power of \({-1/\log \varepsilon }\), so that our approximation of the MFPT is still rather accurate at only moderately small prey patch radii. Overall, our hybrid approach has the advantage of eliminating the difficulty with resolving small spatial scales in a full numerical treatment of the partial differential equation (PDE). Similar semi-analytical methods are also developed and implemented to accurately calculate related quantities such as the variance of the mean first passage time (VMFPT) and the splitting probability. Results for the MFPT, the VMFPT, and splitting probability obtained from our hybrid methodology are validated with corresponding results computed from full numerical simulations of the underlying PDEs.","Venu Kurella1, Justin C.

These equations can be further used to construct fractional integro-differential equations for the ruin probabilities in collective renewal risk models, with inter-arrival time distributions from the aforementioned family.

A simple sufficient condition for close approximation is derived, which indicates the existence of three distinct approximation regimes.

0,From Proximity to Utility: A Voronoi Partition of Pareto Optima,"We present an extension of Voronoi diagrams where when considering which site a client is going to use, in addition to the site distances, other site attributes are also considered (for example, prices or weights). A cell in this diagram is then the locus of all clients that consider the same set of sites to be relevant. In particular, the precise site a client might use from this candidate set depends on parameters that might change between usages, and the candidate set lists all of the relevant sites. The resulting diagram is significantly more expressive than Voronoi diagrams, but naturally has the drawback that its complexity, even in the plane, might be quite high. Nevertheless, we show that if the attributes of the sites are drawn from the same distribution (note that the locations are fixed), then the expected complexity of the candidate diagram is near linear. To this end, we derive several new technical results, which are of independent interest. In particular, we provide a high-probability, asymptotically optimal bound on the number of Pareto optima points in a point set uniformly sampled from the d-dimensional hypercube. To do so we revisit the classical backward analysis technique, both simplifying and improving relevant results in order to achieve the high-probability bounds.","Hsien-Chih Chang1, Sariel Har-Peled1 & Benjamin Raichel",Discrete & Computational Geometry,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-016-9808-0,"Voronoi diagrams,Expected complexity,Backward analysis,Pareto optima,Candidate diagram,Clarkson-Shor technique"

The domination number of G, denoted by \(\gamma (G)\), is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set in G. Assuming that the graph \(G=(V,E)\) is connected, a subset \(D\subseteq V\) is said to be a connected dominating set if it is a dominating set and the subgraph G[D] induced by D is connected. The minimum cardinality of a connected dominating set is termed the connected domination number, denoted by \(\gamma _c(G)\). Comparing \(\gamma (G)\) and \(\gamma _c(G)\) for a random graph with constant edge probability p, we obtain that the two parameters are asymptotically equal with probability tending to 1 as the number of vertices gets large. We also consider nonconstant edge probability \(p_n\) tending to zero (where n is the number of vertices).

0,Market inconsistencies of market-consistent European life insurance economic valuations: pitfalls and practical solutions,"The Solvency II directive has introduced a specific so-called risk-neutral framework to valuate economic accounting quantities throughout European life insurance companies. The adaptation of this theoretical notion for regulatory purposes requires the addition of a specific criterion, namely market-consistency, in order to objectify the choice of the valuation probability measure. This paper points out and fixes some of the major risk sources embedded in the current regulatory life insurance valuation scheme. We compare actuarial and financial valuation schemes. We then first address operational issues and potential market manipulation sources in life insurance, induced by both theoretical and regulatory pitfalls. For example, we show that the economic own funds of a representative French life insurance company can vary by almost 140%, as already observed by market practitioners, when the interest rate model is calibrated in October or on the 31st of December. We then propose various modifications of the current implementation, including a first product-specific valuation scheme, to limit the impact of these market-inconsistencies.","Julien Vedani1, Nicole El Karoui2, Stéphane Loisel1 & …Jean-Luc Prigent",European Actuarial Journal,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13385-016-0141-z,"Risk-neutral valuation,Economic valuation,Market-consistency,European regulation,Life insurance"

This paper studies two extensions of the SSAP. The first one assumes that the values of any two consecutive tasks are dependent on each other while the exact number of tasks to arrive is unknown until after the final arrival. The second extension generalizes the first one by assuming that the number of workers is also random.

Traditionally, the main focus in stochastic optimization has been various stochastic mathematical programming (such as linear programming, convex programming). In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in stochastic combinatorial optimization problems from the theoretical computer science community. In this article, we survey some of the recent results on various stochastic versions of classical combinatorial optimization problems. Since most problems in this domain are NP-hard (or #P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard), we focus on the results which provide polynomial time approximation algorithms with provable approximation guarantees. Our discussions are centered around a few representative problems, such as stochastic knapsack, stochastic matching, multi-armed bandit etc. We use these examples to introduce several popular stochastic models, such as the fixed-set model, 2-stage stochastic optimization model, stochastic adaptive probing model etc, as well as some useful techniques for designing approximation algorithms for stochastic combinatorial optimization problems, including the linear programming relaxation approach, boosted sampling, content resolution schemes, Poisson approximation etc. We also provide some open research questions along the way.

0,Phase Transitions in Rate Distortion Theory and Deep Learning,"Rate distortion theory is concerned with optimally encoding signals from a given signal class \(\mathcal {S}\) using a budget of R bits, as \(R \rightarrow \infty \). We say that \(\mathcal {S}\) can be compressed at rate s if we can achieve an error of at most \(\mathcal {O}(R^{-s})\) for encoding the given signal class; the supremal compression rate is denoted by \(s^*(\mathcal {S})\). Given a fixed coding scheme, there usually are some elements of \(\mathcal {S}\) that are compressed at a higher rate than \(s^*(\mathcal {S})\) by the given coding scheme; in this paper, we study the size of this set of signals. We show that for certain “nice” signal classes \(\mathcal {S}\), a phase transition occurs: We construct a probability measure \(\mathbb {P}\) on \(\mathcal {S}\) such that for every coding scheme \(\mathcal {C}\) and any \(s > s^*(\mathcal {S})\), the set of signals encoded with error \(\mathcal {O}(R^{-s})\) by \(\mathcal {C}\) forms a \(\mathbb {P}\)-null-set. In particular, our results apply to all unit balls in Besov and Sobolev spaces that embed compactly into \(L^2 (\varOmega )\) for a bounded Lipschitz domain \(\varOmega \). As an application, we show that several existing sharpness results concerning function approximation using deep neural networks are in fact generically sharp. In addition, we provide quantitative and non-asymptotic bounds on the probability that a random \(f\in \mathcal {S}\) can be encoded to within accuracy \(\varepsilon \) using R bits. This result is subsequently applied to the problem of approximately representing \(f\in \mathcal {S}\) to within accuracy \(\varepsilon \) by a (quantized) neural network with at most W nonzero weights. We show that for any \(s > s^*(\mathcal {S})\) there are constants c, C such that, no matter what kind of “learning” procedure is used to produce such a network, the probability of success is bounded from above by \(\min \big \{1, 2^{C\cdot W \lceil \log _2 (1+W) \rceil ^2 - c\cdot \varepsilon ^{-1/s}} \big \}\).","Philipp Grohs1,2, Andreas Klotz1 & Felix Voigtlaender3 nAff",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-021-09546-4,"Rate distortion theory,Phase transition,Approximation rates,Sobolev spaces,Besov spaces,Neural network approximation"

0,Approximation of sojourn-times via maximal couplings: motif frequency distributions,"Sojourn-times provide a versatile framework to assess the statistical significance of motifs in genome-wide searches even under non-Markovian background models. However, the large state spaces encountered in genomic sequence analyses make the exact calculation of sojourn-time distributions computationally intractable in long sequences. Here, we use coupling and analytic combinatoric techniques to approximate these distributions in the general setting of Polish state spaces, which encompass discrete state spaces. Our approximations are accompanied with explicit, easy to compute, error bounds for total variation distance. Broadly speaking, if \({\mathsf{T}}_n\) is the random number of times a Markov chain visits a certain subset \({\mathsf{T}}\) of states in its first \(n\) transitions, then we can usually approximate the distribution of \({\mathsf{T}}_n\) for \(n\) of order \((1-\alpha )^{-m}\), where \(m\) is the largest integer for which the exact distribution of \({\mathsf{T}}_m\) is accessible and \(0\le \alpha \le 1\) is an ergodicity coefficient associated with the probability transition kernel of the chain. This gives access to approximations of sojourn-times in the intermediate regime where \(n\) is perhaps too large for exact calculations, but too small to rely on Normal approximations or stationarity assumptions underlying Poisson and compound Poisson approximations. As proof of concept, we approximate the distribution of the number of matches with a motif in promoter regions of C. elegans. Mathematical properties of the proposed ergodicity coefficients and connections with additive functionals of homogeneous Markov chains as well as ergodicity of non-homogeneous Markov chains are also explored.",Manuel E.

As partial sums of weakly dependent random variables can often be well approximated by martingales, this result also leads to almost sure invariance principles for a wide class of stationary ergodic sequences such as ø-mixing and α-mixing sequences and functionals of such sequences. Compared with previous related work for vector valued random variables (starting with an article by Kuelbs and Philipp [27]), the present approach leads to a unification of the theory (at least for stationary sequences), moment conditions required by earlier authors are relaxed (only second order weak moments are needed), and our proofs are easier in that we do not employ estimates of the rate of convergence in the central limit theorem but merely the central limit theorem itself.",Erich Berger1 nAff,Probability Theory and Related Fields,1990,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01197844,"Banach Space,Central Limit Theorem,Moment Condition,Stationary Sequence,Invariance Principle"

New criteria depending on these factors are established to confirm that the disease-free equilibrium of the model is stochastically asymptotically stable as the threshold parameter is less than unity, which implies that the disease eventually disappears theoretically. Otherwise, the disease persists weakly. Further, the main results show that the threshold values are related to two types of noise and time delay. Pulse control strategies are then applied to two types of the infected population, the susceptible population, and the infected population, respectively. More precisely, the effects of each control strategy on the stochastic solution of the model are evaluated to justify the relation between control parameters and threshold parameters of the model. In comparison with the basic reproduction number of the model with pulse control, it is easily found that the main results in these references are improved and extended. Finally, four examples are presented to support the main results, and one future research direction is suggested.","X. Y. Wang

That is, we aim to estimate the probability that a control system with uncertain parametersq restricted to a boxQ attains a given level of performance γ. Since this probability depends on the underlying distribution, we address the following question: What is a “reasonable” distribution so that the estimated probability makes sense? To answer this question, we define two worstcase criteria and prove that the uniform distribution is optimal in both cases. In the second part of the paper we turn our attention to a subsequent problem. That is, we estimate the sizes of both the so-called “good” and “bad” sets via sampling. Roughly speaking, the good set contains the parametersq∈Q with a performance level better than or equal to γ while the bad set is the set of parametersq∈Q with a performance level worse than γ.

0,Distributionally robust shortfall risk optimization model and its approximation,"Utility-based shortfall risk measures (SR) have received increasing attention over the past few years for their potential to quantify the risk of large tail losses more effectively than conditional value at risk. In this paper, we consider a distributionally robust version of the shortfall risk measure (DRSR) where the true probability distribution is unknown and the worst distribution from an ambiguity set of distributions is used to calculate the SR. We start by showing that the DRSR is a convex risk measure and under some special circumstance a coherent risk measure. We then move on to study an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the DRSR of a random function and investigate numerical tractability of the optimization problem with the ambiguity set being constructed through \(\phi \)-divergence ball and Kantorovich ball. In the case when the nominal distribution in the balls is an empirical distribution constructed through iid samples, we quantify convergence of the ambiguity sets to the true probability distribution as the sample size increases under the Kantorovich metric and consequently the optimal values of the corresponding DRSR problems. Specifically, we show that the error of the optimal value is linearly bounded by the error of each of the approximate ambiguity sets and subsequently derive a confidence interval of the optimal value under each of the approximation schemes.

0,Inadequacy of Linear Methods for Minimal Sensor Placement and Feature Selection in Nonlinear Systems: A New Approach Using Secants,"Sensor placement and feature selection are critical steps in engineering, modeling, and data science that share a common mathematical theme: the selected measurements should enable solution of an inverse problem. Most real-world systems of interest are nonlinear, yet the majority of available techniques for feature selection and sensor placement rely on assumptions of linearity or simple statistical models. We show that when these assumptions are violated, standard techniques can lead to costly over-sensing without guaranteeing that the desired information can be recovered from the measurements. In order to remedy these problems, we introduce a novel data-driven approach for sensor placement and feature selection for a general type of nonlinear inverse problem based on the information contained in secant vectors between data points. Using the secant-based approach, we develop three efficient greedy algorithms that each provide different types of robust, near-minimal reconstruction guarantees. We demonstrate them on two problems where linear techniques consistently fail: sensor placement to reconstruct a fluid flow formed by a complicated shock–mixing layer interaction and selecting fundamental manifold learning coordinates on a torus.

0,Dating and localizing an invasion from post-introduction data and a coupled reaction–diffusion–absorption model,"Invasion of new territories by alien organisms is of primary concern for environmental and health agencies and has been a core topic in mathematical modeling, in particular in the intents of reconstructing the past dynamics of the alien organisms and predicting their future spatial extents. Partial differential equations offer a rich and flexible modeling framework that has been applied to a large number of invasions. In this article, we are specifically interested in dating and localizing the introduction that led to an invasion using mathematical modeling, post-introduction data and an adequate statistical inference procedure. We adopt a mechanistic-statistical approach grounded on a coupled reaction–diffusion–absorption model representing the dynamics of an organism in an heterogeneous domain with respect to growth. Initial conditions (including the date and site of the introduction) and model parameters related to diffusion, reproduction and mortality are jointly estimated in the Bayesian framework by using an adaptive importance sampling algorithm. This framework is applied to the invasion of Xylella fastidiosa, a phytopathogenic bacterium detected in South Corsica in 2015, France.","Candy Abboud

multifractal wavelet series \(F_{\mu}=\sum_{j\ge0,k\in Z}d_{j,k}\psi_{j,k}(x)\) is to set \(\mid d_{j,k}\mid = 2^{-j(s_0-1/p_0)}\mu([k2^{-j},(k+1)2^{-j}))^{1/p_0}\), where \(s_0,p_0\ge 0, s_0-1/p_0 >0\). Indeed, under suitable conditions,
it is shown that the function Fµ inherits the multifractal properties of µ.

multifractal measures, enlarging the class of processes which have self-similarity properties

In this paper, we study the constrained k-means problem, where the clusters do not satisfy locality property and can be an arbitrary partition of the set of points.

Then, the collection is enumerated to get the one that can induce a \((1+\epsilon )\)-approximation solution for the constrained k-means problem.

In this paper, we study the identification problem for such systems, considering two different approaches. One approach is based on exact computation of the expected values and consists in recasting the identification problem as an optimization problem that can be solved using gradient-based algorithms. However, due to the structure of stochastic max-plus linear systems, this method results in a complex optimization problem. The alternative approach discussed in this paper, is an approximation method based on the higher-order moments of a random variable. This approach decreases the required computation time significantly while still guaranteeing a performance that is comparable to the one of the exact solution.","Samira S.

0,A procedure for finding Nash equilibria in bi-matrix games,"In this paper we consider the computation of Nash equilibria for noncooperative bi-matrix games. The standard method for finding a Nash equilibrium in such a game is the Lemke-Howson method. That method operates by solving a related linear complementarity problem (LCP). However, the method may fail to reach certain equilibria because it can only start from a limited number of strategy vectors. The method we propose here finds an equilibrium by solving a related stationary point problem (SPP). Contrary to the Lemke-Howson method it can start from almost any strategy vector. Besides, the path of vectors along which the equilibrium is reached has an appealing game-theoretic interpretation. An important feature of the algorithm is that it finds a perfect equilibrium when at the start all actions are played with positive probability. Furthermore, we can in principle find all Nash equilibria by repeated application of the algorithm starting from different strategy vectors.",A. H. van den Elzen1 & A. J. J.

In this case it is important to verify that such a Markov Chain indeed has a stationary distribution. In this paper we discuss a diffusion approximation to a discrete time AMCMC. This diffusion approximation is different when compared to the diffusion approximation as in Gelman et al. [5] where the state space increases in dimension to ∞. In our approach the time parameter is sped up in such a way that the limiting process (as the mesh size goes to 0) approaches to a non-trivial diffusion process.,G. K.

We have two results about this approximate ML decoding.

In particular, the order of the first nonlinearity is given by the minimum distance of its dual code.

0,Interval-based ranking in noisy evolutionary multi-objective optimization,"As one of the most competitive approaches to multi-objective optimization, evolutionary algorithms have been shown to obtain very good results for many real-world multi-objective problems. One of the issues that can affect the performance of these algorithms is the uncertainty in the quality of the solutions which is usually represented with the noise in the objective values. Therefore, handling noisy objectives in evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms becomes very important and is gaining more attention in recent years. In this paper we present \(\alpha \)-degree Pareto dominance relation for ordering the solutions in multi-objective optimization when the values of the objective functions are given as intervals. Based on this dominance relation, we propose an adaptation of the non-dominated sorting algorithm for ranking the solutions. This ranking method is then used in a standard multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and a recently proposed novel multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm based on joint variable-objective probabilistic modeling, and applied to a set of multi-objective problems with different levels of independent noise. The experimental results show that the use of the proposed method for solution ranking allows to approximate Pareto sets which are considerably better than those obtained when using the dominance probability-based ranking method, which is one of the main methods for noise handling in multi-objective optimization.","Hossein Karshenas1, Concha Bielza1 & Pedro Larrañaga",Computational Optimization and Applications,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10589-014-9717-1,"Noisy optimization,Interval analysis,Evolutionary algorithms,Multi-objective optimization,Joint probabilistic modeling,Estimation of distribution algorithm"

A precise definition of case fatality proportion for compartmental disease transmission models with disease induced mortality rate is given.

0,Fluctuations of shapes of large areas under paths of random walks,We discuss statistical properties of random walks conditioned by fixing a large area under their paths. We prove the functional central limit theorem (invariance principle) for these conditional distributions. The limiting Gaussian measure coincides with the conditional probability distribution of certain timenonhomogeneous Gaussian random process obtained by an integral transformation of the white noise. From the point of view of statistical mechanics the studied problem is the problem of describing the fluctuations of the phase boundary in the one-dimensional SOS-model.,R. Dobrushin1 & O.

0,Integrality gaps for strengthened linear relaxations of capacitated facility location,"Metric uncapacitated facility location is a well-studied problem for which linear programming methods have been used with great success in deriving approximation algorithms. Capacitated facility location (Cfl) is a generalization for which there are local-search-based constant-factor approximations, while there is no known compact relaxation with constant integrality gap. This paper produces, through a host of impossibility results, the first comprehensive investigation of the effectiveness of mathematical programming for metric capacitated facility location, with emphasis on lift-and-project methods. We show that the relaxations obtained from the natural LP at \(\varOmega (n)\) levels of the semidefinite Lovász–Schrijver hierarchy for mixed programs, and at \(\varOmega (n)\) levels of the Sherali–Adams hierarchy, have an integrality gap of \(\varOmega (n)\), where \(n\) is the number of facilities, partially answering an open question of An et al. (Centrality of trees for capacitated k-center, 2013), Li and Svensson (Proceedings of 45th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, STOC ’13. ACM, pp 901–910, 2013). For the families of instances we consider, both hierarchies yield at the \(n\)th level an exact formulation for Cfl. Thus our bounds are asymptotically tight. Building on our methodology for the Sherali–Adams result, we prove that the standard Cfl relaxation enriched with the submodular inequalities of Aardal et al. (Math Oper Res 20:562–582, 1995), a generalization of the flow-cover valid inequalities, has also an \(\varOmega (n)\) gap and thus not bounded by any constant. This disproves a long-standing conjecture of Levi et al (Math Program 131(1–2):365–379, 2012). We finally introduce the family of proper relaxations which generalizes to its logical extreme the classic star relaxation and captures general configuration-style LPs. We characterize the behavior of proper relaxations for Cfl through a sharp threshold phenomenon.",Stavros G.

0,Specific Properties of the ODE’s Flow in Dimension Two Versus Dimension Three,"This paper deals with the asymptotics of the ODE’s flow induced by a regular vector field b on the d-dimensional torus \({\mathbb {R}}^d/{\mathbb {Z}}^d\). First, we start by revisiting the Franks-Misiurewicz theorem which claims that the Herman rotation set of any two-dimensional continuous flow is a closed line segment of \({\mathbb {R}}^2\). Various general examples illustrate this result, among which a complete study of the Stepanoff flow associated with a vector field \(b=a\,\zeta \), where \(\zeta \) is a constant vector in \({\mathbb {R}}^2\). Furthermore, several extensions of the Franks-Misiurewicz theorem are obtained in the two-dimensional ODE’s context. On the one hand, we provide some interesting stability properties in the case where the Herman rotation set has a commensurable direction. On the other hand, we present new results highlighting the exceptional character of the opposite case, i.e. when the Herman rotation set is a closed line segment with \(0_{{\mathbb {R}}^2}\) at one end and with an irrational slope, if it is not reduced to a single point. Besides this, given a pair \((\mu ,\nu )\) of invariant probability measures for the flow, we establish new Fourier relations between the determinant \(\det \,(\widehat{\mu b}(j),\widehat{\nu b}(k))\) and the determinant \(\det \,(j,k)\) for any pair (j, k) of non null integer vectors, which can be regarded as an extension of the Franks-Misiurewicz theorem. Next, in contrast with dimension two, any three-dimensional closed convex polyhedron with rational vertices is shown to be the rotation set associated with a suitable vector field b. Finally, in the case of an invariant measure \(\mu \) with a regular density and a non null mass \(\mu (b)\) with respect to b, we show that the homogenization of the two-dimensional transport equation with the oscillating velocity \(b(x/\varepsilon )\) as \(\varepsilon \) tends to 0, leads us to a nonlocal limit transport equation, but with the effective constant velocity \(\mu (b)\).",Marc Briane1 & Loïc Hervé,Journal of Dynamics and Differential Equations,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10884-022-10154-1,"ODE’s flow,Asymptotics,Invariant measure,Rotation set,Fourier coefficients,Homogenization,Transport equation"
0,A Non-intrusive Correction Algorithm for Classification Problems with Corrupted Data,"A novel correction algorithm is proposed for multi-class classification problems with corrupted training data. The algorithm is non-intrusive, in the sense that it post-processes a trained classification model by adding a correction procedure to the model prediction. The correction procedure can be coupled with any approximators, such as logistic regression, neural networks of various architectures, etc. When the training dataset is sufficiently large, we theoretically prove (in the limiting case) and numerically show that the corrected models deliver correct classification results as if there is no corruption in the training data. For datasets of finite size, the corrected models produce significantly better recovery results, compared to the models without the correction algorithm. All of the theoretical findings in the paper are verified by our numerical examples.","Jun Hou1, Tong Qin1, Kailiang Wu1 & …Dongbin Xiu",Communications on Applied Mathematics and Computation,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42967-020-00084-4,"Data corruption,Deep neural network,Cross-entropy,Label corruption,Robust loss"

The controller is unsure about his model in the sense that he also considers a class of approximate models as possibly true. The objective is to choose a maxmin strategy that will work under a range of different model specifications. This is done by dynamic programming techniques. Under relatively weak conditions, we show that there is a solution to the optimality equation for the maxmin control problem as well as an optimal strategy for the controller. These results are applied to the theory of optimal growth and the Hansen–Sargent robust control model in macroeconomics. We also study a class of zero-sum discounted stochastic games with unbounded payoffs and simultaneous moves and give a brief overview of recent results on stochastic games with weakly continuous transitions and the limiting average payoffs.","Anna Jaśkiewicz1 & Andrzej S.

0,A Theoretical and Empirical Comparison of Gradient Approximations in Derivative-Free Optimization,"In this paper, we analyze several methods for approximating gradients of noisy functions using only function values. These methods include finite differences, linear interpolation, Gaussian smoothing, and smoothing on a sphere. The methods differ in the number of functions sampled, the choice of the sample points, and the way in which the gradient approximations are derived. For each method, we derive bounds on the number of samples and the sampling radius which guarantee favorable convergence properties for a line search or fixed step size descent method. To this end, we use the results in Berahas et al. (Global convergence rate analysis of a generic line search algorithm with noise, arXiv:1910.04055, 2019) and show how each method can satisfy the sufficient conditions, possibly only with some sufficiently large probability at each iteration, as happens to be the case with Gaussian smoothing and smoothing on a sphere. Finally, we present numerical results evaluating the quality of the gradient approximations as well as their performance in conjunction with a line search derivative-free optimization algorithm.","Albert S.

0,A stationary Fleming–Viot type Brownian particle system,"We consider a system \({\{X_1,\ldots,X_N\}}\) of N particles in a bounded d-dimensional domain D. During periods in which none of the particles \({X_1,\ldots,X_N}\) hit the boundary \({\partial D}\) , the system behaves like N independent d-dimensional Brownian motions. When one of the particles hits the boundary \({\partial D}\) , then it instantaneously jumps to the site of one of the remaining N − 1 particles with probability (N − 1)−1. For the system \({\{X_1,\ldots,X_N\}}\) , the existence of an invariant measure \({\nu\mskip-12mu \nu}\) has been demonstrated in Burdzy et al. [Comm Math Phys 214(3):679–703, 2000]. We provide a structural formula for this invariant measure \({\nu\mskip-12mu \nu}\) in terms of the invariant measure m of the Markov chain \({\xi}\) which returns the sites the process \({X:=(X_1,\ldots,X_N)}\) jumps to after hitting the boundary \({\partial D^N}\) . In addition, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the invariant measure m of \({\xi}\) when N → ∞. Using the methods of the paper, we provide a rigorous proof of the fact that the stationary empirical measure processes \({\frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N\delta_{X_i}}\) converge weakly as N → ∞ to a deterministic constant motion. This motion is concentrated on the probability measure whose density with respect to the Lebesgue measure is the first eigenfunction of the Dirichlet Laplacian on D.

0,Tests and estimation strategies associated to some loss functions,"We consider the problem of estimating the joint distribution of n independent random variables. Given a loss function and a family of candidate probabilities, that we shall call a model, we aim at designing an estimator with values in our model that possesses good estimation properties not only when the distribution of the data belongs to the model but also when it lies close enough to it. The losses we have in mind are the total variation, Hellinger, Wasserstein and \({\mathbb {L}}_{p}\)-distances to name a few. We show that the risk of our estimator can be bounded by the sum of an approximation term that accounts for the loss between the true distribution and the model and a complexity term that corresponds to the bound we would get if this distribution did belong to the model. Our results hold under mild assumptions on the true distribution of the data and are based on exponential deviation inequalities that are non-asymptotic and involve explicit constants. Interestingly, when the model reduces to two distinct probabilities, our procedure results in a robust test whose errors of first and second kinds only depend on the losses between the true distribution and the two tested probabilities.","Yannick Baraud

0,Nonlinear dynamics and performance analysis of modified snap-through vibration energy harvester with time-varying potential function,"Vibration energy harvesting has emerged as a promising method to harvest energy for small-scale applications. Enhancing the performance of a vibration energy harvester (VEH) incorporating nonlinear techniques, for example, the snap-through VEH with geometric non-linearity, has gained attention in recent years. A conventional snap-through VEH is a bi-stable system with a time-invariant potential function, which was investigated extensively in the past. In this work, a modified snap-through VEH with a time-varying potential function subject to harmonic and random base excitations is investigated. Modified snap-through VEHs, such as the one considered in this study, are used in wave energy harvesters. However, the studies on their dynamics and energy harvesting under harmonic and random excitations are limited. The dynamics of the modified snap-through VEH is represented by a system of differential algebraic equations (DAEs), and the numerical schemes are proposed for its solutions. Under a harmonic excitation, the system exhibits periodic and chaotic motions, and the energy harvesting is superior compared with the conventional counterpart. The dynamics under a random excitation is investigated by the moment differential method and the numerical scheme based on the modified Euler-Maruyama method. The Fokker-Planck equation representing the dynamics is derived, and the marginal and joint probability density functions (PDFs) are obtained by the Monte Carlo simulation. The study shows that the modified snap-through oscillator based VEH performs better under both harmonic and random excitations. The dynamics of the system under stochastic resonance (SR) is investigated, and performance enhancement is observed.

0,On real-valued SDE and nonnegative-valued SDE population models with demographic variability,"Population dynamics with demographic variability is frequently studied using discrete random variables with continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models. An approximation of a CTMC model using continuous random variables can be derived in a straightforward manner by applying standard methods based on the reaction rates in the CTMC model. This leads to a system of Itô stochastic differential equations (SDEs) which generally have the form \( d \mathbf {y} = \varvec{\mu } \, dt + G \, d \mathbf {W},\) where \(\mathbf {y}\) is the population vector of random variables, \(\varvec{\mu }\) is the drift vector, and G is the diffusion matrix. In some problems, the derived SDE model may not have real-valued or nonnegative solutions for all time. For such problems, the SDE model may be declared infeasible. In this investigation, new systems of SDEs are derived with real-valued solutions and with nonnegative solutions. To derive real-valued SDE models, reaction rates are assumed to be nonnegative for all time with negative reaction rates assigned probability zero. This biologically realistic assumption leads to the derivation of real-valued SDE population models. However, small but negative values may still arise for a real-valued SDE model. This is due to the magnitudes of certain problem-dependent diffusion coefficients when population sizes are near zero. A slight modification of the diffusion coefficients when population sizes are near zero ensures that a real-valued SDE model has a nonnegative solution, yet maintains the integrity of the SDE model when sizes are not near zero. Several population dynamic problems are examined to illustrate the methodology.","E. J. Allen

0,Decomposition of Neurological Multivariate Time Series by State Space Modelling,"Decomposition of multivariate time series data into independent source components forms an important part of preprocessing and analysis of time-resolved data in neuroscience. We briefly review the available tools for this purpose, such as Factor Analysis (FA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), then we show how linear state space modelling, a methodology from statistical time series analysis, can be employed for the same purpose. State space modelling, a generalization of classical ARMA modelling, is well suited for exploiting the dynamical information encoded in the temporal ordering of time series data, while this information remains inaccessible to FA and most ICA algorithms. As a result, much more detailed decompositions become possible, and both components with sharp power spectrum, such as alpha components, sinusoidal artifacts, or sleep spindles, and with broad power spectrum, such as FMRI scanner artifacts or epileptic spiking components, can be separated, even in the absence of prior information. In addition, three generalizations are discussed, the first relaxing the independence assumption, the second introducing non-stationarity of the covariance of the noise driving the dynamics, and the third allowing for non-Gaussianity of the data through a non-linear observation function. Three application examples are presented, one electrocardigram time series and two electroencephalogram (EEG) time series. The two EEG examples, both from epilepsy patients, demonstrate the separation and removal of various artifacts, including hum noise and FMRI scanner artifacts, and the identification of sleep spindles, epileptic foci, and spiking components.

0,The limits of weak selection and large population size in evolutionary game theory,"Evolutionary game theory is a mathematical approach to studying how social behaviors evolve. In many recent works, evolutionary competition between strategies is modeled as a stochastic process in a finite population. In this context, two limits are both mathematically convenient and biologically relevant: weak selection and large population size. These limits can be combined in different ways, leading to potentially different results. We consider two orderings: the \(wN\) limit, in which weak selection is applied before the large population limit, and the \(Nw\) limit, in which the order is reversed. Formal mathematical definitions of the \(Nw\) and \(wN\) limits are provided. Applying these definitions to the Moran process of evolutionary game theory, we obtain asymptotic expressions for fixation probability and conditions for success in these limits. We find that the asymptotic expressions for fixation probability, and the conditions for a strategy to be favored over a neutral mutation, are different in the \(Nw\) and \(wN\) limits. However, the ordering of limits does not affect the conditions for one strategy to be favored over another.","Christine Sample

0,A novel similarity-based consensus model for probabilistic linguistic sets and its application in multi-attribute large-scale group decision making,"This paper proposes an improved similarity-based consensus model for large-scale group decision making problem with probabilistic linguistic information. First, we develop a new hesitancy similarity measure for probabilistic linguistic element by considering its probability and scale. The expectation similarity is defined based on the distance measure of the probabilistic linguistic elements. Then a comprehensive similarity measure is constructed by combining the expectation similarity and hesitancy similarity, its desirable properties are discussed in details, which overcomes some limitations of the existing similarity measures. Second, the consensus model is presented which incorporates a similarity-based fuzzy clustering method and feedback mechanism. The clustering method is to classify the large-scale participates into small subgroups, which can facilitate the decision making process. The feedback mechanism is to improve the collective consensus level. Third, a programming model is constructed to determine the weights of attributes. As the decision making environment changes, the weights of attributes change dynamically, which is more reasonable and objective than fixed weights. Finally, the extended TOPSIS method is applied to analyze a case study concerning credit system evaluation. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are verified by comparison analysis and sensitivity analysis.",Yuanyuan Liu1 & Youlong Yang,Computational and Applied Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-021-01684-3,"Large-scale group decision making,Hesitancy degree,Similarity measure,Consensus measure,Feedback mechanism"
0,A GRASP based on DE to solve single machine scheduling problem with SDST,"When handling combinatorial optimization problems, we try to get the optimal arrangement of discrete entities so that the requirements and the constraints are satisfied. These problems become more and more important in various industrial and academic fields. So, over the past years, several techniques have been proposed to solve them. In this paper, we are interested in the single machine scheduling problem with Sequence-Dependent Setup Times, which can be solved through different approaches. We present a hybrid algorithm which combines Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure and Differential Evolution for tackling this problem. Our algorithm is tested on benchmark instances from the literature. The computational experiments prove the efficiency of this algorithm.","Hanen Akrout1, Bassem Jarboui1,2, Patrick Siarry3 & …Abdelwaheb Rebaï",Computational Optimization and Applications,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10589-010-9333-7,"Scheduling single machine,Greedy randomized adaptive search procedure,Differential evolution,Sequence-dependent setup times,Total tardiness"
0,Kac’s program in kinetic theory,"This paper is devoted to the study of propagation of chaos and mean-field limits for systems of indistinguishable particles, undergoing collision processes. The prime examples we will consider are the many-particle jump processes of Kac and McKean (Kac in Proceedings of the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability, 1954–1955, Vol. III, pp. 171–197, 1956; McKean in J. Comb. Theory 2:358–382, 1967) giving rise to the Boltzmann equation. We solve the conjecture raised by Kac (Proceedings of the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability, 1954–1955, Vol. III, pp. 171–197, 1956), motivating his program, on the rigorous connection between the long-time behavior of a collisional many-particle system and the one of its mean-field limit, for bounded as well as unbounded collision rates.Motivated by the inspirative paper by Grünbaum (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 42:323–345, 1971), we develop an abstract method that reduces the question of propagation of chaos to that of proving a purely functional estimate on generator operators (consistency estimates), along with differentiability estimates on the flow of the nonlinear limit equation (stability estimates). This allows us to exploit dissipativity at the level of the mean-field limit equation rather than the level of the particle system (as proposed by Kac).Using this method we show: (1) Quantitative estimates, that are uniform in time, on the chaoticity of a family of states. (2) Propagation of entropic chaoticity, as defined by Carlen et al. (Kinet. Relat. Models 3:85–122, 2010). (3) Estimates on the time of relaxation to equilibrium, that are independent of the number of particles in the system. Our results cover the two main Boltzmann physical collision processes with unbounded collision rates: hard spheres and true Maxwell molecules interactions.

For this model we derive concise integral representations for multi-point q-moments of the height function and for the q-correlation functions. At least in the case of the step initial condition, our formulas degenerate in appropriate limits to many known formulas of such type for integrable probabilistic systems in the (1\(+\)1)d KPZ universality class, including the stochastic six vertex model, ASEP, various q-TASEPs, and associated zero range processes. Our arguments are largely based on properties of a family of symmetric rational functions that can be defined as partition functions of the inhomogeneous higher spin six vertex model for suitable domains. In the homogeneous case, such functions were previously studied in Borodin (On a family of symmetric rational functions, 2014); they also generalize classical Hall–Littlewood and Schur polynomials. A key role is played by Cauchy-like summation identities for these functions, which are obtained as a direct corollary of the Yang–Baxter equation for the higher spin six vertex model.","Alexei Borodin1,2 & Leonid Petrov2,",Selecta Mathematica,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00029-016-0301-7,"Primary 60K35,Secondary 05E05,82B23"

0,The Rado simplicial complex,"We study a remarkable simplicial complex X on countably many vertexes. X is universal in the sense that any countable simplicial complex is an induced subcomplex of X. Additionally, X is homogeneous, i.e. any two isomorphic finite induced subcomplexes are related by an automorphism of X. We prove that X is the unique simplicial complex which is both universal and homogeneous. The 1-skeleton of X is the well-known Rado graph. We show that a random simplicial complex on countably many vertexes is isomorphic to X with probability 1. We prove that the geometric realisation of X is homeomorphic to an infinite dimensional simplex. We observe several curious properties of X, for example we show that X is robust, i.e. removing any finite set of simplexes leaves a simplicial complex isomorphic to X. The robustness of X leads to the hope that suitable finite approximations of X can serve as models for very resilient networks in real life applications. In a forthcoming paper (Even-Zohar et al. Ample simplicial complexes, arXiv:2012.01483, 2020) we study finite approximations to the Rado complex, they can potentially be useful in real life applications due to their structural stability.

0,A pricing problem with unknown arrival rate and price sensitivity,"We study a pricing problem with finite inventory and semi-parametric demand uncertainty. Demand is a price-dependent Poisson process whose mean is the product of buyers’ arrival rate, which is a constant \(\lambda \), and buyers’ purchase probability \(q(p)\), where p is the price. The seller observes arrivals and sales, and knows neither \(\lambda \) nor \(q\). Based on a non-parametric maximum-likelihood estimator of \((\lambda ,q)\), we construct an estimator of mean demand and show that as the system size and number of prices grow, it is asymptotically more efficient than the maximum likelihood estimator based only on sale data. Based on this estimator, we develop a pricing algorithm paralleling (Besbes and Zeevi in Oper Res 57:1407–1420, 2009) and study its performance in an asymptotic regime similar to theirs: the initial inventory and the arrival rate grow proportionally to a scale parameter n. If \(q\) and its inverse function are Lipschitz continuous, then the worst-case regret is shown to be \(O((\log n / n)^{1/4})\). A second model considered is the one in Besbes and Zeevi (2009, Section 4.2), where no arrivals are involved; we modify their algorithm and improve the worst-case regret to \(O((\log n / n)^{1/4})\). In each setting, the regret order is the best known, and is obtained by refining their proof methods. We also prove an \(\Omega (n^{-1/2})\) lower bound on the regret. Numerical comparisons to state-of-the-art alternatives indicate the effectiveness of our arrivals-based approach.","Athanassios N. Avramidis

(N)=0, 1≤i≤N, conditioned not to intersect. The edge-scaling limit of this system is obtained by taking a weak limit as N→∞ of the collection of curves scaled so that the point (0,21/2
N) is fixed and space is squeezed, horizontally by a factor of N
2/3 and vertically by N
1/3. If a parabola is added to each of the curves of this scaling limit, an x-translation invariant process sometimes called the multi-line Airy process is obtained. We prove the existence of a version of this process (which we call the Airy line ensemble) in which the curves are almost surely everywhere continuous and non-intersecting. This process naturally arises in the study of growth processes and random matrix ensembles, as do related processes with “wanderers” and “outliers”. We formulate our results to treat these relatives as well.Note that the law of the finite collection of Brownian bridges above has the property—called the Brownian Gibbs property—of being invariant under the following action. Select an index 1≤k≤N and erase B

k

Prähofer and H. Spohn that each line of the Airy line ensemble is locally absolutely continuous with respect to Brownian motion. We also obtain a proof of the long-standing conjecture of K. Johansson that the top line of the Airy line ensemble minus a parabola attains its maximum at a unique point. This establishes the asymptotic law of the transversal fluctuation of last passage percolation with geometric weights.

0,Mixed-volume computation by dynamic lifting applied to polynomial system solving,"The aim of this paper is to present a flexible approach for the efficient computation of the mixed volume of a tuple of polytopes. In order to compute the mixed volume, a mixed subdivision of the tuple of polytopes is needed, which can be obtained by embedding the polytopes in a higher-dimensional space, i.e., by lifting them. Dynamic lifting is opposed to the static approach. This means that one considers one point at a time and only fixes the value of the lifting function when the point really influences the mixed volume. Conservative lifting functions have been developed for this purpose. This provides us with a deterministic manipulation of the lifting for computing mixed volumes, which rules out randomness conditions. Cost estimates for the algorithm are given. The implications of dynamic lifting on polyhedral homotopy methods for the solution of polynomial systems are investigated and applications are presented.","J. Verschelde1, K. Gatermann2 & R.

As the mathematical formalism, we use the same weighted least-squares method to approximate the Anderson discriminant function in the neighborhood of zero values both in solving the classification problem and in evaluating posterior probabilities of classes at a given point in the feature space. In the support vector method, the classification problem is solved by solving a quadratic programming problem with the number of constraints equal to the number of rows in the training sample, and to evaluate posterior probabilities of the classes an additional tool is used, namely the Platt calibrator, which converts the distance of the point to the boundary to the posterior probability of the class; the calibrator’s parameters are found with the maximum likelihood method. Using several examples of solving classification problems, we compare the performance of the methods by the criterion of empirical risk.

0,Creating the Applied Subject Area Ontology by Means of the Content of the Digital Semantic Library,"AbstractThis article is devoted to the problem of including a subject area in a semantic library. The subject area is considered, which was not previously presented in part of the ontology of the digital library. A method based on the technology of establishing semantic links with the already accumulated content of the library is proposed. Main idea of the inclusion method is to use dictionaries, thesauri and links to the mathematical encyclopedia. They are used to attach a new scientific publication metadata set to an existing library metadata set. In the course of preliminary processing of texts of scientific publications, their semantic analysis is carried out and a local description of the subject area of this array is formed within the content of the library. Such subject areas as ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, equations of continuum mechanics, equations of composite mechanics and their solutions expressed in terms of special functions of mathematical physics are considered. The description of the mathematical encyclopedia in its classical form is the central resource. It allows us to identify the appropriate classifiers through the links of the equations of applied problems and their solutions and use them also to form a description of the subject area. This subject area is new and has not been described in our digital library before. Proposed procedure is made possible only by data integration in the library. This takes into account the expansion of the description of subject areas related to the applications of mathematics in interdisciplinary research and technology. The implementation of this procedure is one of the new directions for filling the semantic libraries. It uses the approach of data integration and saturation with connections that are revealed only in the process of analyzing new data. If new references are found in the library during the process of adding a new description, then this method will also make it possible to identify and fill in the gaps in the description of related areas of mathematics, such as applications of solutions to classical problems of mathematical physics.","O.

Zadeh’s Z-number considers information fuzziness and reliability, and can, therefore, help the decision-maker to manage complicated problems. However, due to its complex construct, several issues concerning the computation of Z-numbers require further research. This study develops a novel likelihood-based method of comparing two  Z-numbers to solve multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. Four main parts can be outlined. First, the likelihood of fuzzy restriction of Z-numbers is defined based on the conversion method of Z-number. Second, the likelihood of underlying probability distributions of Z-numbers is also proposed to compare the difference of randomness of Z-information. Third, by adding to a risk preference parameter, this study constructs a comprehensive weighted likelihood of Z-numbers. Finally, a likelihood-based qualitative flexible approach is extended to address the MCDM problems under Z-evaluation. In addition, a numerical example of the selection of ERP systems for ABC enterprise is placed to illustrate the applicability, validity, and effectiveness of the proposed method.","Dong Qiao1, Yi-ting Wang1, Jian-qiang Wang1, Hanyang Luo2 & …Lin Li",Computational and Applied Mathematics,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-020-01167-x,"Z-numbers,Multi-criteria decision-making,QUALIFLEX,Likelihood"

0,Moderate deviations for systems of slow–fast stochastic reaction–diffusion equations,"The goal of this paper is to study the moderate deviation principle for a system of stochastic reaction–diffusion equations with a time-scale separation in slow and fast components and small noise in the slow component. Based on weak convergence methods in infinite dimensions and related stochastic control arguments, we obtain an exact form for the moderate deviations rate function in different regimes as the small noise and time-scale separation parameters vanish. Many issues that appear due to the infinite dimensionality of the problem are completely absent in their finite-dimensional counterpart. In comparison to corresponding large deviation principles, the moderate deviation scaling necessitates a more delicate approach to establishing tightness and properly identifying the limiting behavior of the underlying controlled problem. The latter involves regularity properties of a solution of an associated elliptic Kolmogorov equation on Hilbert space along with a finite-dimensional approximation argument.

0,A Novel Weakly-Intrusive Non-linear Multiresolution Framework for Uncertainty Quantification in Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations,"In this paper, a novel multiresolution framework, namely the Truncate and Encode (TE) approach, previously proposed by some of the authors (Abgrall et al. in J Comput Phys 257:19–56, 2014. doi:10.1016/j.jcp.2013.08.006), is generalized and extended for taking into account uncertainty in partial differential equations (PDEs). Innovative ingredients are given by an algorithm permitting to recover the multiresolution representation without requiring the fully resolved solution, the possibility to treat a whatever form of pdf and the use of high-order (even non-linear, i.e. data-dependent) reconstruction in the stochastic space. Moreover, the spatial-TE method is introduced, which is a weakly intrusive scheme for uncertainty quantification (UQ), that couples the physical and stochastic spaces by minimizing the computational cost for PDEs. The proposed scheme is particularly attractive when treating moving discontinuities (such as shock waves in compressible flows), even if they appear during the simulations as it is common in unsteady aerodynamics applications. The proposed method is very flexible since it can easily coupled with different deterministic schemes, even with high-resolution features. Flexibility and performances of the present method are demonstrated on various numerical test cases (algebraic functions and ordinary differential equations), including partial differential equations, both linear and non-linear, in presence of randomness. The efficiency of the proposed strategy for solving stochastic linear advection and Burgers equation is shown by comparison with some classical techniques for UQ, namely Monte Carlo or the non-intrusive polynomial chaos methods.","Gianluca Geraci1, Pietro Marco Congedo2, Rémi Abgrall3 & …Gianluca Iaccarino",Journal of Scientific Computing,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-015-0026-3,"Multiresolution,Uncertainty quantification,Adaptive grid,ENO,MUSCL,Hyperbolic conservation laws"

0,Lengths of monotone subsequences in a Mallows permutation,"We study the length of the longest increasing and longest decreasing subsequences of random permutations drawn from the Mallows measure. Under this measure, the probability of a permutation \(\uppi \in S_n\) is proportional to \(q^{\mathrm{Inv }(\uppi )}\) where \(q\) is a real parameter and \(\mathrm{Inv }(\uppi )\) is the number of inversions in \(\uppi \). The case \(q=1\) corresponds to uniformly random permutations. The Mallows measure was introduced by Mallows in connection with ranking problems in statistics. We determine the typical order of magnitude of the lengths of the longest increasing and decreasing subsequences, as well as large deviation bounds for them. We also provide a simple bound on the variance of these lengths, and prove a law of large numbers for the length of the longest increasing subsequence. Assuming without loss of generality that \(q<1\), our results apply when \(q\) is a function of \(n\) satisfying \(n(1-q) \rightarrow \infty \). The case that \(n(1-q)=O(1)\) was considered previously by Mueller and Starr. In our parameter range, the typical length of the longest increasing subsequence is of order \(n\sqrt{1-q}\), whereas the typical length of the longest decreasing subsequence has four possible behaviors according to the precise dependence of \(n\) and \(q\). We show also that in the graphical representation of a Mallows-distributed permutation, most points are found in a symmetric strip around the diagonal whose width is of order \(1/(1-q)\). This suggests a connection between the longest increasing subsequence in the Mallows model and the model of last passage percolation in a strip.",Nayantara Bhatnagar1 & Ron Peled,Probability Theory and Related Fields,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-014-0559-7,"60C05,60F10,60F25,60B15,05A05"

With this aim, we introduce the concept of an adaptive control Lyapunov function for stochastic systems and we use the stochastic version of Artstein's theorem to design an adaptive stabilizer. In this framework the problem of adaptive stabilization of a nonlinear stochastic system is reduced to the problem of asymptotic stabilization in probability of a modified system. The design of an adaptive control Lyapunov function is illustrated by the example of adaptively quadratically stabilizable in probability stochastic differential systems.",P.

0,Evolution of condition-dependent dispersal under kin competition,"Dispersers often differ in body condition from non-dispersers. The social dominance hypothesis explains dispersal of weak individuals, but it is not yet well understood why strong individuals, which could easily retain their natal site, are sometimes exposed to risky dispersal. Based on the model for dispersal under kin competition by Hamilton and May, we construct a model where dispersal propensity depends on body condition. We consider an annual species that inhabits a patchy environment with varying patch qualities. Offspring body condition corresponds to the quality of the natal patch and competitive ability increases with body condition. Our main general result balances the fitness benefit from not dispersing and retaining the natal patch and the benefit from dispersing and establishing somewhere else. We present four different examples for competition, which all hint that dispersal of strong individuals may be a common outcome under the assumptions of the present model. In three of the examples, the evolutionarily stable dispersal probability is an increasing function of body condition. However, we found an example where, counterintuitively, the evolutionarily stable dispersal probability is a non-monotone function of body condition such that both very weak and very strong individuals disperse with high probability but individuals of intermediate body condition do not disperse at all.","Mats Gyllenberg1, Éva Kisdi1 & Margarete Utz",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-008-0158-2,"Adaptive dynamics,Condition-dependent dispersal,Evolution,ESS,Function-valued trait,Kin competition,Spatially structured population"

Primary customers get in the system according to a Poisson process, and they will receive service immediately if the server is available upon arrival. Otherwise, they will enter a retrial orbit and are queued in the orbit in accordance with a first-come-first-served (FCFS) discipline. Customers are allowed to balk and renege at particular times. All customers demand the first “essential” service, whereas only some of them demand the second “multi-optional” service. It is assumed that the retrial time, service time and repair time of the server are all arbitrarily distributed. The necessary and sufficient condition for the system stability is derived.

0,"Cost Optimization of the Queueing System with Degrading Service Rate, Bernoulli Vacation, and a Regular Vacation After Fixed Services","Due to the continuous work, degradation in the working capacity of machines and servers is an inevitable phenomenon. To analyze this type of situation in queueing systems, we considered the degradation in the service rate of the server. For the maintenance purpose, vacation is given after completion of a threshold number of services. After maintenance, the server will start working in the fresh mode, that is, with the initial service rate. The impatient behavior of customers and unreliability of the server are also included, which make our model more realistic. We derived the stability condition for this model and found out the steady state probabilities using matrix geometric method. All the system performance measures are calculated. An expected cost function is constructed and is optimized using the particle swarm optimization method. Effects of degrading service rate as well as breakdown rate and vacation rate are studied on the key measures and the expected cost function.

In this article, our focus is on a specific class of problems namely stochastic MAB problems where the rewards are stochastic. In particular, we emphasize stochastic MAB problems with strategic agents. Dealing with strategic agents warrants the use of mechanism design principles in conjunction with online learning, and leads to non-trivial technical challenges. In this paper, we first provide three motivating problems arising from Internet advertising, crowdsourcing, and smart grids. Next, we provide an overview of stochastic MAB problems and key associated learning algorithms including upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithms. We provide proofs of important results related to regret analysis of the above learning algorithms. Following this, we present mechanism design for stochastic MAB problems. With the classic example of sponsored search auctions as a backdrop, we bring out key insights in important issues such as regret lower bounds, exploration separated mechanisms, designing truthful mechanisms, UCB based mechanisms, and extension to multiple pull MAB problems. Finally we provide a bird’s eye view of recent results in the area and present a few issues that require immediate future attention.","Shweta Jain1, Satyanath Bhat1, Ganesh Ghalme1, Divya Padmanabhan1 & …Y.

i
 (proportion of neighbors of typei). The set of neighbors of a sitex is of the form {y:‖x−y‖≦J}, for a positive integerJ and a norm ‖·‖. Assuming there are only 0's and 1's present at the beginning, the process reduces to the contact process, with the critical rate of survival of 1's being λ

If λ2 > λ1, and the initial state is translation invariant and contains infinitely many 2's, then the 1's go away and the process approaches the invariant measure of the contact process with only 2's and 0's present,

If λ2 = λ1, andd≦2, then clustering occurs: starting from a translation invariant initial measure with no mass on all 0's, the process converges weakly to a convex combination of the two invariant measures obtained with only one type of particles present, and

This allows us to describe the stochastic evolutionary game dynamics when three players are assigned different roles and therefore are not interchangeable. Following previous studies, we also derived two types of stochastic stability conditions based on the obtained fixation probabilities; “strong stochastic stability,” which requires that for any initial frequencies of strategies, the fixation probability of a combination of specific strategies is higher than that under neutrality and those of any other combinations are lower than neutrality; and “stochastic stability,” which only requires that the fixation probability of a specific strategy combination be higher than that under neutrality for any initial frequencies of strategies. Thus, for the former, we obtain a clear correspondence with bimatrix games, but not necessarily for the latter. The results of applying our findings to triadic conflicts (the Impartial person and mediator game and the Fish in troubled waters game), the volunteer’s dilemma, and coordination games are also reported.","Takuya Sekiguchi

We here present a model for the effect of exposure to agents causing or inducing the disease on the incidence of morbidity. The proposed model is an expansion of the SIR model to non-contagious diseases and aims to estimate the balance between immunization and disease probability. The model results indicate that, paradoxically in a wide range of parameters, a decrease in exposure to the disease inducing agent results in an increase in disease incidence. This can occur if: (a) the probability of developing disease, given an exposure to the agent increases with age, (b) immunity to the agent is long. The inverse relation between exposure and disease incidence results from a decrease in the adult immunized population following a previous decrease in the exposure rate. Therefore, a lower exposure can lead to lower incidence in the short term but to higher incidence in the long term.","Orit Lavi1, Eyal Klement2 & Yoram Louzoun",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-010-9554-z,"Hygiene model,Linear SIR,Immunity,Listeriosis"
0,Comparison of the Bayesian and Randomised Decision Tree Ensembles within an Uncertainty Envelope Technique,"Multiple Classifier Systems (MCSs) allow evaluation of the uncertainty of classification outcomes that is of crucial importance for safety critical applications. The uncertainty of classification is determined by a trade-off between the amount of data available for training, the classifier diversity and the required performance. The interpretability of MCSs can also give useful information for experts responsible for making reliable classifications. For this reason Decision Trees (DTs) seem to be attractive classification models for experts. The required diversity of MCSs exploiting such classification models can be achieved by using two techniques, the Bayesian model averaging and the randomised DT ensemble. Both techniques have revealed promising results when applied to real-world problems. In this paper we experimentally compare the classification uncertainty of the Bayesian model averaging with a restarting strategy and the randomised DT ensemble on a synthetic dataset and some domain problems commonly used in the machine learning community. To make the Bayesian DT averaging feasible, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. The classification uncertainty is evaluated within an Uncertainty Envelope technique dealing with the class posterior distribution and a given confidence probability. Exploring a full posterior distribution, this technique produces realistic estimates which can be easily interpreted in statistical terms. In our experiments we found out that the Bayesian DTs are superior to the randomised DT ensembles within the Uncertainty Envelope technique.","Vitaly Schetinin1, Jonathan E.

Our analysis starts with the ecological model which was first introduced and analyzed by Calsina and Ripoll (Math Biosci 208(2), 393–418, 2007). The structure of the population is extended to a genotype class and a new model for an invading/mutant population is introduced. The invasion fitness functional is derived from the ecological setting, and it turns out to be controlled by a formula of Shaw–Mohler type. The problem of finding evolutionarily stable strategies is solved by means of infinite-dimensional linear optimization. We have found that these strategies correspond to sex-reversal at a single particular age (or size) even if the set of feasible strategies is considerably broader and allows for a probabilistic sex-reversal. Several examples, including in addition the population-dynamical stability, are illustrated.

We only assume that the stochastic algorithm exhibits a weak* convergence to a probability measure assigning all its mass to the discretized problem.

In practice they have been applied to solve some presumably hard (e.g., NP-complete) problems. The level of performance obtained has been promising [2,5,6,14]. The success of this heuristic technique has motivated analysis of this algorithm from a theoretical point of view. In particular, people have looked at the convergence of this algorithm. They have shown (see e.g., [10]) that this algorithm converges in the limit to a globally optimal solution with probability 1. However few of these convergence results specify a time limit within which the algorithm is guaranteed to converge (with some high probability, say). We present, for the first time, a simple analysis of SA that will provide a time bound for convergence with overwhelming probability. The analysis will hold no matter what annealing schedule is used. Convergence of Simulated Annealing in the limit will follow as a corollary to our time convergence proof. In this paper we also look at optimization problems for which the cost function has some special properties. We prove that for these problems the convergence is much faster. In particular, we give a simpler and more general proof of convergence for Nested Annealing, a heuristic algorithm developed in [12]. Nested Annealing is based on defining a graph corresponding to the given optimization problem. If this graph is ‘small separable’, they [12] show that Nested Annealing will converge ‘faster’. For an arbitrary optimization problem, we may not have any knowledge about the ‘separability’ of its graph. In this paper we give tight bounds for the ‘separability’ of a random graph. We then use these bounds to analyze the expected behavior of Nested Annealing on an arbitrary optimization problem. The ‘separability’ bounds we derive in this paper are of independent interest and have the potential of finding other applications.",Sanguthevar Rajasekaran,Journal of Global Optimization,2000,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1008307523936,"Cost Function,Simulated Annealing,Combinatorial Optimization,Special Property,Heuristic Algorithm"

In all of these contexts, the fungi are growing in environments exhibiting spatio-temporal nutritional and structural heterogeneities. In this work, a discrete mathematical model is derived that allows detailed understanding of how events at the hyphal level are influenced by the nature of various environmental heterogeneities. Mycelial growth and function is simulated in a range of environments including homogeneous conditions, nutritionally-heterogeneous conditions and structurally-heterogeneous environments, the latter emulating porous media such as soils.

0,A multi-objective approach for PH-graphs with applications to stochastic shortest paths,"Stochastic shortest path problems (SSPPs) have many applications in practice and are subject of ongoing research for many years. This paper considers a variant of SSPPs where times or costs to pass an edge in a graph are, possibly correlated, random variables. There are two general goals one can aim for, the minimization of the expected costs to reach the destination or the maximization of the probability to reach the destination within a given budget. Often one is interested in policies that build a compromise between different goals which results in multi-objective problems. In this paper, an algorithm to compute the convex hull of Pareto optimal policies that consider expected costs and probabilities of falling below given budgets is developed. The approach uses the recently published class of PH-graphs that allow one to map SSPPs, even with generally distributed and correlated costs associated to edges, on Markov decision processes (MDPs) and apply the available techniques for MDPs to compute optimal policies.

0,Contribution to the linkage theory of autopolyploids: I,"A theory of linkage of autopolyploids is developed under consideration ofm loci andr alleles. The simplifying assumption of chromosome segregation, which may be considered as an approximation to the more adequate theory of chromatid segregation, is made throughout. Random mating and distinct, non-overlapping generations are assumed. Under these assumptions the problem is determined by three basic probability distributions—the distributions of genotypes and of gametes, and the segregation distribution. The segregation distribution is assumed to be the same for males and for females. The aim of the paper is to establish recurrence formulas (which allow to find the distributions of gametes and of genotypes from generation to generation, if the distribution of genotypes for an initial generation is known) and to investigate the limit behavior of these distributions as the number of generations increases indefinitely.In the present paper (hereafter referred to as I) the problem is explained, and the three characteristic distributions are introduced for the general case of a 2s-ploid,m loci, andr alleles. Recurrence relations are established for tetraploids,s=2 andm=2 loci, while the recurrence relations for the general case as well as the limit theorems will be given in the second part of this paper (hereafter referred to as II).",Hilda Geiringer,The bulletin of mathematical biophysics,1949,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02477494,"Marginal Distribution,Haldane,Chromosome Segregation,Marginal Probability,Recurrence Formula"

Due to increasing demands for performance improvement together with reduced weight and costs the introduction of uncertainties into optimization problems in mechanical engineering is also necessary. In a number of papers this Stochastic Structural Optimization Problem is formulated and solved only within certain limiting assumptions. This paper presents a general definition of the Stochastic Structural Optimization Problem. Furthermore one solution technique based on reliability calculation is presented.

0,Modeling Cell Dynamics in Colon and Intestinal Crypts: The Significance of Central Stem Cells in Tumorigenesis,"Colon and intestinal crypts have been widely chosen to study cell dynamics because of their fairly simple structures. In the colon and intestinal crypts, stem cells (SCs) are located at very bottom of the crypt, fully differentiated cells (FDs) are located in the top of the crypt, and transit-amplifying cells (TAs) are in the middle of the crypt between FDs and SCs. Recently, it has been discovered that there are two types of stem cells in the intestinal crypts: central stem cells (CeSCs) and border stem cells. To investigate dynamics of mutants in colon and intestinal crypts, we develop a four-compartmental stochastic model, which includes two SC compartments, and TAs and FDs compartments. We calculate the probability of the progeny of marked or mutant cells located at each of these compartments taking over the entire crypt or being washed out from the crypt. We found that the progeny of CeSCs will take over the entire crypt with a probability close to one. Interestingly, the progeny of advantageous mutant TAs and FDs will be washed out faster than disadvantageous mutants. Saliently, the model predicts that the time that the progeny of wild-type central stem cells will take over the mouse intestinal crypt is around 60 days, which is in perfect agreement with an experimental observation.","Ali Mahdipour-Shirayeh1,2 na1 & Leili Shahriyari3 na",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-018-0457-8,"Stem cell niche,Bi-compartmental stochastic model,Fixation probability,Cancer,Cell migration,Central and border stem cells"
0,Globalized robust Markov perfect equilibrium for discounted stochastic games and its application on intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks: Part I—theory,"In this article, we study a discounted stochastic game to model resource optimal intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. To address the problem of uncertainties in various network parameters, we propose a globalized robust game-theoretic framework for discounted robust stochastic games. A robust solution to the considered problem is an optimal point that is feasible for all realizations of data from a given uncertainty set. To allow a controlled violation of the constraints when the parameters move out of the uncertainty set, the concept of globalized robust framework comes into view. In this article, we formulate a globalized robust counterpart for the discounted stochastic game under consideration. With the help of globalized robust optimization, a concept of globalized robust Markov perfect equilibrium is introduced. The existence of such an equilibrium is shown for a discounted stochastic game when the number of actions of the players is finite. The contraction mapping theorem, Kakutani fixed point theorem and the concept of equicontinuity are used to prove the existence result. To compute a globalized robust Markov perfect equilibrium for the considered discounted stochastic game, a tractable representation of the proposed globalized robust counterpart is also provided. Using the derived tractable representation, we formulate a globalized robust intrusion detection system for wireless sensor networks.","Debdas Ghosh

His algorithm is excellent, but certain difficulties arise in trying to use it (or the original von Neumann scheme) to generate bits in expected linear time from a Markov chain.In this paper, we return to the original one-coin von Neumann scheme, and show how to extend it to generate an independent unbiased sequence ofHs andTs from any Markov chain in expected linear time. We give a wrong and a right way to do this. Two algorithms A and B use the simple von Neumann trick on every state of the Markov chain. They differ in the time they choose to announce the coin flip.

0,Random Sampling with Removal,"We study randomized algorithms for constrained optimization, in abstract frameworks that include, in strictly increasing generality: convex programming; LP-type problems; violator spaces; and a setting we introduce, consistent spaces. Such algorithms typically involve a step of finding the optimal solution for a random sample of the constraints. They exploit the condition that, in finite dimension \(\delta \), this sample optimum violates a provably small expected fraction of the non-sampled constraints, with the fraction decreasing in the sample size r. We extend such algorithms by considering the technique of removal, where a fixed number k of constraints are removed from the sample according to a fixed rule, with the goal of improving the solution quality. This may have the effect of increasing the number of violated non-sampled constraints. We study this increase, and bound it in a variety of general settings. This work is motivated by, and extends, results on removal as proposed for chance-constrained optimization. For many relevant values of r, \(\delta \), and k, we prove matching upper and lower bounds for the expected number of constraints violated by a random sample, after the removal of k constraints. For a large range of values of k, the new upper bounds improve the previously best bounds for LP-type problems, which moreover had only been known in special cases, and not in the generality we consider. Moreover, we show that our results extend from finite to infinite spaces, for chance-constrained optimization.","Kenneth L.

Sampling the quadrics independently from the Kostlan ensemble, as \(n \rightarrow \infty \) we show that for each \(i\ge 0\) the expected ith Betti number satisfies $$\begin{aligned} \mathbb {E}b_i(X)=1+O(n^{-M})\quad \text {for all } M>0. \end{aligned}$$In other words, each fixed Betti number of X is asymptotically expected to be one; in fact as long as \(i=i(n)\) is sufficiently bounded away from n / 2 the above rate of convergence is uniform (and in this range Betti numbers concentrate to their expected value). For the special case \(k=2\) we study the expectation of the sum of all Betti numbers of X. It was recently shown (Lerario, in Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 143:3239–3251, 2015) that this expected sum equals \(n+o(n)\); here we sharpen this asymptotic, showing that $$\begin{aligned} \sum _{j=0}^n\mathbb {E}b_j(X)=n + \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi }}n^{1/2} + O(n^c) \quad \text {for any } c>0 \end{aligned}$$

In particular (1) is based on a reduction that requires an average count of the number of singular quadrics in a random pencil; this count turns out to be related to the derivative at zero of the gap probability \(f_{\beta , n}\) in finite Gaussian \(\beta \)-ensembles (\(\beta =1,2,4\)).

0,Bayesian-Weighted Triplet and Quartet Methods for Species Tree Inference,"Inference of the evolutionary histories of species, commonly represented by a species tree, is complicated by the divergent evolutionary history of different parts of the genome. Different loci on the genome can have different histories from the underlying species tree (and each other) due to processes such as incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), gene duplication and loss, and horizontal gene transfer. The multispecies coalescent is a commonly used model for performing inference on species and gene trees in the presence of ILS. This paper introduces Lily-T and Lily-Q, two new methods for species tree inference under the multispecies coalescent. We then compare them to two frequently used methods, SVDQuartets and ASTRAL, using simulated and empirical data. Both methods generally showed improvement over SVDQuartets, and Lily-Q was superior to Lily-T for most simulation settings. The comparison to ASTRAL was more mixed—Lily-Q tended to be better than ASTRAL when the length of recombination-free loci was short, when the coalescent population parameter \(\theta \) was small, or when the internal branch lengths were longer.","Andrew Richards1 & Laura Kubatko

The stability and quantification of the rate of convergence of the Mapper to the Reeb space has been studied a lot in recent works (Brown et al. in CoRR. arXiv:1909.03488, 2019; Carrière and Oudot in Found Comput Math 18(6):1333–1396, 2017; Carrière et al. in J Mach Learn Res 19(12):1–39, 2018; Munch and Wang in: 32nd international symposium on computational geometry (SoCG 2016), Schloss Dagstuhl–Leibniz-Zentrum fuer Informatik, 51: 53:1–53:16, 2016), focusing on the case where a scalar-valued filter is used for the computation of Mapper. On the other hand, much less is known in the multivariate case, when the codomain of the filter is \({\mathbb {R}}^p\), and in the general case, when it is a general metric space \((\mathcal {Z},d_\mathcal {Z})\), instead of \({\mathbb {R}}\). The few results that are available in this setting (Dey et al. in: 33rd international symposium on computational geometry (SoCG 2017), Schloss Dagstuhl–Leibniz-Zentrum fuer Informatik, 77, 36:1–36:16, 2017; Munch and Wang, 2016) can only handle continuous topological spaces and cannot be used as is for finite metric spaces representing data, such as point clouds and distance matrices. In this article, we introduce a slight modification of the usual Mapper construction and we give risk bounds for estimating the Reeb space using this estimator. Our approach applies in particular to the setting where the filter function used to compute Mapper is also estimated from data, such as the eigenfunctions of PCA. Our results are given with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, computed with specific filter-based pseudometrics for Mappers and Reeb spaces defined in Dey et al. (2017). We finally provide examples of this setting in statistics and machine learning for different kinds of target filters, as well as numerical experiments that demonstrate the relevance of our approach.

0,Contributions to the theory of imitative behavior,"The imitation effects in a social group depend both on the size of the group and on the distribution of a certain psychobiological quantity ϕ which measures the tendency of an individual towards a given behavior. The distribution function of ϕ determines the ratio μ of the individuals in the society who adopt a given behavior. When the size of the social group is not too large, the actual distribution of ϕ will deviate from the most probable one, and therefore communities of the same size and having the same parameters may have different values of μ. Approximate equations are developed which give the probability of a given μ for a group of a given size. Possible effects of interactions of communities of different sizes are briefly discussed. A generalization of the theory of imitative behavior to any number of mutually exclusive behaviors is given, and its possible sociological implications are discussed.",N.

0,Bayesian Parameter Identification for Turing Systems on Stationary and Evolving Domains,"In this study, we apply the Bayesian paradigm for parameter identification to a well-studied semi-linear reaction–diffusion system with activator-depleted reaction kinetics, posed on stationary as well as evolving domains. We provide a mathematically rigorous framework to study the inverse problem of finding the parameters of a reaction–diffusion system given a final spatial pattern. On the stationary domain the parameters are finite-dimensional, but on the evolving domain we consider the problem of identifying the evolution of the domain, i.e. a time-dependent function. Whilst others have considered these inverse problems using optimisation techniques, the Bayesian approach provides a rigorous mathematical framework for incorporating the prior knowledge on uncertainty in the observation and in the parameters themselves, resulting in an approximation of the full probability distribution for the parameters, given the data. Furthermore, using previously established results, we can prove well-posedness results for the inverse problem, using the well-posedness of the forward problem. Although the numerical approximation of the full probability is computationally expensive, parallelised algorithms make the problem solvable using high-performance computing.","Eduard Campillo-Funollet

0,"Aspects of the Clausius-Shannon Identity: Emphasis on the components of transitive information in linear, branched and composite physical systems","In this paper I consider how information is required to specify various systems. It is shown that the transitive information of any physical system, is distributed among three distinct components. One of these, the selective component, is required to specify the elemental parts of the system. Another, the connective component, is required to specify the macrostructure of the system; that is the way the parts are put together. And a third, the conformative component, is required to specify the intrinsic complexion or microstructure of the system. An interesting method for analyzing branched systems which takes account of connective ambiguity is described in some detail. The relationship between information and entropy, known as the Clausius-Shannon Identity, is then discussed with reference to selected thermodynamic models: and that aspect of information which is often overlooked, namely the distinction, between transitive and intransitive information is highlighted. The applications (or perhaps more correctly, the limitations of applying this treatment) to problems of biological interest are also indicated.",J.

0,Why protective measurement does not establish the reality of the quantum state,"“Protective measurement” refers to two related schemes for finding the expectation value of an observable without disturbing the state of a quantum system, given a single copy of the system that is subject to a “protecting” operation. There have been several claims that these schemes support interpreting the quantum state as an objective property of a single quantum system. Here we provide three counter-arguments, each of which we present in two versions tailored to the two different schemes. Our first argument shows that the same resources used in protective measurement can be used to reconstruct the quantum state in a different way via process tomography. Our second argument is based on exact analyses of special cases of protective measurement, and our final argument is to construct explicit “\(\psi \)-epistemic” toy models for protective measurement, which strongly suggest that protective measurement does not imply the reality of the quantum state. The common theme of the three arguments is that almost all of the information comes from the “protection” operation rather than the quantum state of the system, and hence the schemes have no implications for the reality of the quantum state.","Joshua Combes

By using renewal process theory and total probability decomposition technique, the authors study the transient and equilibrium properties of the queue length from the beginning of the arbitrary initial state, and obtain both the recursive expression of the z-transformation of the transient queue length distribution and the recursive formula for calculating the steady state queue length at arbitrary time epoch n

0,The modern tontine,"We investigate whether a historical pension concept, the tontine, yields enough innovative potential to extend and improve the prevailing privately funded pension solutions in a modern way. The tontine basically generates an age-increasing cash flow, which can help to match the increasing financing needs at old ages. In contrast to traditional pension products, however, the tontine generates volatile cash flows, which means that the insurance character of the tontine cannot be guaranteed in every situation. By employing Multi Cumulative Prospect Theory (MCPT) we answer the question to what extent tontines can be a complement to or a substitute for traditional annuities. We find that it is only optimal to invest in tontines for a certain range of initial wealth. In addition, we investigate in how far the tontine size, the volatility of individual liquidity needs and expected mortality rates contribute to the demand for tontines.","Jan-Hendrik Weinert

0,A Simple Proof of the Restricted Isometry Property for Random Matrices,"
We give a simple technique for verifying the Restricted Isometry Property (as introduced by Candès and Tao) for random matrices that underlies Compressed Sensing. Our approach has two main ingredients: (i) concentration inequalities for random inner products that have recently provided algorithmically simple proofs of the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma; and (ii) covering numbers for finite-dimensional balls in Euclidean space. This leads to an elementary proof of the Restricted Isometry Property and brings out connections between Compressed Sensing and the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma. As a result, we obtain simple and direct proofs of Kashin’s theorems on widths of finite balls in Euclidean space (and their improvements due to Gluskin) and proofs of the existence of optimal Compressed Sensing measurement matrices. In the process, we also prove that these measurements have a certain universality with respect to the sparsity-inducing basis.

0,Modelling parameter uncertainty for risk capital calculation,"For risk capital calculation within the framework of Solvency II the possible loss of basic own funds over the next business year of an insurance undertaking is usually interpreted as a random variable \( \varvec{X} \). If we assume that the parametric distribution family \(\left\{ \varvec{X} (\theta )|\theta \in I\subseteq \mathbb {R}^d \right\} \) is known, but the parameter \(\theta \) is unknown and has to be estimated from the available historical data, the undertaking faces parameter uncertainty. To assess methods to model parameter uncertainty for risk capital calculations we apply a criterion going back to the theory of predictive inference which has already been used in the context of Solvency II. In particular, we show that the bootstrapping approach is not appropriate to model parameter uncertainty from the undertaking’s perspective. Based on ideas closely related to the concept of fiducial inference we introduce a new approach to model parameter uncertainty. For a wide class of distributions and for common estimators including the maximum likelihood method we prove that this approach is appropriate to model parameter uncertainty according to the criterion mentioned above. Several examples demonstrate that our method can easily be applied in practice.",Andreas Fröhlich1 & Annegret Weng,European Actuarial Journal,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13385-015-0109-4,"Parameter uncertainty,Solvency II,Internal model,Solvency capital requirement,Bootstrapping,Predictive inference"

In particular, for \(\mathcal{S}=\{ \Omega\} \), absence of model-independent arbitrage is equivalent to the existence of a martingale measure; for \(\mathcal{S}\) being the open sets, absence of open arbitrage is equivalent to the existence of full support martingale measures. These results are obtained by adopting a technical filtration enlargement and by constructing a universal aggregator of all arbitrage opportunities. We further introduce the notion of market feasibility and provide its characterization via arbitrage conditions. We conclude providing a dual representation of open arbitrage in terms of weakly open sets of probability measures, which highlights the robust nature of this concept.","Matteo Burzoni1, Marco Frittelli1 & Marco Maggis",Finance and Stochastics,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-015-0283-x,"Model uncertainty,First fundamental theorem of asset pricing,Feasible market,Open arbitrage,Full support martingale measure"

0,A fourth-order compact time-splitting Fourier pseudospectral method for the Dirac equation,"We propose a new fourth-order compact time-splitting (\(S_\mathrm{4c}\)) Fourier pseudospectral method for the Dirac equation by splitting the Dirac equation into two parts together with using the double commutator between them to integrate the Dirac equation at each time interval. The method is explicit, fourth-order in time and spectral order in space. It is unconditionally stable and conserves the total probability in the discretized level. It is called a compact time-splitting method since, at each time step, the number of substeps in \(S_\mathrm{4c}\) is much less than those of the standard fourth-order splitting method and the fourth-order partitioned Runge–Kutta splitting method. Another advantage of \(S_\mathrm{4c}\) is that it avoids to use negative time steps in integrating subproblems at each time interval. Comparison between \(S_\mathrm{4c}\) and many other existing time-splitting methods for the Dirac equation is carried out in terms of accuracy and efficiency as well as longtime behavior. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage in terms of efficiency and accuracy of the proposed \(S_\mathrm{4c}\). Finally, we report the spatial/temporal resolutions of \(S_\mathrm{4c}\) for the Dirac equation in different parameter regimes including the nonrelativistic limit regime, the semiclassical limit regime, and the simultaneously nonrelativistic and massless limit regime.","Weizhu Bao

0,On the unranked topology of maximally probable ranked gene tree topologies,"A ranked tree topology is a tree topology with a temporal ordering of its coalescence events. Under the multispecies coalescent model, we consider ranked gene tree topologies realized along the branches of ranked species trees, where one gene copy is sampled for each species. Previous results have demonstrated that for almost all ranked species tree topologies with at least five species, there exists a set of branch lengths such that the maximally probable ranked gene tree topologies—those generated with the highest probability under the model—do not match the species tree ranked topology. Here, we focus on the agreement of a ranked species tree with its maximally probable ranked gene tree topologies in terms of their unranked topology, that is, disregarding the ordering of the coalescence events. We show that although the set of maximally probable ranked gene tree topologies for a ranked species tree can contain ranked trees with different unranked topologies, at least one of these maximal ranked gene tree topologies must have the same unranked topology as the species tree. Our results contribute to the study of the relationships between gene trees and species trees.

Such systems play an important role in quantum physics in the description of Boson systems at positive temperature 1/β. In this paper, we describe the large-N behaviour of the empirical path measure (the mean of the Dirac measures in the N paths) and of the mean of the normalised occupation measures of the N motions in terms of large deviations principles. The rate functions are given as variational formulas involving certain entropies and Fenchel–Legendre transforms. Consequences are drawn for asymptotic independence statements and laws of large numbers. In the special case related to quantum physics, our rate function for the occupation measures turns out to be equal to the well-known Donsker–Varadhan rate function for the occupation measures of one motion in the limit of diverging time.

We assume viability differences in the population captured by a linear game within each deme as a result of pairwise interactions. Assuming weak selection, conservative migration and the limit case of the structured coalescent assumptions, we derive the first-order approximation for the fixation probability of a single mutant, initially introduced in the continent, with respect to the intensity of selection. This result is applied to the case of the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma, when the resident strategy is always defect and the mutant cooperative strategy is tit-for-tat. In this context, we investigate the condition under which selection favors the emergence of cooperation and we derive an extension of the “one-third law” of evolution. When the continent and the islands are of the same size, we compare the continental island model to its Wright’s island model counterpart. When the islands have the same size, but this size differs from the size of the continent, we investigate how the asymmetry in the deme sizes can better promote the evolution of tit-for-tat compared to its equal deme sizes model counterpart.",Véronique Ladret,Dynamic Games and Applications,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13235-022-00443-1,"Evolutionary game theory,Finite population,Structured coalescent,Fixation probability,One third law"

0,"Sharp Recovery Bounds for Convex Demixing, with Applications","Demixing refers to the challenge of identifying two structured signals given only the sum of the two signals and prior information about their structures. Examples include the problem of separating a signal that is sparse with respect to one basis from a signal that is sparse with respect to a second basis, and the problem of decomposing an observed matrix into a low-rank matrix plus a sparse matrix. This paper describes and analyzes a framework, based on convex optimization, for solving these demixing problems, and many others. This work introduces a randomized signal model that ensures that the two structures are incoherent, i.e., generically oriented. For an observation from this model, this approach identifies a summary statistic that reflects the complexity of a particular signal. The difficulty of separating two structured, incoherent signals depends only on the total complexity of the two structures. Some applications include (1) demixing two signals that are sparse in mutually incoherent bases, (2) decoding spread-spectrum transmissions in the presence of impulsive errors, and (3) removing sparse corruptions from a low-rank matrix. In each case, the theoretical analysis of the convex demixing method closely matches its empirical behavior.",Michael B. McCoy1 & Joel A.

More precisely, a network with a single entry and several exits with uncertain loads is studied. Feasibility of a load constellation is understood in the sense of an existing flow meeting these loads along with given pressure bounds in the pipes. In a first step, feasibility of deterministic exit loads is characterized algebraically and these general conditions are specified to networks involving at most one cycle. This prerequisite is essential for determining probabilities in a stochastic setting when exit loads are assumed to follow some (joint) Gaussian distribution when modeling uncertain customer demand. The key of our approach is the application of the spheric-radial decomposition of Gaussian random vectors coupled with Quasi Monte-Carlo sampling. This approach requires an efficient algorithmic treatment of the mentioned algebraic relations moreover depending on a scalar parameter. Numerical results are illustrated for different network examples and demonstrate a clear superiority in terms of precision over simple generic Monte-Carlo sampling. They lead to fairly accurate probability values even for moderate sample size.","Claudia Gotzes1, Holger Heitsch2, René Henrion2 & …Rüdiger Schultz",Mathematical Methods of Operations Research,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00186-016-0564-y,"Mathematical models for gas pipelines,Nomination validation,Gas network capacity,Uncertainty quantifcation,Optimization under stochastic uncertainty,Spheric-radial decomposition"

This network model is also applied to a market with multi-dimensionally differentiated products. In a non-networked market, it is known that the Bertrand–Nash equilibrium pricing is evolutionarily stable. We show, however, that in our large networked market, the Bertrand–Nash equilibrium price is not stable but a collusive price is evolutionarily stable under weak selection. As the magnitude of transportation cost increases, firms charge a more collusive price in the long run. The results suggest that collusive pricing prevails in a large market if and only if it is networked.","Yasuhiro Shirata

We study this process on the 3-regular tree \({\mathbb {T}}_3\), where it is known that the critical threshold \(p_c\), below which \({\mathbb {P}}_p\)-a.s. all spins fixate to \(-1\), is strictly less than 1/2. Defining \(\theta (p)\) to be the \({\mathbb {P}}_p\)-probability that a vertex fixates to \(+1\), we show that \(\theta \) is a continuous function on [0, 1], so that, in particular, \(\theta (p_c)=0\). To do this, we introduce a new continuous-spin process we call the median process, which gives a coupling of all the measures \({\mathbb {P}}_p\). Along the way, we study the time-infinity agreement clusters of the median process, show that they are a.s. finite, and deduce that all continuous spins flip finitely often. In the second half of the paper, we show a correlation decay statement for the discrete spins under \({\mathbb {P}}_p\) for a.e. value of p. The proof relies on finiteness of a vertex’s “trace” in the median process to derive a stability of discrete spins under finite resampling. Last, we use our methods to answer a question of Howard (J Appl Probab 37:736–747, 2000) on the emergence of spin chains in \({\mathbb {T}}_3\) in finite time.

In this paper, uniform memory architectures with various interconnection networks including crossbar, multiple-buses and generalized shuffle networks are studied. We propose a general method based on the Markov chain model by assuming that the blocked memory requests will be redistributed to the memory modules in the next memory cycle. This assumption results in an analysis with lower complexity where the number of states is linearly proportional to the number of processors. Moreover, it can provide excellent estimation on the system power and memory bandwidth for all three types of interconnection networks as compared with the simulation results in which the blocked memory requests are resubmitted to the same memory module. Comparisons also show that our method is more general and precise than most existing analysis methods. The method is further extended to estimate the performance of multiprocessor system with caches.

By identifying the right equations satisfied by the solutions of the MVSDEs with shifted driving Lévy noise, we build up a framework to fully apply the weak convergence method to establish large and moderate deviation principles for MVSDEs. In the case of ordinary SDEs, the rate function is calculated by using the solutions of the corresponding skeleton equations simply replacing the noise by the elements of the Cameron-Martin space. It turns out that the correct rate function for MVSDEs is defined through the solutions of skeleton equations replacing the noise by smooth functions and replacing the distributions involved in the equation by the distribution of the solution of the corresponding deterministic equation (without the noise). This is somehow surprising. With this approach, we obtain large and moderate deviation principles for much wider classes of MVSDEs in comparison with the existing literature see Dos Reis et al. (Ann.

In this paper, we focus on the binary symmetric SBM—in which a graph of n vertices is randomly generated by first partitioning the vertices into two equal-sized communities and then connecting each pair of vertices with probability that depends on their community memberships—and study the associated exact community recovery problem. Although the maximum-likelihood formulation of the problem is non-convex and discrete, we propose to tackle it using a popular iterative method called projected power iterations. To ensure fast convergence of the method, we initialize it using a point that is generated by another iterative method called orthogonal iterations, which is a classic method for computing invariant subspaces of a symmetric matrix. We show that in the logarithmic sparsity regime of the problem, with high probability the proposed two-stage method can exactly recover the two communities down to the information-theoretic limit in \({\mathcal {O}}(n\log ^2n/\log \log n)\) time, which is competitive with a host of existing state-of-the-art methods that have the same recovery performance.

In this paper we analyse an algorithm for establishing such a common secret key by public discussion, under the modest and practical requirement that Alice and Bob are initially in possession of keys \(A\) and \(B\), respectively, of a common length \(N\) which are not necessarily equal but are such that the mutual information \(I(A,B)\) is non-zero. This assumption is tantamount to assuming only that the corresponding statistical variables are correlated. The common secret key distilled by the algorithm will enjoy perfect secrecy in the sense of Shannon. The method thus provides a profound generalization of traditional symmetric key cryptography and applies also to quantum cryptography. Here, by purely elementary methods, we give a rigorous proof that the method proposed by Bennett, Bessette, Brassard, Salvail, and Smolin will in general converge to a non-empty common key under moderate assumptions on the choice of block lengths provided the initial bit strings are sufficiently long. Full details on the length requirements are presented. Furthermore, we consider the question of which block lengths should be chosen for optimal performance with respect to the length of the resulting common key. A new and fundamental aspect of this paper is the explicit utilization of finite fields and error-correcting codes both for checking equality of the generated keys and, later, for the construction of various hash functions. Traditionally this check has been done by performing a few times a comparison of the parity of a random subset of the bits. Here we give a much more efficient procedure by using the powerful methods of error-correcting codes. More general situations are treated in Section 8.","Aiden A. Bruen1, David L.

0,"Pseudospectral Shattering, the Sign Function, and Diagonalization in Nearly Matrix Multiplication Time","We exhibit a randomized algorithm which, given a square matrix \(A\in \mathbb {C}^{n\times n}\) with \(\Vert A\Vert \le 1\) and \(\delta >0\), computes with high probability an invertible V and diagonal D such that \( \Vert A-VDV^{-1}\Vert \le \delta \) using \(O(T_\mathsf {MM}(n)\log ^2(n/\delta ))\) arithmetic operations, in finite arithmetic with \(O(\log ^4(n/\delta )\log n)\) bits of precision. The computed similarity V additionally satisfies \(\Vert V\Vert \Vert V^{-1}\Vert \le O(n^{2.5}/\delta )\). Here \(T_\mathsf {MM}(n)\) is the number of arithmetic operations required to multiply two \(n\times n\) complex matrices numerically stably, known to satisfy \(T_\mathsf {MM}(n)=O(n^{\omega +\eta })\) for every \(\eta >0\) where \(\omega \) is the exponent of matrix multiplication (Demmel et al. in Numer Math 108(1):59–91, 2007). The algorithm is a variant of the spectral bisection algorithm in numerical linear algebra (Beavers Jr. and Denman in Numer Math 21(1-2):143–169, 1974) with a crucial Gaussian perturbation preprocessing step. Our result significantly improves the previously best-known provable running times of \(O(n^{10}/\delta ^2)\) arithmetic operations for diagonalization of general matrices (Armentano et al. in J Eur Math Soc 20(6):1375–1437, 2018) and (with regard to the dependence on n) \(O(n^3)\) arithmetic operations for Hermitian matrices (Dekker and Traub in Linear Algebra Appl 4:137–154, 1971). It is the first algorithm to achieve nearly matrix multiplication time for diagonalization in any model of computation (real arithmetic, rational arithmetic, or finite arithmetic), thereby matching the complexity of other dense linear algebra operations such as inversion and QR factorization up to polylogarithmic factors. The proof rests on two new ingredients. (1) We show that adding a small complex Gaussian perturbation to any matrix splits its pseudospectrum into n small well-separated components. In particular, this implies that the eigenvalues of the perturbed matrix have a large minimum gap, a property of independent interest in random matrix theory. (2) We give a rigorous analysis of Roberts’ Newton iteration method (Roberts in Int J Control 32(4):677–687, 1980) for computing the sign function of a matrix in finite arithmetic, itself an open problem in numerical analysis since at least 1986.","Jess Banks1, Jorge Garza-Vargas1, Archit Kulkarni1 & …Nikhil Srivastava",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-022-09577-5,"Linear algebra,Random matrix theory,Numerical analysis,Computational complexity"
0,A necessary and sufficient condition for diagnosability of stochastic discrete event systems,"Stochastic discrete event systems (SDES) are systems whose evolution is described by the occurrence of a sequence of events, where each event has a defined probability of occurring from each state. The diagnosability problem for SDES is the problem of determining the conditions under which occurrences of a fault can be detected in finite time with arbitrarily high probability.

A-diagnosability and reported a necessary and sufficient condition for A-diagnosability, but only a sufficient condition for A
A-diagnosability. In this paper, we provide a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for determining whether or not an SDES is A
A-diagnosable. We also show that verification of A
A-diagnosability is equivalent to verification of the termination of the cumulative sum (CUSUM) procedure for hidden Markov models, and that, for a specific class of SDES called fault-immediate systems, the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) minimizes the expected number of observable events required to distinguish between the normal and faulty modes.",David Thorsley1 nAff,Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10626-017-0236-y,"Stochastic discrete event systems,Diagnosability,Hidden Markov models,Change point detection"

The key to our method is linking SAA, distributionally robust optimization, and hypothesis testing of goodness-of-fit. Beyond Robust SAA, this connection provides a unified perspective enabling us to characterize the finite sample and asymptotic guarantees of various other data-driven procedures that are based upon distributionally robust optimization. This analysis provides insight into the practical performance of these various methods in real applications.

We establish compact differentiability of this operator tangentially to continuous functions and introduce a family of norms such that it is Fréchet differentiable with respect to them.

0,Size of subsets of groups and Haar null sets,"This is a study of several notions of size of subsets of groups. The first part (sections 3–5) concerns a purely algebraic setting with the underlying group discrete. The various notions of size considered there are similar to each other in that each of them assesses the size of a set using a family of measures and translations of the set; they differ in the type of measures used and the type of translations allowed. The way these various notions relate to each other is tightly and, perhaps, unexpectedly connected with the algebraic structure of the group. An important role is played by amenable, ICC (infinite conjugacy class), and FC (finite conjugacy class) groups.The second part of the paper (section 6), which was the original motivation for the present work, deals with a well-studied notion of smallness of subsets of Polish, not necessarily locally compact, groups – Haar null sets. It contains applications of the results from the first part in solving some problems posed by Christensen and by Mycielski.

For example, for randomly generated F with n = 64 variables and a training set of m = 16384 examples, the error on the same number of test examples was about 19% on positive and 29% on negative examples, respectively.

We investigate the origin of the regularity and synchrony which have been observed in numerical experiments of two realistic models of molecular motors, namely Fisher–Kolomeisky’s model of myosin V for vesicle transport in cells and Duke’s model of myosin II for sarcomere shortening in muscle contraction. We show that there is a generic organizing principle behind the emergence of regular gait for a motor pulling a large cargo and synchrony of action of many motors pulling a single cargo. These results are surprising in that the models used are inherently stochastic, and yet they display regular behaviors in the parameter range relevant to experiments. Our results also show that these behaviors are not tied to the particular models used in these experiments, but rather are generic to a wide class of motor protein models.

0,On branching heuristics for the bi-objective 0/1 unidimensional knapsack problem,"This paper focuses on branching strategies that are involved in branch and bound algorithms when solving multi-objective optimization problems. The choice of the branching variable at each node of the search tree constitutes indeed an important component of these algorithms. In this work we focus on multi-objective knapsack problems. In the literature, branching heuristics used for these problems are static, i.e., the order on the variables is determined prior to the execution. This study investigates the benefit of defining more sophisticated branching strategies. We first analyze and compare a representative set of classic branching heuristics and conclude that none can be identified as the best overall heuristic. Using an oracle, we highlight that combining branching heuristics within the same branch and bound algorithm leads to considerably reduced search trees but induces high computational costs. Based on learning adaptive techniques, we propose then dynamic adaptive branching strategies that are able to select the suitable heuristic to apply at each node of the search tree.

0,Iterant recombination with one-norm minimization for multilevel Markov chain algorithms via the ellipsoid method,"Recently, it was shown how the convergence of a class of multigrid methods for computing the stationary distribution of sparse, irreducible Markov chains can be accelerated by the addition of an outer iteration based on iterant recombination. The acceleration was performed by selecting a linear combination of previous fine-level iterates with probability constraints to minimize the two-norm of the residual using a quadratic programming method. In this paper we investigate the alternative of minimizing the one-norm of the residual. This gives rise to a nonlinear convex program which must be solved at each acceleration step. To solve this minimization problem we propose to use a deep-cuts ellipsoid method for nonlinear convex programs. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate whether an iterant recombination approach can be obtained in this way that is competitive in terms of execution time and robustness. We derive formulas for subgradients of the one-norm objective function and the constraint functions, and show how an initial ellipsoid can be constructed that is guaranteed to contain the exact solution and give conditions for its existence. We also investigate using the ellipsoid method to minimize the two-norm. Numerical tests show that the one-norm and two-norm acceleration procedures yield a similar reduction in the number of multigrid cycles. The tests also indicate that one-norm ellipsoid acceleration is competitive with two-norm quadratic programming acceleration in terms of running time with improved robustness.","Hans De Sterck1, Killian Miller1 & Geoffrey Sanders",Computing and Visualization in Science,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00791-011-0163-7,"Markov chain,Iterant recombination,Ellipsoid algorithm,Multigrid,Convex programming"
0,Covering models and optimization techniques for emergency response facility location and planning: a review,"With emergencies being, unfortunately, part of our lives, it is crucial to efficiently plan and allocate emergency response facilities that deliver effective and timely relief to people most in need. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) allocation problems deal with locating EMS facilities among potential sites to provide efficient and effective services over a wide area with spatially distributed demands. It is often problematic due to the intrinsic complexity of these problems. This paper reviews covering models and optimization techniques for emergency response facility location and planning in the literature from the past few decades, while emphasizing recent developments. We introduce several typical covering models and their extensions ordered from simple to complex, including Location Set Covering Problem (LSCP), Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP), Double Standard Model (DSM), Maximum Expected Covering Location Problem (MEXCLP), and Maximum Availability Location Problem (MALP) models. In addition, recent developments on hypercube queuing models, dynamic allocation models, gradual covering models, and cooperative covering models are also presented in this paper. The corresponding optimization techniques to solve these models, including heuristic algorithms, simulation, and exact methods, are summarized.","Xueping Li1, Zhaoxia Zhao1, Xiaoyan Zhu1 & …Tami Wyatt",Mathematical Methods of Operations Research,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00186-011-0363-4,"Emergency facility location,Modeling and optimization,Mathematical modeling,Covering model,Genetic algorithm,Tabu search,Simulation"

In such contexts, interests are often in the fractal nature of the sample surfaces and in the rate of change of the spatial surface at a given location in a given direction.

0,"A one-round, two-prover, zero-knowledge protocol for NP","The model of zero-knowledge multi-prover interactive proofs was introduced by Ben-Or, Goldwasser, Kilian and Wigderson in [4]. A major open problem associated with this model is whether NP problems can be proven by one-round, two-prover, zero-knowledge protocols with exponentially small error probability (e.g. via parallel executions). A positive answer was claimed by Fortnow, Rompel and Sipser in [12], but its proof was later shown to be flawed by Fortnow who demonstrated that the probability of cheating inn independent parallel rounds can be much higher than the probability of cheating inn independent sequential rounds (with exponential ratio between them). In this paper we solve this problem: We show a new one-round two-prover interactive proof for Graph Hamiltonicity, we prove that it is complete, sound and perfect zeroknowledge, and thus every problem in NP has a one-round two-prover interactive proof which is perfectly zero knowledge under no cryptographic assumptions. The main difficulty is in proving the soundness of our parallel protocol namely, proving that the probability of cheating in this one-round protocol is upper bounded by some exponentially low threshold. We prove that this probability is at most 1/2n/9 (wheren is the number of parallel rounds), by translating the soundness problem into some extremal combinatorial problem, and then solving this new problem.",Dror Lapidot1 & Adi Shamir,Combinatorica,1995,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01200756,"94 A 60,05 C 35"
0,Diffusion approximation of the stochastic process of microtubule assembly,"Microtubules are protein polymers that guide intracellular motility. Stochastic switching of a microtubule between states of elongation, shortening, and pause is described in detail by the dynamic instability (DI) model. Recently we have described the dynamics of microtubules phenomenologically as generalized diffusion of their ends. Genesis of the diffusion dynamics and accuracy of diffusion model are studied in this work. It is shown that wandering of the end of a microtubule undergoing DI asymptotically approaches the Wiener diffusion process. Accuracy of the diffusion approximation is evaluated by comparing its predictions with results of simulation of DI. Stationary distributions of microtubule length and lifetime that are predicted by both models differ qualitatively between two cell types considered. However, predictions of the diffusion model are in each case practically identical to predictions of the DI model being also consistent with experimental data. The peculiar stochastic process of microtubule assembly thus converges at cell scale to a kind of widespread-in-nature diffusion process. This result is considered an example of qualitative change in dynamical properties in transition from the molecular to cellular level of biological organization. Additionally, it suggests employment of diffusion process theory in studying functions of microtubules in the cell.",Ivan V.

0,Algorithms to find exact inclusion probabilities for 2Pπps sampling designs,"The statistical literature contains several proposals for methods generating fixed-size without-replacement πps sampling designs. πps designs with fixed size have rarely been used due to difficulties with implementation. Recently, a new method was proposed viz. the 2Pπps design using a two-phase approach. It was shown that the first-order inclusion probabilities of the 2Pπps design are asymptotically equal to the target inclusion probabilities of a πps design.This paper extends the work on the 2Pπps design and presents algorithms for calculation of exact first- and secondorder inclusion probabilities. Starting from a probability mass function (pmf) of the sum of N independent, but not equally distributed Bernoulli variables, the algorithms are based on derived expressions for the pmfs of sums of N − 1 and N − 2 variables, respectively.Exact inclusion probabilities facilitate standard-based inference and provide a tool for studying the properties of the 2Pπps design. Furthermore, empirical results presented show that the properties of the suggested point estimator can be improved using a more general 2Pπps design. In addition, the frequently used Conditional Poisson sampling design is shown to be a special case of this more general 2Pπps design.","Jens Olofsson1,",Lithuanian Mathematical Journal,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10986-011-9137-1,"62D05,62F10,60C05"

The service time distribution follows any general distribution and allowed to change only at service initiation instant, depending on queue length and serving batch size. A single server is providing service following general bulk service rule. We employed the supplementary variable technique and the embedded Markov chain technique to compute the joint probabilities of queue length and serving batch size at various epoch, viz., arbitrary epoch, departure epoch and pre-arrival epoch, in steady state.

0,On time-triggered and event-based control of integrator systems over a shared communication system,"When analyzing networked control systems, where the control loop is closed over a communication system, it is crucial to take the communication system into account. Hence, time-triggered and event-based control of an integrator system with noise over a shared communication system is analyzed. Thereby, analytical models of different communication systems are used and the analysis is focused on the effect of the communication system on the performance, as well as the interaction between control and communication. For time-triggered control, where the event times are known in advance, a deterministic communication protocol can be used. Hence, time-triggered control with the two most well-known deterministic communication protocols, time division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA), is analyzed. For event-based control, where the events appear at random times, a contention-based communication protocol should be used. Hence, event-based control is analyzed with different contention-based communication protocols: pure ALOHA, slotted ALOHA, a queueing system, and Erlang’s loss model. It turns out that time-triggered control with either TDMA or FDMA outperforms event-based control with pure or slotted ALOHA. However, event-based control with a properly designed queueing system gives an even better performance. Thus, we conclude that it is crucial to take the details of the communication system into account.",Rainer Blind1 & Frank Allgöwer,"Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems",2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00498-013-0117-3,"Networked control system,Communication system,Time-triggered control,Event-based control"
0,Hall’s Conjecture on Extremal Sets for Random Triangles,"In this paper, we partially resolve Hall’s conjecture (Hall in J Appl Probab 19(3):712–715, 1982) on random triangles. We consider the probability that three points chosen uniformly at random from a bounded convex region of the plane form an acute triangle. Hall’s conjecture states that this probability is maximized by the disk. This can be interpreted as a probabilistic version of the isoperimetric inequality. We first prove that the disk is a weak local maximum among bounded domains in \({\mathbb {R}}^2\) and that the ball is a weak local maximum in \({\mathbb {R}}^3\). In \({\mathbb {R}}^2\), we then prove a local \(C^{2,\frac{1}{2}}\)-type estimate on the probability in the Hausdorff topology. This enables us to prove that the disk is a strong local maximum in the Gromov–Hausdorff topology (modulo congruences). Finally, we give an explicit upper bound on the isoperimetric ratio for a region which maximizes the probability and show how this reduces verifying the full conjecture to a finite, though currently intractable, calculation.","Gabriel Khan

0,Economic oriented stochastic optimization in process control using Taguchi’s method,"The optimal operating region of complex production systems is situated close to process constraints related to quality or safety requirements. Higher profit can be realized only by assuring a relatively low frequency of violation of these constraints. We defined a Taguchi-type loss function to aggregate these constraints, target values, and desired ranges of product quality. We evaluate this loss function by Monte-Carlo simulation to handle the stochastic nature of the process and apply the gradient-free Mesh Adaptive Direct Search algorithm to optimize the resulted robust cost function. This optimization scheme is applied to determine the optimal set-point values of control loops with respect to pre-determined risk levels, uncertainties and costs of violation of process constraints. The concept is illustrated by a well-known benchmark problem related to the control of a linear dynamical system and the model predictive control of a more complex nonlinear polymerization process. The application examples illustrate that the loss function of Taguchi is an ideal tool to represent performance requirements of control loops and the proposed Monte-Carlo simulation based optimization scheme is effective to find the optimal operating regions of controlled processes.","András Király1, László Dobos1 & János Abonyi",Optimization and Engineering,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-013-9237-3,"Monte-Carlo simulation,Model predictive control,Economic assessment,Stochastic optimization"

0,Infinite-body optimal transport with Coulomb cost,"We introduce and analyze symmetric infinite-body optimal transport (OT) problems with cost function of pair potential form. We show that for a natural class of such costs, the optimizer is given by the independent product measure all of whose factors are given by the one-body marginal. This is in striking contrast to standard finite-body OT problems, in which the optimizers are typically highly correlated, as well as to infinite-body OT problems with Gangbo–Swiech cost. Moreover, by adapting a construction from the study of exchangeable processes in probability theory, we prove that the corresponding \(N\)-body OT problem is well approximated by the infinite-body problem. To our class belongs the Coulomb cost which arises in many-electron quantum mechanics. The optimal cost of the Coulombic N-body OT problem as a function of the one-body marginal density is known in the physics and quantum chemistry literature under the name SCE functional, and arises naturally as the semiclassical limit of the celebrated Hohenberg-Kohn functional. Our results imply that in the inhomogeneous high-density limit (i.e. \(N\rightarrow \infty \) with arbitrary fixed inhomogeneity profile \(\rho {/}N\)), the SCE functional converges to the mean field functional.

0,Discovering a junction tree behind a Markov network by a greedy algorithm,"In our paper (Annals of Operations Research, 193:71–90, 2012) we introduced a special kind of k−1-width junction tree, called k-th order cherry tree in order to approximate a joint probability distribution. The approximation is the best if the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the true joint probability distribution and the approximating one is minimal. Finding the best approximating k−1-width junction tree probability distribution is NP-complete if 2<k<d−1, where d is the dimension of the joint probability distribution (see Karger and Srebro in 12th ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), 2001, Malvestuto in Kybernetika 48:825–844, 2012). In Broad Research in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience (BRAIN), special issue on complexity in sciences and artificial intelligence, pp. 40–45, 2010 we also proved that the best approximating k−1-width junction tree probability distribution can be embedded into a k-th order cherry tree probability distribution.We introduce here a greedy algorithm resulting very good approximations in reasonable computing time. We prove then that if the Markov network which encodes the conditional independences of the multivariate probability distribution fulfills some requirements then our greedy algorithm is able to find the true probability distribution. Our algorithm uses just the k-th order marginal probability distributions as input.We compare the results of the greedy algorithm proposed in this paper with the greedy algorithm proposed by Malvestuto (IEEE Trans.

0,Linking demyelination to compound action potential dispersion with a spike-diffuse-spike approach,"To establish and exploit novel biomarkers of demyelinating diseases requires a mechanistic understanding of axonal propagation. Here, we present a novel computational framework called the stochastic spike-diffuse-spike (SSDS) model for assessing the effects of demyelination on axonal transmission. It models transmission through nodal and internodal compartments with two types of operations: a stochastic integrate-and-fire operation captures nodal excitability and a linear filtering operation describes internodal propagation. The effects of demyelinated segments on the probability of transmission, transmission delay and spike time jitter are explored. We argue that demyelination-induced impedance mismatch prevents propagation mostly when the action potential leaves a demyelinated region, not when it enters a demyelinated region. In addition, we model sodium channel remodeling as a homeostatic control of nodal excitability. We find that the effects of mild demyelination on transmission probability and delay can be largely counterbalanced by an increase in excitability at the nodes surrounding the demyelination. The spike timing jitter, however, reflects the level of demyelination whether excitability is fixed or is allowed to change in compensation. This jitter can accumulate over long axons and leads to a broadening of the compound action potential, linking microscopic defects to a mesoscopic observable. Our findings articulate why action potential jitter and compound action potential dispersion can serve as potential markers of weak and sporadic demyelination.","Richard Naud

0,An analysis of the velocity updating rule of the particle swarm optimization algorithm,"The particle swarm optimization algorithm includes three vectors associated with each particle: inertia, personal, and social influence vectors. The personal and social influence vectors are typically multiplied by random diagonal matrices (often referred to as random vectors) resulting in changes in their lengths and directions. This multiplication, in turn, influences the variation of the particles in the swarm. In this paper we examine several issues associated with the multiplication of personal and social influence vectors by such random matrices, these include: (1) Uncontrollable changes in the length and direction of these vectors resulting in delay in convergence or attraction to locations far from quality solutions in some situations (2) Weak direction alternation for the vectors that are aligned closely to coordinate axes resulting in preventing the swarm from further improvement in some situations, and (3) limitation in particle movement to one orthant resulting in premature convergence in some situations. To overcome these issues, we use randomly generated rotation matrices (rather than the random diagonal matrices) in the velocity updating rule of the particle swarm optimizer. This approach makes it possible to control the impact of the random components (i.e. the random matrices) on the direction and length of personal and social influence vectors separately. As a result, all the above mentioned issues are effectively addressed. We propose to use the Euclidean rotation matrices for rotation because it preserves the length of the vectors during rotation, which makes it easier to control the effects of the randomness on the direction and length of vectors. The direction of the Euclidean matrices is generated randomly by a normal distribution. The mean and variance of the distribution are investigated in detail for different algorithms and different numbers of dimensions. Also, an adaptive approach for the variance of the normal distribution is proposed which is independent from the algorithm and the number of dimensions. The method is adjoined to several particle swarm optimization variants. It is tested on 18 standard optimization benchmark functions in 10, 30 and 60 dimensional spaces. Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of several types of particle swarm optimization algorithms in terms of convergence speed and solution quality.","Mohammad Reza Bonyadi1, Zbigniew Michalewicz1,2,3 & Xiaodong Li",Journal of Heuristics,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10732-014-9245-2,"Continuous optimization,Swarm intelligence,Particle swarm optimization,Rotation matrices"
0,A Multi-Component General Discrete System Subject to Different Types of Failures with Loss of Units,"Discrete systems are used in several fields such as reliability and computing and electronics in digital systems. On the other hand, there are systems that cannot be continuously monitored and they can be observed only at certain periods of time, via inspections, for example. In this paper a repairable multi-component system subject to internal and accidental external failures with loss of units is developed. The system is composed of a finite number of units, including the main one and the others disposed in cold standby. If a repairable failure occurs, the main unit enters the repair channel. On the other hand, the unit is removed if the failure is non-repairable. A repairman is considered. The distribution of the lifetime of the main unit is a general one and its phase-type representation is considered. Accidental failures occur according to a general discrete renewal process. The model is developed in detail and the up period is worked out up to no units and up to total failure of the system. Some reliability measures of interest such as the conditional probability of different types of failures are calculated. The operating of the system is analysed according to rewards introduced in the model. We have built complex algorithms for calculating the measures defined in this paper. We have introduced the RG-factorization method to work out these measures by means of matrices with low order. The results have been implemented computationally with Matlab.

 for large q. We decompose such a representation as a sum of irreducible components (or, alternatively, Young diagrams) and we ask what is the character of a randomly chosen component (or, what is the shape of a randomly chosen Young diagram). Our main result is that for a large class of representations the fluctuations of characters (and fluctuations of the shape of the Young diagrams) are asymptotically Gaussian; in this way we generalize Kerov's central limit theorem. The considered class consists of representations for which the characters almost factorize and this class includes, for example, the left-regular representation (Plancherel measure), irreducible representations and tensor representations. This class is also closed under induction, restriction, outer product and tensor product of representations. Our main tool in the proof is the method of genus expansion, well known from the random matrix theory.",Piotr Śniady,Probability Theory and Related Fields,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-005-0483-y,"Conjugacy Class,Symmetric Group,Young Diagram,Random Matrix Theory,Disjoint Cycle"

n-Person Dynamic Strategic Market Games","We present a discrete n-person model of a dynamic strategic market game. We show that for some values of the discount factor the game possesses a stationary equilibrium where all the players make high bids. Within the class of all the high-bidding strategies we distinguish between two classes of more and less aggressive ones. We show that the set of discount factors for which these more aggressive strategies form equilibria shrinks as n goes to infinity. On the other hand, the analogous set for the less aggressive strategies grows to the whole interval (0,1) as n grows to infinity. Further we analyze the properties of the value function corresponding to these high-bidding equilibria.

Encounters by an individual predator (larva) with prey patches, and with individual prey within patches, are represented by Poisson processes. It is demonstrated analytically, and confirmed by numerical experiments, that prey patchiness fails to alter mean predator-prey encounter rates from their values for homogeneous prey distributions. Individual variance in encounter rate is, however, much affected. This has significant consequences for the (small) numbers of larvae surviving to metamorphosis and recruitment to the adult fish population.",Jonathan William Pitchford1 & John Brindley,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1006/bulm.2001.0230,"Prey Density,Larval Growth,Encounter Rate,Individual Prey,Prey Organism"

We provide insights into the near-critical regime by considering the stochastic SIS logistic epidemic, a well-known birth-and-death chain used to model the spread of an epidemic within a population of a given size N. We study the behaviour of the process as the population size N tends to infinity. Our results cover the entire subcritical regime, including the “barely subcritical” regime, where the recovery rate exceeds the infection rate by an amount that tends to 0 as \(N \rightarrow \infty \) but more slowly than \(N^{-1/2}\). We derive precise asymptotics for the distribution of the extinction time and the total number of cases throughout the subcritical regime, give a detailed description of the course of the epidemic, and compare to numerical results for a range of parameter values. We hypothesise that features of the course of the epidemic will be seen in a wide class of other epidemic models, and we use real data to provide some tentative and preliminary support for this theory.","Graham Brightwell1, Thomas House

As a main step for an algorithmic solution of such problems, we prove a derivative formula for (normal) probabilities of rectangles as functions of their lower or upper bounds. This formula allows to reduce the calculus of such derivatives to the calculus of (normal) probabilities of rectangles themselves thus generalizing a similar well-known statement for multivariate normal distribution functions. As an application, we consider a problem from water reservoir management. One of the outcomes of the problem solution is that the (still frequently encountered) use of simple individual probabilistic constraints can completely fail. By contrast, the (more difficult) use of joint probabilistic constraints, which heavily depends on the derivative formula mentioned before, yields very reasonable and robust solutions over the whole time horizon considered.","Wim Van Ackooij1, René Henrion2, Andris Möller2 & …Riadh Zorgati",Mathematical Methods of Operations Research,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00186-010-0316-3,"Stochastic programming,Probabilistic constraints,Chance constraints,Derivative of probabilities of rectangles,Water reservoir management"

Of particular interest is the shape of upper tails of the probability distributions of such durations. Recent research suggests that the underlying probability distributions of such durations have heavy tails of hyperbolic type, across a wide range of spatial scales from 2 km to 120 km. These findings are based on radar measurements of spatially averaged rain rate (SARR) over a tropical oceanic region.

0,Expansion or extinction: deterministic and stochastic two-patch models with Allee effects,"We investigate the impact of Allee effect and dispersal on the long-term evolution of a population in a patchy environment. Our main focus is on whether a population already established in one patch either successfully invades an adjacent empty patch or undergoes a global extinction. Our study is based on the combination of analytical and numerical results for both a deterministic two-patch model and a stochastic counterpart. The deterministic model has either two, three or four attractors. The existence of a regime with exactly three attractors only appears when patches have distinct Allee thresholds. In the presence of weak dispersal, the analysis of the deterministic model shows that a high-density and a low-density populations can coexist at equilibrium in nearby patches, whereas the analysis of the stochastic model indicates that this equilibrium is metastable, thus leading after a large random time to either a global expansion or a global extinction. Up to some critical dispersal, increasing the intensity of the interactions leads to an increase of both the basin of attraction of the global extinction and the basin of attraction of the global expansion. Above this threshold, for both the deterministic and the stochastic models, the patches tend to synchronize as the intensity of the dispersal increases. This results in either a global expansion or a global extinction. For the deterministic model, there are only two attractors, while the stochastic model no longer exhibits a metastable behavior. In the presence of strong dispersal, the limiting behavior is entirely determined by the value of the Allee thresholds as the global population size in the deterministic and the stochastic models evolves as dictated by their single-patch counterparts. For all values of the dispersal parameter, Allee effects promote global extinction in terms of an expansion of the basin of attraction of the extinction equilibrium for the deterministic model and an increase of the probability of extinction for the stochastic model.",Yun Kang1 & Nicolas Lanchier,Journal of Mathematical Biology,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-010-0359-3,"Allee effect,Deterministic model,Stochastic model,Extinction,Expansion,Invasion,Bistability,Basin of attraction,Metastability"

Infinite sequences are put into the channel, transmitted and received as output sequences. Since the channel has memory and noise, the output sequences are not necessarily the same to the input sequences. Output sequences are ambiguous.In this paper for the first time we discuss relationships between an ergodic channel capacity and the Hausdorff dimension of the set of all the output sequences for a noisy channel with finite memory and show that the former is less than or equal to the latter. For each output sequence the ambiguity set is defined to be the set of all the input sequences transmitted to the output sequence. The ambiguity is defined to be a quantity characterizing the complexity of an ambiguity set. Hausdorff dimension is also another quantity characterizing the complexity of the ambiguity set. In this paper we also consider relationships between an ambiguity and Hausdorff dimension of an ambiguity set for a noiseless channel with memory 2, and show that the Hausdorff dimension equals to the ambiguity.","Tatsuya Suzuki1, Fumio Ohi2 & Masasi Kowada",Japan Journal of Industrial and Applied Mathematics,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03167484,"noisy and noiseless channel,essentially noisy channel,channel capacity,ambiguity set,ambiguity"

0,Noisy gradient flow from a random walk in Hilbert space,"Consider a probability measure on a Hilbert space defined via its density with respect to a Gaussian. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that an appropriately defined Markov chain, which is reversible with respect to the measure in question, exhibits a diffusion limit to a noisy gradient flow, also reversible with respect to the same measure. The Markov chain is defined by applying a Metropolis–Hastings accept–reject mechanism (Tierney, Ann Appl Probab 8:1–9, 1998) to an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) proposal which is itself reversible with respect to the underlying Gaussian measure. The resulting noisy gradient flow is a stochastic partial differential equation driven by a Wiener process with spatial correlation given by the underlying Gaussian structure. There are two primary motivations for this work. The first concerns insight into Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods for sampling of measures on a Hilbert space defined via a density with respect to a Gaussian measure. These measures must be approximated on finite dimensional spaces of dimension \(N\) in order to be sampled. A conclusion of the work herein is that MCMC methods based on prior-reversible OU proposals will explore the target measure in \({\mathcal O}(1)\) steps with respect to dimension \(N\). This is to be contrasted with standard MCMC methods based on the random walk or Langevin proposals which require \({\mathcal O}(N)\) and \({\mathcal O}(N^{1/3})\) steps respectively (Mattingly et al., Ann Appl Prob 2011; Pillai et al., Ann Appl Prob 22:2320–2356 2012). The second motivation relates to optimization. There are many applications where it is of interest to find global or local minima of a functional defined on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. Gradient flow or steepest descent is a natural approach to this problem, but in its basic form requires computation of a gradient which, in some applications, may be an expensive or complex task. This paper shows that a stochastic gradient descent described by a stochastic partial differential equation can emerge from certain carefully specified Markov chains. This idea is well-known in the finite state (Kirkpatricket al., Science 220:671–680, 1983; Cerny, J Optim Theory Appl 45:41–51, 1985) or finite dimensional context (German, IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens 1:269–276, 1985; German, SIAM J Control Optim 24:1031, 1986; Chiang, SIAM J Control Optim 25:737–753, 1987; J Funct Anal 83:333–347, 1989). The novelty of the work in this paper is that the emergence of the noisy gradient flow is developed on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. In the context of global optimization, when the noise level is also adjusted as part of the algorithm, methods of the type studied here go by the name of simulated–annealing; see the review (Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis, Stat Sci 8:10–15, 1993) for further references. Although we do not consider adjusting the noise-level as part of the algorithm, the noise strength is a tuneable parameter in our construction and the methods developed here could potentially be used to study simulated annealing in a Hilbert space setting. The transferable idea behind this work is that conceiving of algorithms directly in the infinite dimensional setting leads to methods which are robust to finite dimensional approximation. We emphasize that discretizing, and then applying standard finite dimensional techniques in \(\mathbb {R}^N\), to either sample or optimize, can lead to algorithms which degenerate as the dimension \(N\) increases.","Natesh S.

0,Convergence in Riesz spaces with conditional expectation operators,"A conditional expectation, \(T\), on a Dedekind complete Riesz space with weak order unit is a positive order continuous projection which maps weak order units to weak order units and has \(R(T)\) a Dedekind complete Riesz subspace of \(E\). The concepts of strong convergence and convergence in probability are extended to this setting as \(T\)-strongly convergence and convergence in \(T\)-conditional probability. Critical to the relating of these types of convergence are the concepts of uniform integrability and norm boundedness, generalized as \(T\)-uniformity and \(T\)-boundedness. Here we show that if a net is \(T\)-uniform and convergent in \(T\)-conditional probability then it is \(T\)-strongly convergent, and if a net is \(T\)-strongly convergent then it is convergent in \(T\)-conditional probability. For sequences we have the equivalence that a sequence is \(T\)-uniform and convergent in \(T\)-conditional probability if and only if it is \(T\)-strongly convergent. These results are applied to Riesz space martingales and are applicable to stochastic processes having random variables with ill-defined or infinite expectation.","Youssef Azouzi1, Wen-Chi Kuo2, Kawtar Ramdane1 & …Bruce A.

Both involve finding systems of linear equations satisfied by the desired probabilities. The first approach, which is due to Golding, is to include additional probabilities in the system that allow some members of the sample to be specified at only one locus. The second approach, which is new, considers the joint distribution of the sample configuration and the number of recombination events since the time of the most recent common ancestor. The first approach is used for numerical computation, whereas the second approach is used to derive a two-locus version of Hoppe's urn model.

0,Fuzzy optimality based decision making under imperfect information without utility," In the realm of decision making under uncertainty, the general approach is the use of the utility theories. The main disadvantage of this approach is that it is based on an evaluation of a vector-valued alternative by means of a scalar-valued quantity. This transformation is counterintuitive and leads to loss of information. The latter is related to restrictive assumptions on preferences underlying utility models like independence, completeness, transitivity etc. Relaxation of these assumptions results into more adequate but less tractable models. In contrast, humans conduct direct comparison of alternatives as vectors of attributes’ values and don’t use artificial scalar values. Although vector-valued utility function-based methods exist, a fundamental axiomatic theory is absent and the problem of a direct comparison of vectors remains a challenge with a wide scope of research and applications. In the realm of multicriteria decision making there exist approaches like TOPSIS and AHP to various extent utilizing components-wise comparison of vectors. Basic principle of such comparison is the Pareto optimality which is based on a counterintuitive assumption that all alternatives within a Pareto optimal set are considered equally optimal. The above mentioned mandates necessity to develop new decision approaches based on direct comparison of vector-valued alternatives. In this paper we suggest a fuzzy Pareto optimality (FPO) based approach to decision making with fuzzy probabilities representing linguistic decision-relevant information. We use FPO concept to differentiate “more optimal” solutions from “less optimal” solutions. This is intuitive, especially when dealing with imperfect information. An example is solved to show the validity of the suggested ideas.","Rafik A. Aliev1, Witold Pedrycz2,3, Akif V. Alizadeh4 & …Oleg H.

0,The likelihood ratio test in high-dimensional logistic regression is asymptotically a rescaled Chi-square,"Logistic regression is used thousands of times a day to fit data, predict future outcomes, and assess the statistical significance of explanatory variables. When used for the purpose of statistical inference, logistic models produce p-values for the regression coefficients by using an approximation to the distribution of the likelihood-ratio test (LRT). Indeed, Wilks’ theorem asserts that whenever we have a fixed number p of variables, twice the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) \(2 \Lambda \) is distributed as a \(\chi ^2_k\) variable in the limit of large sample sizes n; here, \(\chi ^2_k\) is a Chi-square with k degrees of freedom and k the number of variables being tested. In this paper, we prove that when p is not negligible compared to n, Wilks’ theorem does not hold and that the Chi-square approximation is grossly incorrect; in fact, this approximation produces p-values that are far too small (under the null hypothesis). Assume that n and p grow large in such a way that \(p/n \rightarrow \kappa \) for some constant \(\kappa < 1/2\). (For \(\kappa > 1/2\), \(2\Lambda {\mathop {\rightarrow }\limits ^{{\mathbb {P}}}}0\) so that the LRT is not interesting in this regime.) We prove that for a class of logistic models, the LLR converges to a rescaled Chi-square, namely, \(2\Lambda ~{\mathop {\rightarrow }\limits ^{\mathrm {d}}}~ \alpha (\kappa ) \chi _k^2\), where the scaling factor \(\alpha (\kappa )\) is greater than one as soon as the dimensionality ratio \(\kappa \) is positive. Hence, the LLR is larger than classically assumed. For instance, when \(\kappa = 0.3\), \(\alpha (\kappa ) \approx 1.5\). In general, we show how to compute the scaling factor by solving a nonlinear system of two equations with two unknowns. Our mathematical arguments are involved and use techniques from approximate message passing theory, from non-asymptotic random matrix theory and from convex geometry. We also complement our mathematical study by showing that the new limiting distribution is accurate for finite sample sizes. Finally, all the results from this paper extend to some other regression models such as the probit regression model.","Pragya Sur1, Yuxin Chen2 & Emmanuel J.

0,Quantifying the parameter dependent basin of the unsafe regime of asymmetric Lévy-noise-induced critical transitions,"In real systems, the unpredictable jump changes of the random environment can induce the critical transitions (CTs) between two non-adjacent states, which are more catastrophic. Taking an asymmetric Lévy-noise-induced tri-stable model with desirable, sub-desirable, and undesirable states as a prototype class of real systems, a prediction of the noise-induced CTs from the desirable state directly to the undesirable one is carried out. We first calculate the region that the current state of the given model is absorbed into the undesirable state based on the escape probability, which is named as the absorbed region. Then, a new concept of the parameter dependent basin of the unsafe regime (PDBUR) under the asymmetric Lévy noise is introduced. It is an efficient tool for approximately quantifying the ranges of the parameters, where the noise-induced CTs from the desirable state directly to the undesirable one may occur. More importantly, it may provide theoretical guidance for us to adopt some measures to avert a noise-induced catastrophic CT.","Jinzhong Ma1, Yong Xu2,3, Yongge Li2, Ruilan Tian4, Shaojuan Ma5 & …J.

Here two kinds of Riemannian optimization algorithms, namely, Riemannian gradient descent algorithm (RGrad) and Riemannian conjugate gradient descent algorithm (RCG), are presented to solve such problem from these special but widely used measurements in practical applications. Since the masked Fourier measurements are less random, we establish stable guarantees for signals by the truncated variants of RGrad and RCG, respectively. First of all, a good initialization is constructed by means of a truncated spectral method. Then we prove that a signal \( {x}\in \mathbb {C}^{n}\) can be recovered robustly to bounded noise through these two algorithms, provided that \(L= O(\log n)\) complex random masks are performed in the measurement process. This implies that the sample complexity is optimal up to a log factor, namely, \(O(n\log n)\). Particularly, each sequence generated by the truncated RGrad and RCG provably converges to the true solution at a geometric rate in the noiseless case. Finally, several empirical experiments are provided to show the effectiveness and stability of such two kinds of algorithms compared with Wirtinger Flow(WF) algorithm, for which provable guarantee has been set up for signals under masked Fourier measurements, provided that \(L= O(\log ^{4}n)\).","Huiping Li1,2 & Song Li",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-021-09914-2,"Phase retrieval,Riemannian optimization,Gradient descent algorithm,Conjugate gradient descent algorithm,Masked Fourier measurements"

I developed the framework by deriving analytical formulas for the numbers of the topologies of the genealogies with two mutation events. This approach gives an advantage to analyze polymorphisms in large samples of DNA sequences at a non-recombining locus under vicarious evolutionary scenarios. Particularly the framework allows to estimate the probability of polymorphism data created by two mutation events as well as the ages of the events. Based on these results I extended the definition of the site frequency spectrum by classifying pairs of polymorphic sites into groups and presented analytical expressions for computing the expected sizes of these groups. Within the framework I also designed a Bayesian approach for inferring the haplotype of the most recent common ancestor at two polymorphic sites. Lastly, the framework was applied to polymorphism data from human APOE gene region under various demographic scenarios for ancestral human population and explored the signature of linkage disequilibrium for inferring the ancestral haplotype at two polymorphic sites.

0,Non-stationary phase of the MALA algorithm,"The Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method which creates a Markov chain reversible with respect to a given target distribution, \(\pi ^N\), with Lebesgue density on \({\mathbb {R}}^N\); it can hence be used to approximately sample the target distribution. When the dimension N is large a key question is to determine the computational cost of the algorithm as a function of N. The measure of efficiency that we consider in this paper is the expected squared jumping distance (ESJD), introduced in Roberts et al. (Ann Appl Probab 7(1):110–120, 1997). To determine how the cost of the algorithm (in terms of ESJD) increases with dimension N, we adopt the widely used approach of deriving a diffusion limit for the Markov chain produced by the MALA algorithm. We study this problem for a class of target measures which is not in product form and we address the situation of practical relevance in which the algorithm is started out of stationarity. We thereby significantly extend previous works which consider either measures of product form, when the Markov chain is started out of stationarity, or non-product measures (defined via a density with respect to a Gaussian), when the Markov chain is started in stationarity. In order to work in this non-stationary and non-product setting, significant new analysis is required. In particular, our diffusion limit comprises a stochastic PDE coupled to a scalar ordinary differential equation which gives a measure of how far from stationarity the process is. The family of non-product target measures that we consider in this paper are found from discretization of a measure on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space; the discretised measure is defined by its density with respect to a Gaussian random field. The results of this paper demonstrate that, in the non-stationary regime, the cost of the algorithm is of \({{\mathcal {O}}}(N^{1/2})\) in contrast to the stationary regime, where it is of \({{\mathcal {O}}}(N^{1/3})\).","Juan Kuntz1, Michela Ottobre

0,"Implicit Regularization in Nonconvex Statistical Estimation: Gradient Descent Converges Linearly for Phase Retrieval, Matrix Completion, and Blind Deconvolution","Recent years have seen a flurry of activities in designing provably efficient nonconvex procedures for solving statistical estimation problems. Due to the highly nonconvex nature of the empirical loss, state-of-the-art procedures often require proper regularization (e.g., trimming, regularized cost, projection) in order to guarantee fast convergence. For vanilla procedures such as gradient descent, however, prior theory either recommends highly conservative learning rates to avoid overshooting, or completely lacks performance guarantees. This paper uncovers a striking phenomenon in nonconvex optimization: even in the absence of explicit regularization, gradient descent enforces proper regularization implicitly under various statistical models. In fact, gradient descent follows a trajectory staying within a basin that enjoys nice geometry, consisting of points incoherent with the sampling mechanism. This “implicit regularization” feature allows gradient descent to proceed in a far more aggressive fashion without overshooting, which in turn results in substantial computational savings. Focusing on three fundamental statistical estimation problems, i.e., phase retrieval, low-rank matrix completion, and blind deconvolution, we establish that gradient descent achieves near-optimal statistical and computational guarantees without explicit regularization. In particular, by marrying statistical modeling with generic optimization theory, we develop a general recipe for analyzing the trajectories of iterative algorithms via a leave-one-out perturbation argument. As a by-product, for noisy matrix completion, we demonstrate that gradient descent achieves near-optimal error control—measured entrywise and by the spectral norm—which might be of independent interest.","Cong Ma1, Kaizheng Wang1, Yuejie Chi2 & …Yuxin Chen",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-019-09429-9,"Nonconvex optimization,Gradient descent,Leave-one-out analysis,Phase retrieval,Matrix completion,Blind deconvolution"
0,Generation of the Exact Distribution and Simulation of Matched Nucleotide Sequences on a Phylogenetic Tree,"Nucleotide sequences are often generated by Monte Carlo simulations to address complex evolutionary or analytic questions but the simulations are rarely described in sufficient detail to allow the research to be replicated. Here we briefly review the Markov processes of substitution in a pair of matching (homologous) nucleotide sequences and then extend it to k matching nucleotide sequences. We describe calculation of the joint distribution of nucleotides of two matching sequences. Based on this distribution, we give a method for simulation of the divergence matrix for n sites using the multinomial distribution. This is then extended to the joint distribution for k nucleotide sequences and the corresponding 4k divergence array, generalizing Felsenstein (Journal of Molecular Evolution, 17, 368–376, 1981), who considered stationary, homogeneous and reversible processes on trees. We give a second method to generate matched sequences that begins with a random ancestral sequence and applies a continuous Markov process to each nucleotide site as in Rambaut and Grassly (Computer Applications in the Biosciences, 13, 235–238, 1997); further, we relate this to an equivalent approach based on an embedded Markov chain. Finally, we describe an approximate method that was recently implemented in a program developed by Jermiin et al. (Applied Bioinformatics, 2, 159–163, 2003). The three methods presented here cater for different computational and mathematical limitations and are shown in an example to produce results close to those expected on theoretical grounds. All methods are implemented using functions in the S-plus or R languages.","Faisal Ababneh1, Lars S.

0,Sparse Harmonic Transforms: A New Class of Sublinear-Time Algorithms for Learning Functions of Many Variables,"In this paper we develop fast and memory efficient numerical methods for learning functions of many variables that admit sparse representations in terms of general bounded orthonormal tensor product bases. Such functions appear in many applications including, e.g., various Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) problems involving the solution of parametric PDE that are approximately sparse in Chebyshev or Legendre product bases (Chkifa et al. in Polynomial approximation via compressed sensing of high-dimensional functions on lower sets. arXiv:1602.05823, 2016; Rauhut and Schwab in Math Comput 86(304):661–700, 2017). We expect that our results provide a starting point for a new line of research on sublinear-time solution techniques for UQ applications of the type above which will eventually be able to scale to significantly higher-dimensional problems than what are currently computationally feasible. More concretely, let \({\mathcal {B}}\) be a finite Bounded Orthonormal Product Basis (BOPB) of cardinality \(|{\mathcal {B}}| = N\). Herein we will develop methods that rapidly approximate any function f that is sparse in the BOPB, that is, \(f: {\mathcal {D}} \subset {\mathbb {R}}^D \rightarrow {\mathbb {C}}\) of the form $$\begin{aligned} f(\varvec{x}) = \sum _{b \in {\mathcal {S}}} c_b \cdot b(\varvec{x}) \end{aligned}$$with \({\mathcal {S}} \subset {\mathcal {B}}\) of cardinality \(|{\mathcal {S}}| = s \ll N\). Our method adapts the CoSaMP algorithm (Needell and Tropp in Appl Comput Harmon Anal 26(3):301–321, 2009) to use additional function samples from f along a randomly constructed grid \({\mathcal {G}} \subset {\mathbb {R}}^D\) with universal approximation properties in order to rapidly identify the multi-indices of the most dominant basis functions in \({\mathcal {S}}\) component by component during each CoSaMP iteration. It has a runtime of just \((s \log N)^{{\mathcal {O}}(1)}\), uses only \((s \log N)^{{\mathcal {O}}(1)}\) function evaluations on the fixed and nonadaptive grid \({\mathcal {G}}\), and requires not more than \((s \log N)^{{\mathcal {O}}(1)}\) bits of memory. We emphasize that nothing about \({\mathcal {S}}\) or any of the coefficients \(c_b \in {\mathbb {C}}\) is assumed in advance other than that \({\mathcal {S}} \subset {\mathcal {B}}\) has \(|{\mathcal {S}}| \le s\). Both \({\mathcal {S}}\) and its related coefficients \(c_b\) will be learned from the given function evaluations by the developed method. For \(s\ll N\), the runtime \((s \log N)^{{\mathcal {O}}(1)}\) will be less than what is required to simply enumerate the elements of the basis \({\mathcal {B}}\); thus our method is the first approach applicable in a general BOPB framework that falls into the class referred to as sublinear-time. This and the similarly reduced sample and memory requirements set our algorithm apart from previous works based on standard compressive sensing algorithms such as basis pursuit which typically store and utilize full intermediate basis representations of size \(\varOmega (N)\) during the solution process.","Bosu Choi1, Mark A.

Due to multi-dimensional performance fees that are charged whenever each fund profit exceeds its historical maximum, the value function is expected to be multi-dimensional. New mathematical challenges arise as the standard dimension reduction cannot be applied, and the convexity of the value function and Isaacs condition may not hold in our probability minimization problem with drift uncertainty. We propose to employ the stochastic Perron’s method to characterize the value function as the unique viscosity solution to the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation without resorting to the proof of dynamic programming principle. The required comparison principle is also established in our setting to close the loop of stochastic Perron’s method.","Junbeom Lee

0,The Local Convexity of Solving Systems of Quadratic Equations,"This paper considers the recovery of a rank r positive semidefinite matrix \({X X^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}}\) from m scalar measurements of the form \({y_i := a_i^T X X^T a_i}\) (i.e., quadratic measurements of X). Such problems arise in a variety of applications, including covariance sketching of high-dimensional data streams, quadratic regression, quantum state tomography, among others. A natural approach to this problem is to minimize the loss function \({f(U) = \sum_i (y_i - a_{i}^{T}UU^{T}a_i)^2}\) which has an entire manifold of solutions given by \({\{XO\}_{O\in\mathcal{O}_r}}\) where \({\mathcal{O}_r}\) is the orthogonal group of \({r\times r}\) orthogonal matrices; this is non-convex in the \({n\times r}\) matrix U, but methods like gradient descent are simple and easy to implement (as compared to semidefinite relaxation approaches). In this paper we show that once we have \({m \geq Cnr\,{\rm log}^2(n)}\) samples from isotropic gaussian \({a_i}\), with high probability (a) this function admits a dimension-independent region of local strong convexity on lines perpendicular to the solution manifold, and (b) with an additional polynomial factor of r samples, a simple spectral initialization will land within the region of convexity with high probability. Together, this implies that gradient descent with initialization (but no re-sampling) will converge linearly to the correct X, up to an orthogonal transformation. We believe that this general technique (local convexity reachable by spectral initialization) should prove applicable to a broader class of nonconvex optimization problems.","Sujay Sanghavi1, Rachel Ward2 & Chris D.

0,A Mathematical Framework for Modelling the Metastatic Spread of Cancer,"Cancer is a complex disease that starts with mutations of key genes in one cell or a small group of cells at a primary site in the body. If these cancer cells continue to grow successfully and, at some later stage, invade the surrounding tissue and acquire a vascular network, they can spread to distant secondary sites in the body. This process, known as metastatic spread, is responsible for around 90% of deaths from cancer and is one of the so-called hallmarks of cancer. To shed light on the metastatic process, we present a mathematical modelling framework that captures for the first time the interconnected processes of invasion and metastatic spread of individual cancer cells in a spatially explicit manner—a multigrid, hybrid, individual-based approach. This framework accounts for the spatiotemporal evolution of mesenchymal- and epithelial-like cancer cells, membrane-type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and the diffusible matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and for their interactions with the extracellular matrix. Using computational simulations, we demonstrate that our model captures all the key steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade, i.e. invasion by both heterogeneous cancer cell clusters and by single mesenchymal-like cancer cells; intravasation of these clusters and single cells both via active mechanisms mediated by matrix-degrading enzymes (MDEs) and via passive shedding; circulation of cancer cell clusters and single cancer cells in the vasculature with the associated risk of cell death and disaggregation of clusters; extravasation of clusters and single cells; and metastatic growth at distant secondary sites in the body. By faithfully reproducing experimental results, our simulations support the evidence-based hypothesis that the membrane-bound MT1-MMP is the main driver of invasive spread rather than diffusible MDEs such as MMP-2.","Linnea C.

0,On Reverse Hypercontractivity,"We study the notion of reverse hypercontractivity. We show that reverse hypercontractive inequalities are implied by standard hypercontractive inequalities as well as by the modified log-Sobolev inequality. Our proof is based on a new comparison lemma for Dirichlet forms and an extension of the Stroock–Varopoulos inequality. A consequence of our analysis is that all simple operators \({L = Id - \mathbb{E}}\) as well as their tensors satisfy uniform reverse hypercontractive inequalities. That is, for all q < p < 1 and every positive valued function f for \({t \geq \log \frac{1-q}{1-p}}\) we have \({\| e^{-tL}f\|_{q} \geq \| f\|_{p}}\). This should be contrasted with the case of hypercontractive inequalities for simple operators where t is known to depend not only on p and q but also on the underlying space. The new reverse hypercontractive inequalities established here imply new mixing and isoperimetric results for short random walks in product spaces, for certain card-shufflings, for Glauber dynamics in high-temperatures spin systems as well as for queueing processes. The inequalities further imply a quantitative Arrow impossibility theorem for general product distributions and inverse polynomial bounds in the number of players for the non-interactive correlation distillation problem with m-sided dice.","Elchanan Mossel1,2, Krzysztof Oleszkiewicz3 & Arnab Sen",Geometric and Functional Analysis,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00039-013-0229-4,"Primary: 60E15,Secondary: 60J27"

Chi and Kim (1998) show that when the phases of the generalized Grover database search operator are optimally chosen, it is capable of finding a solution by a single query. To apply this method to global optimization requires knowledge of the number of marked points m to calculate the optimal phases, but this value is seldom known. This paper focuses on overcoming this hurdle by showing that an estimate of the optimal phases can be found and used to replace the optimal phases while maintaining a high probability of finding a solution.

It converts a set of observed data points of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables via an orthogonal transformation. To handle streaming data and reduce the complexities of PCA, (subspace) online PCA iterations were proposed to iteratively update the orthogonal transformation by taking one observed data point at a time. Existing works on the convergence of (subspace) online PCA iterations mostly focus on the case where the samples are almost surely uniformly bounded. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of a subspace online PCA iteration under more practical assumption and obtain a nearly optimal finite-sample error bound. Our convergence rate almost matches the minimax information lower bound. We prove that the convergence is nearly global in the sense that the subspace online PCA iteration is convergent with high probability for random initial guesses.

We assume \(r<Q\) and analyze the system using an embedded Markov process at the replenishment points. Using the queueing and Markov chain decomposition approach, we characterize the distribution of the residual lead time and derive the stationary distribution of the inventory level. We construct closed-form expressions for the expected total long-run average cost function. The closed form allows us to efficiently obtain, numerically, the optimal Q and r parameters. Numerical study provides several guidelines for the optimal control. For example, we show that approximating the lead time distribution by an exponential one only works when the optimal reorder point of the approximation is very small; in other cases the usage of the exact distribution can lead to substantial cost savings (up to 14%).

0,Spatial mixing and the connective constant: optimal bounds,"We study the problem of deterministic approximate counting of matchings and independent sets in graphs of bounded connective constant. More generally, we consider the problem of evaluating the partition functions of the monomer-dimer model (which is defined as a weighted sum over all matchings where each matching is given a weight \(\gamma ^{|V| - 2 |M|}\) in terms of a fixed parameter \(\gamma \) called the monomer activity) and the hard core model (which is defined as a weighted sum over all independent sets where an independent set I is given a weight \(\lambda ^{|I|}\) in terms of a fixed parameter \(\lambda \) called the vertex activity). The connective constant is a natural measure of the average degree of a graph which has been studied extensively in combinatorics and mathematical physics, and can be bounded by a constant even for certain unbounded degree graphs such as those sampled from the sparse Erdős–Rényi model \(\mathcal {G}(n, d/n)\). Our main technical contribution is to prove the best possible rates of decay of correlations in the natural probability distributions induced by both the hard core model and the monomer-dimer model in graphs with a given bound on the connective constant. These results on decay of correlations are obtained using a new framework based on the so-called message approach that has been extensively used recently to prove such results for bounded degree graphs. We then use these optimal decay of correlations results to obtain fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTASs) for the two problems on graphs of bounded connective constant. In particular, for the monomer-dimer model, we give a deterministic FPTAS for the partition function on all graphs of bounded connective constant for any given value of the monomer activity. The best previously known deterministic algorithm was due to Bayati et al. (Proc. 39th ACM Symp. Theory Comput., pp. 122–127, 2007), and gave the same runtime guarantees as our results but only for the case of bounded degree graphs. For the hard core model, we give an FPTAS for graphs of connective constant \(\varDelta \) whenever the vertex activity \(\lambda < \lambda _c(\varDelta )\), where \(\lambda _c(\varDelta ) :=\frac{\varDelta ^\varDelta }{(\varDelta - 1)^{\varDelta + 1}}\); this result is optimal in the sense that an FPTAS for any \(\lambda > \lambda _c(\varDelta )\) would imply that NP=RP (Sly and Sun, Ann.

The heavy computational demands of standard approaches to this problem severely limit the size of datasets that may be analyzed, in both the number of species and the number of genetic loci. Here we provide a theoretical pointer to more efficient methods, by showing that logDet distances computed from genomic-scale sequences retain sufficient information to recover network relationships in the level-1 ultrametric case. This result is obtained under the Network Multispecies Coalescent model combined with a mixture of General Time-Reversible sequence evolution models across individual gene trees. It applies to both unlinked site data, such as for SNPs, and to sequence data in which many contiguous sites may have evolved on a common tree, such as concatenated gene sequences. Thus under standard stochastic models statistically justifiable inference of network relationships from sequences can be accomplished without consideration of individual genes or gene trees.","Elizabeth S.

0,A Formalism for Evaluating Analytically the Cross-Correlation Structure of a Firing-Rate Network Model,"We introduce a new formalism for evaluating analytically the cross-correlation structure of a finite-size firing-rate network with recurrent connections. The analysis performs a first-order perturbative expansion of neural activity equations that include three different sources of randomness: the background noise of the membrane potentials, their initial conditions, and the distribution of the recurrent synaptic weights. This allows the analytical quantification of the relationship between anatomical and functional connectivity, i.e. of how the synaptic connections determine the statistical dependencies at any order among different neurons. The technique we develop is general, but for simplicity and clarity we demonstrate its efficacy by applying it to the case of synaptic connections described by regular graphs. The analytical equations so obtained reveal previously unknown behaviors of recurrent firing-rate networks, especially on how correlations are modified by the external input, by the finite size of the network, by the density of the anatomical connections and by correlation in sources of randomness. In particular, we show that a strong input can make the neurons almost independent, suggesting that functional connectivity does not depend only on the static anatomical connectivity, but also on the external inputs. Moreover we prove that in general it is not possible to find a mean-field description à la Sznitman of the network, if the anatomical connections are too sparse or our three sources of variability are correlated. To conclude, we show a very counterintuitive phenomenon, which we call stochastic synchronization, through which neurons become almost perfectly correlated even if the sources of randomness are independent. Due to its ability to quantify how activity of individual neurons and the correlation among them depends upon external inputs, the formalism introduced here can serve as a basis for exploring analytically the computational capability of population codes expressed by recurrent neural networks.","Diego Fasoli1,2, Olivier Faugeras1 & Stefano Panzeri",The Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience (JMN),2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13408-015-0020-y,"Functional connectivity,Neural networks,Firing-rate network model,Perturbative theory,Stochastic systems,Graph theory"

In particular, the limiting law of the first time a given swap appears in a random sorting network is identified with the limiting distribution of the closest to 0 eigenvalue in the antisymmetric GUE. Moreover, the asymptotic gap, in the bulk, between appearances of a given swap is the Gaudin–Mehta law—the limiting universal distribution for gaps between eigenvalues of real symmetric random matrices.

Subgraphs which contain all vertices of Γ, have no cycles, and no finite connected components are called essential spanning forests. The set \(Y\) of all such subgraphs can be endowed with a compact topology, and G acts on \(Y\) by translations. We define a “uniform” G-invariant probability measure μ on \(Y\) show that μ is mixing, and give a sufficient condition for directional tail triviality. For non-cocompact Fuchsian groups we show how μ can be computed on cylinder sets.

The model accounts for spatial or directional dependence of cell speed and cell turning behavior to predict a constitutive cell flux equation with drift velocity and diffusivity tensor (termed random motility tensor) that are explicit functions of the parameters of the underlying random walk model. This model provides the connection between cell locomotion and the resulting persistent random walk behavior to the observed cell migration on longer time scales, thus it provides a framework for interpreting cell migration data in terms of underlying motility mechanisms.",Richard B.

0,1D log gases and the renormalized energy: crystallization at vanishing temperature,"We study the statistical mechanics of a one-dimensional log gas or \(\beta \)-ensemble with general potential and arbitrary \(\beta \), the inverse of temperature, according to the method we introduced for two-dimensional Coulomb gases in Sandier and Serfaty (Ann Probab, 2014). Such ensembles correspond to random matrix models in some particular cases. The formal limit \(\beta =\infty \) corresponds to “weighted Fekete sets” and is also treated. We introduce a one-dimensional version of the “renormalized energy” of Sandier and Serfaty (Commun Math Phys 313(3):635–743, 2012), measuring the total logarithmic interaction of an infinite set of points on the real line in a uniform neutralizing background. We show that this energy is minimized when the points are on a lattice. By a suitable splitting of the Hamiltonian we connect the full statistical mechanics problem to this renormalized energy \(W\), and this allows us to obtain new results on the distribution of the points at the microscopic scale: in particular we show that configurations whose \(W\) is above a certain threshold (which tends to \(\min W\) as \(\beta \rightarrow \infty \)) have exponentially small probability. This shows that the configurations have increasing order and crystallize as the temperature goes to zero.","Etienne Sandier1,2 & Sylvia Serfaty3,4,",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-014-0585-5,"82B05,82B21,82B26,15B52"
0,"Applications of random sampling in computational geometry, II","We use random sampling for several new geometric algorithms. The algorithms are “Las Vegas,” and their expected bounds are with respect to the random behavior of the algorithms. These algorithms follow from new general results giving sharp bounds for the use of random subsets in geometric algorithms. These bounds show that random subsets can be used optimally for divide-and-conquer, and also give bounds for a simple, general technique for building geometric structures incrementally. One new algorithm reports all the intersecting pairs of a set of line segments in the plane, and requiresO(A+n logn) expected time, whereA is the number of intersecting pairs reported. The algorithm requiresO(n) space in the worst case. Another algorithm computes the convex hull ofn points inE

0,A General Meta-Heuristic Based Solver for Combinatorial Optimisation Problems,"In recent years, there have been many studies in which tailored heuristics and meta-heuristics have been applied to specific optimisation problems. These codes can be extremely efficient, but may also lack generality. In contrast, this research focuses on building a general-purpose combinatorial optimisation problem solver using a variety of meta-heuristic algorithms including Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search. The system is novel because it uses a modelling environment in which the solution is stored in dense dynamic list structures, unlike a more conventional sparse vector notation. Because of this, it incorporates a number of neighbourhood search operators that are normally only found in tailored codes and it performs well on a range of problems. The general nature of the system allows a model developer to rapidly prototype different problems. The new solver is applied across a range of traditional combinatorial optimisation problems. The results indicate that the system achieves good performance in terms of solution quality and runtime.",Marcus Randall & David Abramso,Computational Optimization and Applications,2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1011211220465,"combinatorial optimisation,meta-heuristic search algorithms,linked lists"
0,A Graph-Based Approach for the Approximate Solution of the Chemical Master Equation,"The chemical master equation (CME) represents the accepted stochastic description of chemical reaction kinetics in mesoscopic systems. As its exact solution—which gives the corresponding probability density function—is possible only in very simple cases; there is a clear need for approximation techniques. Here, we propose a novel perturbative three-step approach, which draws heavily on graph theory: (i) we expand the eigenvalues of the transition state matrix in the CME as a series in a nondimensional parameter that depends on the reaction rates and the reaction volume; (ii) we derive an analogous series for the corresponding eigenvectors via a graph-based algorithm; (iii) we combine the resulting expansions into an approximate solution to the CME. We illustrate our approach by applying it to a reversible dimerization reaction; then we formulate a set of conditions, which ensure its applicability to more general reaction networks, and we verify those conditions for two common catalytic mechanisms. Comparing our results with the linear-noise approximation (LNA), we find that our methodology is consistently more accurate for sufficiently small values of the nondimensional parameter. This superior accuracy is particularly evident in scenarios characterized by small molecule numbers, which are typical of conditions inside biological cells.","Raffaele Basile1, Ramon Grima1 & Nikola Popović",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-013-9864-z,"Chemical master equation,Graph theory"

This is achieved via the star–triangle transformation, by transporting the box-crossing property across the family of isoradial graphs. As a consequence, we obtain the universality of these models at the critical point, in the sense that the one-arm and \(2j\)-alternating-arm critical exponents (and therefore also the connectivity and volume exponents) are constant across the family of such percolation processes. The isoradial graphs in question are those that satisfy certain weak conditions on their embedding and on their track system.

0,Multi-attribute mate choice decisions and uncertainty in the decision process: a generalized sequential search strategy,"The behavior of females in search of a mate determines the likelihood that high quality males are encountered and adaptive search strategies rely on the effective use of available information on the quality of prospective mates. The sequential search strategy was formulated, like most models of search behavior, on the assumption that females obtain perfect information on the quality of encountered males. In this paper, we modify the strategy to allow for uncertainty of male quality and we determine how the magnitude of this uncertainty and the ability of females to inspect multiple male attributes to reduce uncertainty influence mate choice decisions. In general, searchers are sensitive to search costs and higher costs lower acceptance criteria under all versions of the model. The choosiness of searchers increases with the variability of the quality of prospective mates under conditions of the original model, but under conditions of uncertainty the choosiness of searchers may increase or decrease with the variability of inspected male attributes. The behavioral response depends on the functional relationship between observed male attributes and the fitness return to searchers and on costs associated with the search process. Higher uncertainty often induces searchers to pay more for information and under conditions of uncertainty the fitness return to searchers is never higher than under conditions of the original model. Further studies of the performance of alternative search strategies under conditions of uncertainty may consequently be necessary to identify search strategies likely to be used under natural conditions.","Daniel D.

0,"A Nearly Quadratic Bound for Point-Location in Hyperplane Arrangements, in the Linear Decision Tree Model","We consider the point location problem in an arrangement of n arbitrary hyperplanes in any dimension d, in the linear decision tree model, in which we only count linear comparisons involving the query point, and all other operations do not explicitly access the query and are for free. We mainly consider the simpler variant (which arises in many applications) where we only want to determine whether the query point lies on some input hyperplane. We present an algorithm that performs a point location query with \(O(d^2\log n)\) linear comparisons, improving the previous best result by about a factor of d. Our approach is a variant of Meiser’s technique for point location (Inf Comput 106(2):286–303, 1993) (see also Cardinal et al. in: Proceedings of the 24th European symposium on algorithms, 2016), and its improved performance is due to the use of vertical decompositions in an arrangement of hyperplanes in high dimensions, rather than bottom-vertex triangulation used in the earlier approaches. The properties of such a decomposition, both combinatorial and algorithmic (in the standard real RAM model), are developed in a companion paper (Ezra et al. arXiv:1712.02913, 2017), and are adapted here (in simplified form) for the linear decision tree model. Several applications of our algorithm are presented, such as the k-SUM problem and the Knapsack and SubsetSum problems. However, these applications have been superseded by the more recent result of Kane et al. (in: Proceedings of the 50th ACM symposium on theory of computing, 2018), obtained after the original submission (and acceptance) of the conference version of our paper (Ezra and Sharir in: Proceedings of the 33rd international symposium on computational geometry, 2017). This result only applies to ‘low-complexity’ hyperplanes (for which the \(\ell _1\)-norm of their coefficient vector is a small integer), which arise in the aforementioned applications. Still, our algorithm has currently the best performance for arbitrary hyperplanes.","Esther Ezra

0,On fluidization of discrete event models: observation and control of continuous Petri nets,"As a preliminary overview, this work provides first a broad tutorial on the fluidization of discrete event dynamic models, an efficient technique for dealing with the classical state explosion problem. Even if named as continuous or fluid, the relaxed models obtained are frequently hybrid in a technical sense. Thus, there is plenty of room for using discrete, hybrid and continuous model techniques for logical verification, performance evaluation and control studies. Moreover, the possibilities for transferring concepts and techniques from one modeling paradigm to others are very significant, so there is much space for synergy. As a central modeling paradigm for parallel and synchronized discrete event systems, Petri nets (PNs) are then considered in much more detail. In this sense, this paper is somewhat complementary to David and Alla (2010). Our presentation of fluid views or approximations of PNs has sometimes a flavor of a survey, but also introduces some new ideas or techniques. Among the aspects that distinguish the adopted approach are: the focus on the relationships between discrete and continuous PN models, both for untimed, i.e., fully non-deterministic abstractions, and timed versions; the use of structure theory of (discrete) PNs, algebraic and graph based concepts and results; and the bridge to Automatic Control Theory. After discussing observability and controllability issues, the most technical part in this work, the paper concludes with some remarks and possible directions for future research.","Manuel Silva1, Jorge Júlvez1, Cristian Mahulea1 & …C.

Analogues of the first and second Kolmogorov equations for the family of processes under consideration are obtained by using a procedure for obtaining integro-differential equations describing Markov processes with discontinuous trajectories. These equations turn out to be equations in fractional derivatives. The results are based on an asymptotic analysis of the transition probability as the start and end times of the transition approach each other.

The two objectives defined are to minimise the maximum and the average tardiness of the jobs. Due to fuzziness in the due dates, the two objectives become fuzzy too.

0,Simultaneously Applying Multiple Mutation Operators in Genetic Algorithms,"The mutation operation is critical to the success of genetic algorithms since it diversifies the search directions and avoids convergence to local optima. The earliest genetic algorithms use only one mutation operator in producing the next generation. Each problem, even each stage of the genetic process in a single problem, may require appropriately different mutation operators for best results. Determining which mutation operators should be used is quite difficult and is usually learned through experience or by trial-and-error. This paper proposes a new genetic algorithm, the dynamic mutation genetic algorithm, to resolve these difficulties. The dynamic mutation genetic algorithm simultaneously uses several mutation operators in producing the next generation. The mutation ratio of each operator changes according to evaluation results from the respective offspring it produces. Thus, the appropriate mutation operators can be expected to have increasingly greater effects on the genetic process. Experiments are reported that show the proposed algorithm performs better than most genetic algorithms with single mutation operators.","Tzung-Pei Hong1, Hong-Shung Wang2 & Wei-Chou Chen",Journal of Heuristics,2000,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1009642825198,"genetic algorithm,dynamic mutation,fitness value,generation,offspring,mutation ratio"

To address the challenge of the complicated decision-making environment and decision makers’ expression habits for the selection of financial products, this paper develops the incomplete additive probabilistic linguistic preference relation to depict decision makers’ preferences. Considering that, when decision makers express their opinions using probabilistic linguistic preference relation, it is possible that the sum of the value of the probability information is more than 1, this paper also extends the concepts of probabilistic linguistic term set, additive probabilistic linguistic preference relation and incomplete additive probabilistic linguistic preference relation to improve and ensure their practicability. Moreover, an “inverse prospect theory-based” algorithm is proposed to choose proper financial products. The algorithm processes the original incomplete additive probabilistic linguistic preference relation by using the inverse functions of the prospect theory at first. Then, a priority weights deriving model is established based on the extended concepts.

0,Continuum and discrete approach in modeling biofilm development and structure: a review,"The scientific community has recognized that almost 99% of the microbial life on earth is represented by biofilms. Considering the impacts of their sessile lifestyle on both natural and human activities, extensive experimental activity has been carried out to understand how biofilms grow and interact with the environment. Many mathematical models have also been developed to simulate and elucidate the main processes characterizing the biofilm growth. Two main mathematical approaches for biomass representation can be distinguished: continuum and discrete. This review is aimed at exploring the main characteristics of each approach. Continuum models can simulate the biofilm processes in a quantitative and deterministic way. However, they require a multidimensional formulation to take into account the biofilm spatial heterogeneity, which makes the models quite complicated, requiring significant computational effort. Discrete models are more recent and can represent the typical multidimensional structural heterogeneity of biofilm reflecting the experimental expectations, but they generate computational results including elements of randomness and introduce stochastic effects into the solutions.","M.

0,Optimization and Control of Agent-Based Models in Biology: A Perspective,"Agent-based models (ABMs) have become an increasingly important mode of inquiry for the life sciences. They are particularly valuable for systems that are not understood well enough to build an equation-based model. These advantages, however, are counterbalanced by the difficulty of analyzing and using ABMs, due to the lack of the type of mathematical tools available for more traditional models, which leaves simulation as the primary approach. As models become large, simulation becomes challenging. This paper proposes a novel approach to two mathematical aspects of ABMs, optimization and control, and it presents a few first steps outlining how one might carry out this approach. Rather than viewing the ABM as a model, it is to be viewed as a surrogate for the actual system. For a given optimization or control problem (which may change over time), the surrogate system is modeled instead, using data from the ABM and a modeling framework for which ready-made mathematical tools exist, such as differential equations, or for which control strategies can explored more easily. Once the optimization problem is solved for the model of the surrogate, it is then lifted to the surrogate and tested. The final step is to lift the optimization solution from the surrogate system to the actual system. This program is illustrated with published work, using two relatively simple ABMs as a demonstration, Sugarscape and a consumer-resource ABM. Specific techniques discussed include dimension reduction and approximation of an ABM by difference equations as well systems of PDEs, related to certain specific control objectives. This demonstration illustrates the very challenging mathematical problems that need to be solved before this approach can be realistically applied to complex and large ABMs, current and future. The paper outlines a research program to address them.","G. An1, B. G. Fitzpatrick

The order \(O(\sqrt{p})\) coincides with that of Burkholder’s inequality and is therefore optimal as \(p\rightarrow \infty \). Our result improves and unifies several existing maximal estimates and is even new in case X is a Hilbert space. Similar results are obtained if the driving martingale \(g_t\,\mathrm{d} W_t\) is replaced by more general X-valued martingales \(\,\mathrm{d} M_t\). Moreover, our methods allow for random evolution systems, a setting which appears to be completely new as far as maximal inequalities are concerned. As a second application, for a large class of time discretisation schemes (including splitting, implicit Euler, Crank-Nicholson, and other rational schemes) we obtain stability and pathwise uniform convergence of time discretisation schemes for solutions of linear SPDEs $$\begin{aligned} \,\mathrm{d} u_t = A(t)u_t\,\mathrm{d} t + g_t\,\mathrm{d} W_t, \quad u_0 = 0, \end{aligned}$$where the family \((A(t))_{t\in [0,T]}\) is assumed to generate a \(C_0\)-evolution family \((S(t,s))_{0\leqslant s\leqslant t\leqslant T}\) of contractions on a 2-smooth Banach spaces X. Under spatial smoothness assumptions on the inhomogeneity g, contractivity is not needed and explicit decay rates are obtained. In the parabolic setting this sharpens several know estimates in the literature; beyond the parabolic setting this seems to provide the first systematic approach to pathwise uniform convergence to time discretisation schemes.","Jan van Neerven1 & Mark Veraar

0,Monte Carlo method for fractional-order differentiation extended to higher orders,"In this work the Monte Carlo method, introduced recently by the authors for orders of differentiation between zero and one, is further extended to differentiation of orders higher than one. Two approaches have been developed on this way. The first approach is based on interpreting the coefficients of the Grünwald–Letnikov fractional differences as so called signed probabilities, which in the case of orders higher than one can be negative or positive. We demonstrate how this situation can be processed and used for computations. The second approach uses the Monte Carlo method for orders between zero and one and the semi-group property of fractional-order differences. Both methods have been implemented in MATLAB and illustrated by several examples of fractional-order differentiation of several functions that typically appear in applications. Computational results of both methods were in mutual agreement and conform with the exact fractional-order derivatives of the functions used in the examples.",Nikolai Leonenko1 & Igor Podlubny,Fractional Calculus and Applied Analysis,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13540-022-00048-w,"fractional calculus (primary),fractional differentiation,numerical computations,Monte Carlo method,stochastic processes"
0,Compressed Sensing and Matrix Completion with Constant Proportion of Corruptions,"In this paper, we improve existing results in the field of compressed sensing and matrix completion when sampled data may be grossly corrupted. We introduce three new theorems. (1) In compressed sensing, we show that if the m×n sensing matrix has independent Gaussian entries, then one can recover a sparse signal x exactly by tractable ℓ
1 minimization even if a positive fraction of the measurements are arbitrarily corrupted, provided the number of nonzero entries in x is O(m/(log(n/m)+1)). (2) In the very general sensing model introduced in Candès and Plan (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 57(11):7235–7254, 2011) and assuming a positive fraction of corrupted measurements, exact recovery still holds if the signal now has O(m/(log2
n)) nonzero entries. (3) Finally, we prove that one can recover an n×n low-rank matrix from m corrupted sampled entries by tractable optimization provided the rank is on the order of O(m/(nlog2
n)); again, this holds when there is a positive fraction of corrupted samples.",Xiaodong Li,Constructive Approximation,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00365-012-9176-9,"Compressed sensing,Matrix completion,Robust PCA,Convex optimization,Restricted isometry property,Golfing scheme"
0,Efficient and Secure Delegation of Exponentiation in General Groups to a Single Malicious Server,"Group exponentiation is an important and relatively expensive operation used in many public-key cryptosystems and, more generally, cryptographic protocols. To expand the applicability of these solutions to computationally weaker devices, it has been advocated that this operation is delegated from a computationally weaker client to a computationally stronger server. In the case of a single, possibly malicious, server, this problem has remained open since the introduction of a formal model. In previous work we have proposed practical and secure solutions applicable to two classes of specific groups, related to well-known cryptosystems. In this paper, we investigate this problem in a general class of multiplicative groups, possibly going beyond groups currently subject to quantum cryptanalysis attacks. Our main results are efficient delegation protocols for exponentiation in these general groups. The main technique in our results is a reduction of the protocol’s security probability (i.e., the probability that a malicious server convinces a client of an incorrect exponentiation output) that is more efficient than by standard parallel repetition. The resulting protocols satisfy natural requirements such as correctness, security, privacy and efficiency, even if the adversary uses the full power of quantum computers. In particular, in our protocols the client performs a number of online group multiplications smaller by 1–2 orders of magnitude than in a non-delegated computation.","Giovanni Di Crescenzo1, Matluba Khodjaeva2, Delaram Kahrobaei3 & …Vladimir Shpilrain",Mathematics in Computer Science,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11786-020-00462-4,"Secure outsourcing,Secure delegating,Group exponentiation,Cryptography,Group theory"

0,The general mixing of addicts and needles in a variable-infectivity needle-sharing environment, In this paper we develop and analyse a model for the spread of HIV/AIDS amongst a population of injecting drug users. The model we discuss focuses on the transmission of HIV through the sharing of contaminated drug injection equipment and in particular we examine the mixing of addicts and needles when the AIDS incubation period is divided into three distinct infectious stages. The impact of this assumption is to greatly increase the complexity of the HIV transmission mechanism. We begin the paper with a brief literature review followed by the derivation of a model which incorporates three classes of infectious addicts and three classes of infectious needles and where a general probability structure is used to represent the interaction of addicts and needles of varying levels of infectivity. We find that if the basic reproductive number is less than or equal to unity then there exists a globally stable disease free equilibrium. The model possesses an endemic equilibrium solution if the basic reproductive number exceeds unity. We then conduct a brief simulation study of our model. We find that the spread of disease is heavily influenced by the way addicts and needles of different levels of infectivity interact.,David Greenhalgh1 & Fraser Lewis,Journal of Mathematical Biology,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002850200140,"Simulation Study,Incubation Period,Stable Disease,Drug User,Drug Injection"

0,Adaptive multiple crossover genetic algorithm to solve workforce scheduling and routing problem,"The workforce scheduling and routing problem refers to the assignment of personnel to visits, across various geographical locations. Solving this problem demands tackling numerous scheduling and routing constraints while aiming to minimise the operational cost. One of the main obstacles in designing a genetic algorithm for this problem is selecting the best set of operators that enable better GA performance. This paper presents a novel adaptive multiple crossover genetic algorithm to tackle the combined setting of scheduling and routing problems. A mix of problem-specific and traditional crossovers are evaluated by using an online learning process to measure the operator’s effectiveness. Best operators are given high application rates and low rates are given to the worse. Application rates are dynamically adjusted according to the learning outcomes in a non-stationary environment. Experimental results show that the combined performances of all the operators were better than using only one operator used in isolation. This study provided an important opportunity to advance the understanding of the best method to use crossover operators for this highly-constrained optimisation problem effectively.","Haneen Algethami

It is a theorem of Noam Berger (Commun. Math. Phys., 2002) that if \(0<\alpha <d\) then there is no infinite cluster at the critical parameter \(\beta _c\). We give a new, quantitative proof of this theorem establishing the power-law upper bound $$\begin{aligned} {\mathbf {P}}_{\beta _c}\bigl (|K|\ge n\bigr ) \le C n^{-(d-\alpha )/(2d+\alpha )} \end{aligned}$$for every \(n\ge 1\), where K is the cluster of the origin. We believe that this is the first rigorous power-law upper bound for a Bernoulli percolation model that is neither planar nor expected to exhibit mean-field critical behaviour. As part of the proof, we establish a universal inequality implying that the maximum size of a cluster in percolation on any finite graph is of the same order as its mean with high probability. We apply this inequality to derive a new rigorous hyperscaling inequality \((2-\eta )(\delta +1)\le d(\delta -1)\) relating the cluster-volume exponent \(\delta \) and two-point function exponent \(\eta \).","Tom Hutchcroft

0,Statistical analysis of DNA fingerprint data for ordered clone physical mapping of human chromosomes,"A statistical framework is proposed for analysing DNA fingerprint data from experiments aimed at constructing ordered clone physical maps of chromosomes. The fingerprint data consists of the lengths and hybridization states of restriction digest fragments and the paper develops a solution to the fundamental problem of deciding whether or not two randomly selected clones overlap. Overlap probabilities are calculated using Bayes’ rule together with appropriate statistical descriptions of the chromosome and experimental procedure. The analysis is flexible, allowing a variety of assumptions to account for experimental errors and difficulties, such as unobserved fragments. The approach described here provides a basis for predicting the rate of progress of an experimental protocol and hence for comparing alternate protocols. It is readily generalized to related problems with a wide range of possible data.

Most of the time, these analyses can be reduced to estimating the probability of occurrence of an undesirable event, also called failure probability, using a stochastic model of the system. If the considered event is rare, sophisticated sample-based procedures are generally introduced to get a relevant estimate of the failure probability. Based on the samples constructed for the evaluation of this estimate, this work considers two types of reliability-oriented sensitivity indices (ROSI). The first ones are introduced to identify the model inputs whose variability has to be reduced in priority to decrease this probability. The second ones are used to find the model inputs whose distribution has to be particularly well-characterized for the available estimate to be realistic. It is also shown how these ROSI can be derived when the true model is approximated by a surrogate model. In particular, an innovative procedure is proposed to take into account the surrogate model uncertainty in the estimation of these ROSI.

We study a stochastic Hindmarsh-Rose model using Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate how noise, in conjunction with subthreshold resonance, leads to a preferred frequency in the firing pattern. The resulting stochastic resonance (SR) exhibits a preferred firing frequency that is approximately exponential in its dependence on the noise amplitude. In similar experiments, frequency dependent SR is found in the reliability of detection of alpha-function inputs under noise, which are more realistic inputs for neurons. A mathematical analysis of the equations reveals that the frequency preference arises from the dynamics of the slow variable. Noise can then transfer the resonance over the firing threshold because of the proximity of the fast subsystem to a Hopf bifurcation point.

0,A concept of copula robustness and its applications in quantitative risk management,"In financial and actuarial applications, marginal risks and their dependence structure are often modelled separately. While it is sometimes reasonable to assume that the marginal distributions are ‘known’, it is usually quite involved to obtain information on the copula (dependence structure). Therefore copula models used in practice are quite often only rough guesses. For many purposes, it is thus relevant to know whether certain characteristics derived from \(d\)-variate risks are robust with respect to (at least small) deviations in the copula. In this article, a general concept of copula robustness is introduced and criteria for copula robustness are presented. These criteria are illustrated by means of several examples from quantitative risk management. The concept of aggregation robustness introduced by Embrechts et al. (Finance Stoch. 19:763–790, 2015) can be embedded in our framework of copula robustness.",Henryk Zähle,Finance and Stochastics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-022-00485-8,"Copula,Fréchet class,

0,Quantifying Heuristics in the Ordinal Optimization Framework ,"Finding the optimal design for a discrete event dynamic system (DEDS) is in general difficult due to the large search space and the simulation-based performance evaluation. Various heuristics have been developed to find good designs. An important question is how to quantify the goodness of the heuristic designs. Inspired by the Ordinal Optimization, which has become an important tool for optimizing DEDS, we provide a method which can quantify the goodness of the design. By comparing with a set of designs that are uniformly sampled, we measure the ordinal performances of heuristic designs, i.e., we quantify the ranks of all (or some of) the heuristic designs among all the designs in the entire search space. The mathematical tool we use is the Hypothesis Testing, and the probability of making Type II error in the quantification is controlled to be under a very low level. The method can be used both when the performances of the designs can be accurately evaluated and when such performances are estimated by a crude but computationally easy model. The method can quantify both heuristics that output a single design and that output a set of designs. The method is demonstrated through numerical examples.","Zhen Shen1,2, Qian-Chuan Zhao2 & Qing-Shan Jia",Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10626-009-0087-2,"Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,Ordinal Optimization,Heuristic,Hypothesis Testing"

The analysis is based on a stochastic process called Hesitant Adaptive Search with Power-Law Improvement Distribution (HASPLID).

We note that sensor provided information generally has a probabilistic type of uncertainty whereas linguistic information typically introduces a possibilistic type of uncertainty. More generally, we are faced with a problem in which we must fuse information with different types of uncertainty. In order to provide a unified framework for the representation of these different types of uncertain information we use a set measure approach for the representation of uncertain information. We discuss a set measure representation of uncertain information. In the multi-source fusion problem, in addition to having a collection of pieces of information that must be fused, we need to have some expert provided instructions on how to fuse these pieces of information. Generally these instructions can involve a combination of linguistically and mathematically expressed directions. In the course of this work we begin to consider the fundamental task of how to translate these instructions into formal operations that can be applied to our information.

In this paper, we introduce both proportional and fixed transaction costs, which leads to a more realistic scenario. In mathematical terms, the problem is now of impulse control type. Its solution is characterized and calculated by iteration of associated optimal stopping problems.

An important attribute of the proposed methodology is that it facilitates an explicit control of the existing trade-off between the computational tractability of the employed formulation and the performance of the derived policies. Furthermore, by posing the eventually defined problem as a constrained nonlinear programming formulation, the presented methodology inherits all the analytical tools and insights that are offered by that vast area of optimization theory.

Upon exit from \(D_N\), the walk lands on a “boundary vertex” and then reenters \(D_N\) through a random boundary edge in the next step. In the parametrization by the local time at the “boundary vertex” we prove that, at times corresponding to a \(\theta \)-multiple of the cover time of \(D_N\), the sets of suitably defined \(\lambda \)-thick (i.e., heavily visited) and \(\lambda \)-thin (i.e., lightly visited) points are, as \(N\rightarrow \infty \), distributed according to the Liouville Quantum Gravity \(Z^D_\lambda \) with parameter \(\lambda \)-times the critical value. For \(\theta <1\), also the set of avoided vertices (a.k.a. late points) and the set where the local time is of order unity are distributed according to \(Z^D_{\sqrt{\theta }}\).

0,Inexact Variable Metric Stochastic Block-Coordinate Descent for Regularized Optimization,"Block-coordinate descent is a popular framework for large-scale regularized optimization problems with block-separable structure. Existing methods have several limitations. They often assume that subproblems can be solved exactly at each iteration, which in practical terms usually restricts the quadratic term in the subproblem to be diagonal, thus losing most of the benefits of higher-order derivative information. Moreover, in contrast to the smooth case, non-uniform sampling of the blocks has not yet been shown to improve the convergence rate bounds for regularized problems. This work proposes an inexact randomized block-coordinate descent method based on a regularized quadratic subproblem, in which the quadratic term can vary from iteration to iteration: a “variable metric.” We provide a detailed convergence analysis for both convex and non-convex problems. Our analysis generalizes, to the regularized case, Nesterov’s proposal for improving convergence of block-coordinate descent by sampling proportional to the blockwise Lipschitz constants. We improve the convergence rate in the convex case by weakening the dependency on the initial objective value. Empirical results also show that significant benefits accrue from the use of a variable metric.

0,Macroscopic coherent structures in a stochastic neural network: from interface dynamics to coarse-grained bifurcation analysis,"We study coarse pattern formation in a cellular automaton modelling a spatially-extended stochastic neural network. The model, originally proposed by Gong and Robinson (Phys Rev E 85(5):055,101(R), 2012), is known to support stationary and travelling bumps of localised activity. We pose the model on a ring and study the existence and stability of these patterns in various limits using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. In a purely deterministic version of the model, posed on a continuum, we construct bumps and travelling waves analytically using standard interface methods from neural field theory. In a stochastic version with Heaviside firing rate, we construct approximate analytical probability mass functions associated with bumps and travelling waves. In the full stochastic model posed on a discrete lattice, where a coarse analytic description is unavailable, we compute patterns and their linear stability using equation-free methods. The lifting procedure used in the coarse time-stepper is informed by the analysis in the deterministic and stochastic limits. In all settings, we identify the synaptic profile as a mesoscopic variable, and the width of the corresponding activity set as a macroscopic variable. Stationary and travelling bumps have similar meso- and macroscopic profiles, but different microscopic structure, hence we propose lifting operators which use microscopic motifs to disambiguate them. We provide numerical evidence that waves are supported by a combination of high synaptic gain and long refractory times, while meandering bumps are elicited by short refractory times.","Daniele Avitable1 & Kyle C.

The formation of these seed banks is especially important for disturbance specialist plants, as seeds of these species germinate only in disturbed soil. Seed movement caused by disturbances affects the survival and germination probability of seeds in the seed bank, which subsequently affect population dynamics. In this paper, we develop a stochastic integral projection model for a general disturbance specialist plant-seed bank population that takes into account both the frequency and intensity of random disturbances, as well as vertical seed movement and density-dependent seedling establishment. We show that the probability measures associated with the plant-seed bank population converge weakly to a unique measure, independent of initial population. We also show that the population either persists with probability one or goes extinct with probability one, and provides a sharp criteria for this dichotomy. We apply our results to an example motivated by wild sunflower (Helianthus annuus) populations, and explore how the presence or absence of a “storage effect” impacts how a population responds to different disturbance scenarios.","Eric Alan Eager1, Richard Rebarber2 & Brigitte Tenhumberg",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-014-9978-y,"Disturbance specialist,Seed bank,Integral Projection Model,Weak convergence,Density dependence,Storage effect"

Weyl, in [42]) with respect to the probability distribution of condition numbers of numerical analysis.

0,Randomized linear algebra for model reduction. Part I: Galerkin methods and error estimation,"We propose a probabilistic way for reducing the cost of classical projection-based model order reduction methods for parameter-dependent linear equations. A reduced order model is here approximated from its random sketch, which is a set of low-dimensional random projections of the reduced approximation space and the spaces of associated residuals. This approach exploits the fact that the residuals associated with approximations in low-dimensional spaces are also contained in low-dimensional spaces. We provide conditions on the dimension of the random sketch for the resulting reduced order model to be quasi-optimal with high probability. Our approach can be used for reducing both complexity and memory requirements. The provided algorithms are well suited for any modern computational environment. Major operations, except solving linear systems of equations, are embarrassingly parallel. Our version of proper orthogonal decomposition can be computed on multiple workstations with a communication cost independent of the dimension of the full order model. The reduced order model can even be constructed in a so-called streaming environment, i.e., under extreme memory constraints. In addition, we provide an efficient way for estimating the error of the reduced order model, which is not only more efficient than the classical approach but is also less sensitive to round-off errors. Finally, the methodology is validated on benchmark problems.","Oleg Balabanov1,2 & Anthony Nouy",Advances in Computational Mathematics,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10444-019-09725-6,"Model reduction,Reduced basis,Proper orthogonal decomposition,Random sketching,Subspace embedding"
0,"Transience, recurrence and the speed of a random walk in a site-based feedback environment","We study a random walk on \({\mathbb {Z}}\) which evolves in a dynamic environment determined by its own trajectory. Sites flip back and forth between two modes, p and q. R consecutive right jumps from a site in the q-mode are required to switch it to the p-mode, and L consecutive left jumps from a site in the p-mode are required to switch it to the q-mode. From a site in the p-mode the walk jumps right with probability p and left with probability \(1-p\), while from a site in the q-mode these probabilities are q and \(1-q\). We prove a sharp cutoff for right/left transience of the random walk in terms of an explicit function of the parameters \(\alpha = \alpha (p,q,R,L)\). For \(\alpha > 1/2\) the walk is transient to \(+\infty \) for any initial environment, whereas for \(\alpha < 1/2\) the walk is transient to \(-\infty \) for any initial environment. In the critical case, \(\alpha = 1/2\), the situation is more complicated and the behavior of the walk depends on the initial environment. Nevertheless, we are able to give a characterization of transience/recurrence in many instances, including when either \(R=1\) or \(L=1\) and when \(R=L=2\). In the noncritical case, we also show that the walk has positive speed, and in some situations are able to give an explicit formula for this speed.",Ross G. Pinsky1 & Nicholas F.

0,Conditional rehabilitation of cooperation under strategic uncertainty,"In order to address the topic of the tragedy of the commons, more specifically that of tropical forest ecosystems explored as common-pool resources endowed with public-good features and exposed to deforestation risks, we consider game-theoretic population dynamics contingent on various differential equations. We propose an evolutionary model handed down to the Price theorem of selection. In a set of model-players evolving in strategic uncertainty and subject to certain mutation toward cooperation, the Price equation evens out unstructured and structured population replicator dynamics. According to the model outputs, avoiding the tragedy of the commons can be achieved on condition that half of the population temporarily exhibits a cooperative behavior. Furthermore, cooperative model-players ought to be rewarded at a level equivalent to the joint selection of cooperators and competitors issued from the unifying Price identity.

0,A jump to default extended CEV model: an application of Bessel processes,"We develop a flexible and analytically tractable framework which unifies the valuation of corporate liabilities, credit derivatives, and equity derivatives. We assume that the stock price follows a diffusion, punctuated by a possible jump to zero (default). To capture the positive link between default and equity volatility, we assume that the hazard rate of default is an increasing affine function of the instantaneous variance of returns on the underlying stock. To capture the negative link between volatility and stock price, we assume a constant elasticity of variance (CEV) specification for the instantaneous stock volatility prior to default. We show that deterministic changes of time and scale reduce our stock price process to a standard Bessel process with killing. This reduction permits the development of completely explicit closed form solutions for risk-neutral survival probabilities, CDS spreads, corporate bond values, and European-style equity options. Furthermore, our valuation model is sufficiently flexible so that it can be calibrated to exactly match arbitrarily given term structures of CDS spreads, interest rates, dividend yields, and at-the-money implied volatilities.",Peter Carr1 & Vadim Linetsky,Finance and Stochastics,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-006-0012-6,"Default,Credit spread,Corporate bonds,Equity derivatives,Credit derivatives,Implied volatility skew,CEV model,Bessel processes"

We only assume the finite trace of the kernel (Hilbert–Schmidt embedding into \(L_2\)) and provide several concrete estimates with precise constants for the corresponding worst-case errors. In general, our analysis does not need any additional assumptions and also includes the case of non-Mercer kernels and also non-separable RKHS. The fail probability is controlled and decays polynomially in n, the number of samples. Under the mild additional assumption of separability we observe improved rates of convergence related to the decay of the singular values.

0,Fault Diagnosis of Discretely Controlled Continuous Systems by Means of Discrete-Event Models,"Discretely controlled continuous systems consist of continuous plants whose operation mode is switched by a feedback controller. Fault diagnosis has to use the measured switching sequence and the measured continuous movement to detect and identify faults. In order to get the diagnostic algorithm with the least possible complexity, the kind of measurement information and the granularity of the model have to be chosen in accordance with the faults to be detected. The paper presents five diagnostic methods in a uniform way, which differ with respect to the model and the measurement information used. From the hybrid model of discretely controlled continuous systems, four more abstract representations are derived, which have the form of embedded maps, semi-Markov processes, timed automata and nondeterministic automata. The validity of the diagnostic result is ensured by the claim that the models should be complete and, hence, consistent with all the input-output sequences of the discretely controlled system in the appropriate fault case. In this way a hierarchy of models and of diagnostic results is obtained. The methods are illustrated by an example.",Jan Lunze,Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10626-007-0022-3,"Hybrid system,Fault diagnosis,Model abstraction,Completeness,Embedded map,Semi-Markov process,Timed automaton,Nondeterministic automaton"

We consider various relaxations of the polyhedral set of achievable matching probabilities, introduce valid inequalities, and discuss when they are facet-defining.

A combinatorial explosion hinders working with distance to a measure as an ordinary power distance function.

0,Natural selection in compartmentalized environment with reshuffling,"The emerging field of high-throughput compartmentalized in vitro evolution is a promising new approach to protein engineering. In these experiments, libraries of mutant genotypes are randomly distributed and expressed in microscopic compartments—droplets of an emulsion. The selection of desirable variants is performed according to the phenotype of each compartment. The random partitioning leads to a fraction of compartments receiving more than one genotype making the whole process a lab implementation of the group selection. From a practical point of view (where efficient selection is typically sought), it is important to know the impact of the increase in the mean occupancy of compartments on the selection efficiency. We carried out a theoretical investigation of this problem in the context of selection dynamics for an infinite non-mutating subdivided population that randomly colonizes an infinite number of patches (compartments) at each reproduction cycle. We derive here an update equation for any distribution of phenotypes and any value of the mean occupancy. Using this result, we demonstrate that, for the linear additive fitness, the best genotype is still selected regardless of the mean occupancy. Furthermore, the selection process is remarkably resilient to the presence of multiple genotypes per compartments, and slows down approximately inversely proportional to the mean occupancy at high values. We extend out results to more general expressions that cover nonadditive and non-linear fitnesses, as well non-Poissonian distribution among compartments. Our conclusions may also apply to natural genetic compartmentalized replicators, such as viruses or early trans-acting RNA replicators.","A. S. Zadorin

We assume that the underlying graphG satisfies a strong isoperimetric inequality and that the transition operatorP is strongly reversible, uniformly irreducible and satisfies a uniform first moment condition. We prove that under these hypotheses the random walk converges almost surely to a random end ofG and that the Dirichlet problem forP-harmonic functions is solvable with respect to the end compactification If in addition the graph as a metric space is hyperbolic in the sense of Gromov, then the same conclusions also hold for the hyperbolic compactification in the place of the end compactification. The main tool is the exponential decay of the transition probabilities implied by the strong isoperimetric inequality. Finally, it is shown how the same technique can be applied to Brownian motion to obtain analogous results for Riemannian manifolds satisfying Cheeger's isoperimetric inequality.

We use them to find the precise homeomorphism type of the r-Martin boundary, which describes r-harmonic functions, for every \(r\le R\). We also define a notion of spectral degeneracy along parabolic subgroups which is crucial to describe the homeomorphism type of the R-Martin boundary. Finally, we give a criterion for (strong) stability of the Martin boundary in the sense of Picardello and Woess (in: Potential theory, de Gruyter, 1992) in terms of spectral degeneracy. We then prove that this criterion is always satisfied in small rank, so that in particular, the Martin boundary of an admissible symmetric finitely supported probability measure on a geometrically finite Kleinian group of dimension at most 5 is always strongly stable.

0,Cumulative weighting optimization,"Global optimization problems with limited structure (e.g., convexity or differentiability of the objective function) can arise in many fields. One approach to solving these problems is by modeling the evolution of a probability density function over the solution space, similar to the Fokker–Planck equation for diffusions, such that at each time instant, additional weight is given to better solutions. We propose an addition to the class of model-based methods, cumulative weighting optimization (CWO), whose general version can be proven convergent to an optimal solution and stable under disturbances (e.g., floating point inaccuracy). These properties encourage us to design a class of CWO algorithms for solving global optimization problems. Beyond the general convergence and stability analysis, we prove that with some additional assumptions the Monte Carlo version of the CWO algorithm is also convergent and stable. Interestingly, the well known cross-entropy method is a CWO algorithm.",Kun Lin1 & Steven I.

0,Formal and computational modeling of anticipation mechanisms of resilience in the complex sociotechnical air transport system,"With ever-growing numbers of passengers and complexity of the air transport system, it becomes more and more of a challenge to manage the system in an effective, safe, and resilient manner. This is especially evident when disruptions occur. Understanding and improving resilience of the air transport system and its adaptive capacity to disruptions is essential for the system’s uninterrupted successful performance. Using theoretical findings from behavioral sciences, this paper makes the first steps towards formalization of the adaptive capacity of resilience of the air transport system with a particular focus on its ability to anticipate. To this end, an expressive logic-based language called Temporal Trace Language is used. The proposed approach is illustrated by a case study, in which anticipatory mechanisms are implemented in an agent-based airport terminal operations model, to deal with a disruptive scenario of unplanned and challenging passenger demand at the security checkpoint. Results showed that the timing of an adaptive action could have a significant influence on reducing the risk of saturation of the system, where saturation implies performance loss. Additionally, trade-off relations were obtained between cost, corresponding to the extra resources mobilized, and the benefits, such as a decrease in risk of saturation of the passenger queue.","Anne-Nynke Blok1,2, Alexei Sharpanskykh

0,A Large Deviations Analysis of Certain Qualitative Properties of Parallel Tempering and Infinite Swapping Algorithms,"Parallel tempering, or replica exchange, is a popular method for simulating complex systems. The idea is to run parallel simulations at different temperatures, and at a given swap rate exchange configurations between the parallel simulations. From the perspective of large deviations it is optimal to let the swap rate tend to infinity and it is possible to construct a corresponding simulation scheme, known as infinite swapping. In this paper we propose a novel use of large deviations for empirical measures for a more detailed analysis of the infinite swapping limit in the setting of continuous time jump Markov processes. Using the large deviations rate function and associated stochastic control problems we consider a diagnostic based on temperature assignments, which can be easily computed during a simulation. We show that the convergence of this diagnostic to its a priori known limit is a necessary condition for the convergence of infinite swapping. The rate function is also used to investigate the impact of asymmetries in the underlying potential landscape, and where in the state space poor sampling is most likely to occur.","J. Doll1, P.

0,Extractors for Small Zero-Fixing Sources,"Let V ⊆ [n] be a k-element subset of [n]. The uniform distribution on the 2k strings from {0, 1}n that are set to zero outside of V is called an (n, k)-zero-fixing source. An ϵ-extractor for (n, k)-zero-fixing sources is a mapping F: {0, 1}n → {0, 1}m, for some m, such that F(X) is ϵ-close in statistical distance to the uniform distribution on {0, 1}m for every (n, k)-zero-fixing source X. Zero-fixing sources were introduced by Cohen and Shinkar in [7] in connection with the previously studied extractors for bit-fixing sources. They constructed, for every μ > 0, an efficiently computable extractor that extracts a positive fraction of entropy, i.e., Ω(k) bits, from (n, k)-zero-fixing sources where k ≥ (log log n)2+μ.In this paper we present two different constructions of extractors for zero-fixing sources that are able to extract a positive fraction of entropy for k substantially smaller than log log n. The first extractor works for k ≥ C log log log n, for some constant C. The second extractor extracts a positive fraction of entropy for k ≥ log(i)n for any fixed i ∈ ℕ, where log(i) denotes i-times iterated logarithm. The fraction of extracted entropy decreases with i. The first extractor is a function computable in polynomial time in n; the second one is computable in polynomial time in n when k ≤ α log log n/log log log n, where α is a positive constant.Our results can also be viewed as lower bounds on some Ramsey-type properties. The main difference between the problems about extractors studied here and the standard Ramsey theory is that we study colorings of all subsets of size up to k while in Ramsey theory the sizes are fixed to k. However it is easy to derive results also for coloring of subsets of sizes equal to k. In Corollary 3.1 of Theorem 5.1 we show that for every l ∈ ℕ there exists β < 1 such that for every k and n, n ≤ expl (k), there exists a 2-coloring of k-tuples of elements of [n], \(\psi :\left({\matrix{{[n]} \cr k \cr}} \right) \to \left\{{- 1,1} \right\}\) such that for every V ⊆ [n], |V| = 2k, we have \(\left| {\sum\nolimits_{X \subseteq V,\left| X \right| = k} {\psi (X)}} \right| \le {\beta ^k}\left({\matrix{{2k} \cr k \cr}} \right)\) (Corollary 3.1 is more general — the number of colors may be more than 2).",Pavel Pudlák1 & Vojtĕch Rödl,Combinatorica,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00493-020-4626-7,"68Q87,05D10"

To obtain this upper bound, we show that the base transformation exhibits exponential slow recurrence to the singular set. The results are applied to semiflows modeling singular-hyperbolic attracting sets of \(C^2\) vector fields.

The evolution of continuous types follows either replicator dynamics Oechssler and Riedel (Econ Theory 17:141–162, 2001; J Econ Theory 107:223–252 2002) or gradient dynamics Friedman and Ostrov (J Math Econ 46:691–707, 2010; J Econ Theory 148:743–777, 2013). The techniques rely on a system of partial differential equations. Numerical solutions obtained through replicator and gradient dynamics highlight the differences and the similarities that arise under both approaches.

0,Statistical robustness in utility preference robust optimization models,"Utility preference robust optimization (PRO) concerns decision making problems where information on decision maker’s utility preference is incomplete and has to be elicited through partial information and the optimal decision is based on the worst case utility function elicited. A key assumption in the PRO models is that the true probability distribution is either known or can be recovered by real data generated by the true distribution. In data-driven optimization, this assumption may not be satisfied when perceived data differ from real data and consequently it raises a question as to whether statistical estimators of the PRO models based on perceived data are reliable. In this paper, we investigate the issue which is also known as qualitative robustness in the literature of statistics (Huber in Robust statistics, 3rd edn, Wiley, New York, 1981) and risk management (Krätschmer et al. in Finance Stoch 18:271–295, 2014). By utilizing the framework proposed by Krätschmer et al. (2014), we derive moderate sufficient conditions under which the optimal value and optimal solution of the PRO models are robust against perturbation of the exogenous uncertainty data, and examine how the tail behaviour of utility functions affects the robustness. Moreover, under some additional conditions on the Lipschitz continuity of the underlying functions with respect to random data, we establish quantitative robustness of the statistical estimators under the Kantorovich metric. Finally, we investigate uniform consistency of the optimal value and optimal solution of the PRO models. The results cover utility selection problems and stochastic optimization problems as special cases.","Shaoyan Guo1 & Huifu Xu

For large \(n\), a typical random graph locally behaves like a Galton–Watson tree with Poisson offspring distribution with mean \(\lambda \). Here, we study large deviations from this typical behavior within the framework of the local weak convergence of finite graph sequences. The associated rate function is expressed in terms of an entropy functional on unimodular measures and takes finite values only at measures supported on trees. We also establish large deviations for other commonly studied random graph ensembles such as the uniform random graph with given number of edges growing linearly with the number of vertices, or the uniform random graph with given degree sequence. To prove our results, we introduce a new configuration model which allows one to sample uniform random graphs with a given neighborhood distribution, provided the latter is supported on trees. We also introduce a new class of unimodular random trees, which generalizes the usual Galton Watson tree with given degree distribution to the case of neighborhoods of arbitrary finite depth.

0,Dynamic node packing,"We propose a dynamic version of the classical node packing problem, also called the stable set or independent set problem. The problem is defined by a node set, a node weight vector, and an edge probability vector. For every pair of nodes, an edge is present or not according to an independent Bernoulli random variable defined by the corresponding entry in the probability vector. At each step, the decision maker selects an available node that maximizes the expected weight of the final packing, and then observes edges adjacent to this node. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and show that it is NP-Hard even on star graphs. Next, we introduce relaxations of the problem’s achievable probabilities polytope, analogous to the linear and bilinear edge-based formulations in the deterministic case; we show that these relaxations can be weak, motivating a polyhedral study. We derive classes of valid inequalities arising from cliques, paths, and cycles. For cliques, we completely characterize the polytope and show that it is a submodular polyhedron. For both paths and cycles, we give an implicit representation of the polytope via a cut-generating linear program of polynomial size based on a compact dynamic programming formulation. Our computational results show that our inequalities can greatly reduce the upper bound and improve the linear relaxation’s gap, particularly when the instance’s expected density is high.","Christopher Muir1 & Alejandro Toriello

In the on-line version, random task characteristics (e.g., arrival times) are not known in advance. To bypass this difficulty, worst-case analysis may be used. This, however, does not make use of probability distributions and results in an overly conservative solution. In this paper, we develop a new approach which does not rely on worst-case analysis but provides a “best solution in probability” efficiently obtained by estimating the probability distribution of sample-path-optimal solutions.

Recent studies have showed that machine learning methods can be used to detect misinformation/fake news/rumors by detecting user’s behaviour. However, we can not implement this strategy for all users on a social network due to the limitation of budget. Therefore, it is critical to optimize the monitor/sensor placement to effectively detect misinformation. In this paper, we investigate Minimum Budget for Misinformation Detection problem which aims to find the smallest set of nodes to place monitors in a social network so that detection function is at least a given threshold. Beside showing the inapproximability of the problem under the well-known Independent Cascade diffusion model, we then propose three approximation algorithms including: Greedy, Sampling-based Misinformation Detection and Importance Sampling-based Misinformation Detection. Greedy is a deterministic approximation algorithm which utilizes the properties of monotone and submodular of the detection function. The rest is two randomized algorithms with provable guarantees based on developing two novel techniques (1) estimating detection function by using the concepts of influence sample and importance influence sample with proof of correctness, and (2) an algorithmic framework to select the solution with theoretical analysis.

The polytope \(C_{n,d}\) is called k-neighborly if for any indices \(0\le i_1<\cdots < i_k\le n\) the convex hull of the k points \(S_{i_1},\ldots , S_{i_k}\) is a \((k-1)\)-dimensional face of \(C_{n,d}\). We study the probability that \(C_{n,d}\) is k-neighborly in various high-dimensional asymptotic regimes, i.e. when n, d, and possibly also k diverge to \(\infty \). There is an explicit formula for the expected number of \((k-1)\)-dimensional faces of \(C_{n,d}\) which involves Stirling numbers of both kinds. Motivated by this formula, we introduce a distribution, called the Lah distribution, and study its properties. In particular, we provide a combinatorial interpretation of the Lah distribution in terms of random compositions and records, and explicitly compute its factorial moments. Limit theorems which we prove for the Lah distribution imply neighborliness properties of \(C_{n,d}\).

Clients and advisors therefore need reliable methodologies to match offered products and clients’ needs and risk appetite. In this paper, we show that the information provided by existing approaches such as sample illustrations and historical backtesting that are often used for comparing and explaining products is often insufficient or even misleading. We introduce an alternative methodology based on risk-return profiles, i.e. the (forward-looking) probability distribution of benefits. In a model with stochastic interest rates and equity returns including stochastic equity volatility, we derive risk-return profiles for various types of existing unit-linked/equity-linked products with and without embedded guarantees. In contrast to previous work, we particularly take into account charges, effects resulting from regular premium payments and typical practical restrictions like borrowing constraints, hence providing applicable models adding insights to current political discussions on transparency regulations in several countries. We highlight the differences between actual product characteristics and the impression generated by existing approaches and explain the resulting misleading incentives for product developers and financial advisors.","Stefan Graf1, Alexander Kling2 & Jochen Ruß",European Actuarial Journal,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13385-012-0049-1,"Stochastic modelling,Financial planning,Product comparisons"

Structures that return objects of a base that represent the exact answer to a search query and also structures for approximate similarity search are presented (the latter structures do not guarantee precision, but usually return results close to exact and operate faster than structures for exact search).

0,Large Deviations and Gradient Flows for the Brownian One-Dimensional Hard-Rod System,"We study a system of hard rods of finite size in one space dimension, which move by Brownian noise while avoiding overlap. We consider a scaling in which the number of particles tends to infinity while the volume fraction of the rods remains constant; in this limit the empirical measure of the rod positions converges almost surely to a deterministic limit evolution. We prove a large-deviation principle on path space for the empirical measure, by exploiting a one-to-one mapping between the hard-rod system and a system of non-interacting particles on a contracted domain. The large-deviation principle naturally identifies a gradient-flow structure for the limit evolution, with clear interpretations for both the driving functional (an ‘entropy’) and the dissipation, which in this case is the Wasserstein dissipation. This study is inspired by recent developments in the continuum modelling of multiple-species interacting particle systems with finite-size effects; for such systems many different modelling choices appear in the literature, raising the question how one can understand such choices in terms of more microscopic models. The results of this paper give a clear answer to this question, albeit for the simpler one-dimensional hard-rod system. For this specific system this result provides a clear understanding of the value and interpretation of different modelling choices, while giving hints for more general systems.","Mark Peletier

We call them walks on the slit plane. We count them by their length, and by the coordinates of their endpoint. The corresponding three variable is algebraic of degree 8. Moreover, for any point (i, j), the length for walks of this type ending at (i, j) is also algebraic, of degree 2 or 4, and involves the famous Catalan numbers.Our method is based on the solution of a functional equation, established via a simple combinatorial argument. It actually works for more general models, in which walks take their steps in a finite subset of ℤ2 satisfying two simple conditions. The corresponding are always algebraic.In the second part of the paper, we derive from our enumerative results a number of probabilistic corollaries. For instance, we can compute exactly the probability that an ordinary random walk starting from (i, j) hits for the first time the half-line  at position (k, 0), for any triple (i, j, k). This generalizes a question raised by R. Kenyon, which was the starting point of this paper.Taking uniformly at random all n-step walks on the slit plane, we also compute the probability that they visit a given point (k, 0), and the average number of visits to this point.

0,Be-CoDiS: A Mathematical Model to Predict the Risk of Human Diseases Spread Between Countries—Validation and Application to the 2014–2015 Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic,"Ebola virus disease is a lethal human and primate disease that currently requires a particular attention from the international health authorities due to important outbreaks in some Western African countries and isolated cases in the UK, the USA and Spain. Regarding the emergency of this situation, there is a need for the development of decision tools, such as mathematical models, to assist the authorities to focus their efforts in important factors to eradicate Ebola. In this work, we propose a novel deterministic spatial–temporal model, called Between-Countries Disease Spread (Be-CoDiS), to study the evolution of human diseases within and between countries. The main interesting characteristics of Be-CoDiS are the consideration of the movement of people between countries, the control measure effects and the use of time-dependent coefficients adapted to each country. First, we focus on the mathematical formulation of each component of the model and explain how its parameters and inputs are obtained. Then, in order to validate our approach, we consider two numerical experiments regarding the 2014–2015 Ebola epidemic. The first one studies the ability of the model in predicting the EVD evolution between countries starting from the index cases in Guinea in December 2013. The second one consists of forecasting the evolution of the epidemic by using some recent data. The results obtained with Be-CoDiS are compared to real data and other model outputs found in the literature. Finally, a brief parameter sensitivity analysis is done.

0,Convergence of Constant Step Stochastic Gradient Descent for Non-Smooth Non-Convex Functions,"This paper studies the asymptotic behavior of the constant step Stochastic Gradient Descent for the minimization of an unknown function, defined as the expectation of a non convex, non smooth, locally Lipschitz random function. As the gradient may not exist, it is replaced by a certain operator: a reasonable choice is to use an element of the Clarke subdifferential of the random function; another choice is the output of the celebrated backpropagation algorithm, which is popular amongst practioners, and whose properties have recently been studied by Bolte and Pauwels. Since the expectation of the chosen operator is not in general an element of the Clarke subdifferential of the mean function, it has been assumed in the literature that an oracle of the Clarke subdifferential of the mean function is available. As a first result, it is shown in this paper that such an oracle is not needed for almost all initialization points of the algorithm. Next, in the small step size regime, it is shown that the interpolated trajectory of the algorithm converges in probability (in the compact convergence sense) towards the set of solutions of a particular differential inclusion: the subgradient flow. Finally, viewing the iterates as a Markov chain whose transition kernel is indexed by the step size, it is shown that the invariant distribution of the kernel converge weakly to the set of invariant distribution of this differential inclusion as the step size tends to zero. These results show that when the step size is small, with large probability, the iterates eventually lie in a neighborhood of the critical points of the mean function.","Pascal Bianchi1, Walid Hachem2 & Sholom Schechtman

0,Probabilistic convergence and stability of random mapper graphs,"We study the probabilistic convergence between the mapper graph and the Reeb graph of a topological space \({\mathbb {X}}\) equipped with a continuous function \(f: {\mathbb {X}}\rightarrow \mathbb {R}\). We first give a categorification of the mapper graph and the Reeb graph by interpreting them in terms of cosheaves and stratified covers of the real line \(\mathbb {R}\). We then introduce a variant of the classic mapper graph of Singh et al. (in: Eurographics symposium on point-based graphics, 2007), referred to as the enhanced mapper graph, and demonstrate that such a construction approximates the Reeb graph of \(({\mathbb {X}}, f)\) when it is applied to points randomly sampled from a probability density function concentrated on \(({\mathbb {X}}, f)\). Our techniques are based on the interleaving distance of constructible cosheaves and topological estimation via kernel density estimates. Following Munch and Wang (In: 32nd international symposium on computational geometry, volume 51 of Leibniz international proceedings in informatics (LIPIcs), Dagstuhl, Germany, pp 53:1–53:16, 2016), we first show that the mapper graph of \(({\mathbb {X}}, f)\), a constructible \(\mathbb {R}\)-space (with a fixed open cover), approximates the Reeb graph of the same space. We then construct an isomorphism between the mapper of \(({\mathbb {X}},f)\) to the mapper of a super-level set of a probability density function concentrated on \(({\mathbb {X}}, f)\). Finally, building on the approach of Bobrowski et al. (Bernoulli 23(1):288–328, 2017b), we show that, with high probability, we can recover the mapper of the super-level set given a sufficiently large sample. Our work is the first to consider the mapper construction using the theory of cosheaves in a probabilistic setting.

0,Algebraic expressions of conditional expectations in gene regulatory networks,"Gene Regulatory Networks are powerful models for describing the mechanisms and dynamics inside a cell. These networks are generally large in dimension and seldom yield analytical formulations. It was shown that studying the conditional expectations between dimensions (interactions or species) of a network could lead to drastic dimension reduction. These conditional expectations were classically given by solving equations of motions derived from the Chemical Master Equation. In this paper we deviate from this convention and take an Algebraic approach instead. That is, we explore the consequences of conditional expectations being described by a polynomial function. There are two main results in this work. Firstly, if the conditional expectation can be described by a polynomial function, then coefficients of this polynomial function can be reconstructed using the classical moments. And secondly, there are dimensions in Gene Regulatory Networks which inherently have conditional expectations with algebraic forms. We demonstrate through examples, that the theory derived in this work can be used to develop new and effective numerical schemes for forward simulation and parameter inference. The algebraic line of investigation of conditional expectations has considerable scope to be applied to many different aspects of Gene Regulatory Networks; this paper serves as a preliminary commentary in this direction.","Vikram Sunkara

0,An improved binary differential evolution algorithm for optimizing PWM control laws of power inverters,"Stochastic optimization methods inspired by biological evolution system have been widely employed to optimize PWM control laws of power inverters. But the existing approaches impose a serious computational burden and difficult parameter tuning issues. However, the differential evolution (DE) algorithm has the superiority of simple implementation and few parameters to tune. Thus, we propose an improved binary DE (IBDE) algorithm for optimizing PWM control laws of power inverters. The proposed algorithm focuses on the designs of the adaptive crossover and parameterless mutation strategies without imposing an additional computational burden. In numerical experiments, a single-phase full-bridge and two-level three-phase inverters are considered, and the optimal PWM control law is calculated to maximize the closeness of the controlled inductor current to sinusoidal reference current by using the proposed algorithm. Experimental results indicate that IBDE can obtain high quality output waveform that is a very good approximation to the sinusoidal reference waveform. Moreover, the spectrum analysis for the optimal PWM control law obtained by IBDE indicates that the lower odd-order harmonics are eliminated, while the existing peer algorithms cannot do well. We also carry out experiments on sensitivity analysis with respect to several important parameters.","Shuqu Qian1,2, Yongqiang Ye1, Yanmin Liu3 & …Guofeng Xu",Optimization and Engineering,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-017-9354-5,"Power inverters,PWM control laws,Differential evolution,Parameterless mutation,Adaptive crossover"

0,Large deviations for the largest eigenvalue of Gaussian networks with constant average degree,"Large deviation behavior of the largest eigenvalue \(\lambda _1\) of Wigner matrices including those arising from an Erdős-Rényi random graph \({\mathcal {G}}_{n,p}\) with i.i.d. random conductances on the edges has been the topic of considerable interest. However, despite several recent advances, not much is known when the underlying graph is sparse i.e., \(p\rightarrow 0\), except the recent works (Bhattacharya et al., Ann Probab 49(4):1847–1885, 2021and Bhattacharya and Ganguly, SIAM J Discret Math, 2020) which consider the simpler case of the graph without additional edge weights. Under sufficiently general conditions on the conductance distribution, one expects the ‘dense’ behavior as long as the average degree np is at least logarithmic in n. In this article we focus on the case of constant average degree i.e., \(p=\frac{d}{n}\) for some fixed \(d>0\) with standard Gaussian weights. Results in Bandeira and Van Handel (Ann Probab 44(4):2479–2506, 2016) about general non-homogeneous Gaussian matrices imply that in this regime \(\lambda _1\) scales like \(\sqrt{\log n}.\) We prove the following results towards a precise understanding of the large deviation behavior in this setting. 

1.
(Upper tail probabilities and structure theorem): For \(\delta >0,\) we pin down the exact exponent \(\psi (\delta )\) such that $$\begin{aligned} {\mathbb {P}}(\lambda _1\ge \sqrt{2(1+\delta )\log n})=n^{-\psi (\delta )+o(1)}. \end{aligned}$$ Further, we show that conditioned on the upper tail event, with high probability, a unique maximal clique emerges with a very precise \(\delta \) dependent size (takes either one or two possible values) and the Gaussian weights are uniformly high in absolute value on the edges in the clique. Finally, we also prove an optimal localization result for the leading eigenvector, showing that it allocates most of its mass on the aforementioned clique which is spread uniformly across its vertices.


2.
(Lower tail probabilities): The exact stretched exponential behavior $$\begin{aligned} {\mathbb {P}}(\lambda _1\le \sqrt{2(1-\delta )\log n})=\exp \left( -n^{\ell (\delta )+o(1)}\right) \end{aligned}$$ is also established.

 As an immediate corollary, one obtains that \(\lambda _1\) is typically \((1+o(1))\sqrt{2\log n}\), a result which surprisingly appears to be new. A key ingredient in our proofs is an extremal spectral theory for weighted graphs obtained by an \(\ell _1-\)reduction of the standard \(\ell _2-\)variational formulation of the largest eigenvalue via the classical Motzkin-Straus theorem [37], which could be of independent interest.",Shirshendu Ganguly1 & Kyeongsik Nam,Probability Theory and Related Fields,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-022-01164-7,"60F10,05C80,60B20,15A18"

0,Experimental Results Versus Computer Simulations of Noisy Poincaré Maps in an Intermittency Scenario,"Intermittency is a route to chaos when transitions between laminar and chaotic dynamics occur. The main attribute of intermittency is the reinjection mechanism, described by the reinjection probability density (RPD), which maps trajectories of the system from the chaotic region into the laminar one. The main results on chaotic intermittency strongly depend on the RPD. Recently a generalized power law RPD has been observed in a wide class of 1D maps. Noise has an impact on the intermittency phenomena and the generalized RPD introduces a novel scenario because it is affected by the noise. An analytical approach was introduced to estimate the noisy RPD (NRPD). In this work we investigate the noisy RPD in two cases: an experimental continuous system, by means of a Poincaré map associated to it, and a numerical map chosen close to the experimental one. In the experimental map we use the internal noise of the circuit, whereas in the numerical map we introduce the noise in the usual way.We have compared both noisy dynamics and found important differences between them, concerning the propagation of the noise effect from the maximum of the map (where the power law is generated) into the laminar region.To mimic the numerical map by the experiment, we introduced an external noise during a short window of time, obtaining similar results to the ones obtained in the internal natural noise case. We found that our methodology developed to study the noise intermittency can be used to investigate which class of noise is present in continuous systems.",Ezequiel del Rio1 & Sergio Elaskar,Regular and Chaotic Dynamics,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1560354720030041,"chaotic intermittency,electronic circuit,noise,Poincaré map"
0,Limits and fluctuations of p-adic random matrix products,"We show that singular numbers (also known as elementary divisors, invariant factors or Smith normal forms) of products and corners of random matrices over \({\mathbb {Q}}_p\) are governed by the Hall–Littlewood polynomials, in a structurally identical manner to the known relations between singular values of complex random matrices and Heckman–Opdam hypergeometric functions. This implies that the singular numbers of a product of corners of Haar-distributed elements of \(\mathrm {GL}_N({\mathbb {Z}}_p)\) form a discrete-time Markov chain distributed as a Hall–Littlewood process, with the number of matrices in the product playing the role of time. We give an exact sampling algorithm for the Hall–Littlewood processes which arise by relating them to an interacting particle system similar to PushTASEP. By analyzing the asymptotic behavior of this particle system, we show that the singular numbers of such products obey a law of large numbers and their fluctuations converge dynamically to independent Brownian motions. In the limit of large matrix size, we also show that the analogues of the Lyapunov exponents for matrix products have universal limits within this class of \(\mathrm {GL}_N({\mathbb {Z}}_p)\) corners.",Roger Van Peski,Selecta Mathematica,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00029-021-00709-3,"

0,"From Power Laws to Fractional Diffusion Processes with and Without External Forces, the Non Direct Way","In this paper, a wide view on the theory of the continuous time random walk (CTRW) and its relations to the space–time fractional diffusion process is given. We begin from the basic model of CTRW (Montroll and Weiss [19], 1965) that also can be considered as a compound renewal process. We are interested in studying the random walks in which the probability distributions of the waiting times and jumps have fat tails characterized by power laws with exponent between 0 and 1 for the waiting times, between 0 and 2 for the jumps. We prove the relation between the integral equation of the CTRW having the above fat tails waiting and jump width distributions and the space–time fractional diffusion equations in the Laplace–Fourier domain. The space–time fractional Fokker–Planck equation could also be driven from the discrete Ehren–Fest model and is represented by the theory of CTRW. These space–time fractional diffusion processes are getting increasing popularity in applications in physics, chemistry, finance, biology, medicine and many other fields. The asymptotic behavior of the Mittag–Leffler function plays a significant rule on simulating these models. The behaviors of the studied CTRW models are well approximated and visualized by simulating various types of random walks by using the Monte Carlo method.",Enstar A.

The presence of the process \(\nu \) prevents from directly applying classical results and novel estimates need to be derived. By making use of the so-called reference probability measure approach, we derive the Zakai equation satisfied by the unnormalized filtering process, and then we deduce the corresponding Kushner–Stratonovich equation. Under the condition that the jump times of the process \(\nu \) do not accumulate over the considered time horizon, we show that the unnormalized filtering process is the unique solution to the Zakai equation, in the class of measure-valued processes having a square-integrable density.

0,Information geometry,"Information geometry has emerged from the study of the invariant structure in families of probability distributions. This invariance uniquely determines a second-order symmetric tensor g and third-order symmetric tensor T in a manifold of probability distributions. A pair of these tensors (g, T) defines a Riemannian metric and a pair of affine connections which together preserve the metric. Information geometry involves studying a Riemannian manifold having a pair of dual affine connections. Such a structure also arises from an asymmetric divergence function and affine differential geometry. A dually flat Riemannian manifold is particularly useful for various applications, because a generalized Pythagorean theorem and projection theorem hold. The Wasserstein distance gives another important geometry on probability distributions, which is non-invariant but responsible for the metric properties of a sample space.

0,Certifying Global Optimality of Graph Cuts via Semidefinite Relaxation: A Performance Guarantee for Spectral Clustering,"Spectral clustering has become one of the most widely used clustering techniques when the structure of the individual clusters is non-convex or highly anisotropic. Yet, despite its immense popularity, there exists fairly little theory about performance guarantees for spectral clustering. This issue is partly due to the fact that spectral clustering typically involves two steps which complicated its theoretical analysis: First, the eigenvectors of the associated graph Laplacian are used to embed the dataset, and second, k-means clustering algorithm is applied to the embedded dataset to get the labels. This paper is devoted to the theoretical foundations of spectral clustering and graph cuts. We consider a convex relaxation of graph cuts, namely ratio cuts and normalized cuts, that makes the usual two-step approach of spectral clustering obsolete and at the same time gives rise to a rigorous theoretical analysis of graph cuts and spectral clustering. We derive deterministic bounds for successful spectral clustering via a spectral proximity condition that naturally depends on the algebraic connectivity of each cluster and the inter-cluster connectivity. Moreover, we demonstrate by means of some popular examples that our bounds can achieve near optimality. Our findings are also fundamental to the theoretical understanding of kernel k-means. Numerical simulations confirm and complement our analysis.

The system deforms the randomness of an input force sequence in proportion to its algorithmic complexity. The authors demonstrate this by numerical analysis of a one-dimensional vibrating elastic solid (the system) on which we apply a maximally-random force sequence (input). The level of complexity of the system is controlled via external parameters. The output response is the field of displacements observed at several positions on the body. The algorithmic complexity and stochasticity of the resulting output displacement sequence is measured and compared against the complexity of the system. The results show that the higher the system complexity, the more random-deficient the output sequence.","Joel Ratsaby1 & J.

0,Guaranteed clustering and biclustering via semidefinite programming,"Identifying clusters of similar objects in data plays a significant role in a wide range of applications. As a model problem for clustering, we consider the densest \(k\)-disjoint-clique problem, whose goal is to identify the collection of \(k\) disjoint cliques of a given weighted complete graph maximizing the sum of the densities of the complete subgraphs induced by these cliques. In this paper, we establish conditions ensuring exact recovery of the densest \(k\) cliques of a given graph from the optimal solution of a particular semidefinite program. In particular, the semidefinite relaxation is exact for input graphs corresponding to data consisting of \(k\) large, distinct clusters and a smaller number of outliers. This approach also yields a semidefinite relaxation with similar recovery guarantees for the biclustering problem. Given a set of objects and a set of features exhibited by these objects, biclustering seeks to simultaneously group the objects and features according to their expression levels. This problem may be posed as that of partitioning the nodes of a weighted bipartite complete graph such that the sum of the densities of the resulting bipartite complete subgraphs is maximized. As in our analysis of the densest \(k\)-disjoint-clique problem, we show that the correct partition of the objects and features can be recovered from the optimal solution of a semidefinite program in the case that the given data consists of several disjoint sets of objects exhibiting similar features.

Although boxicity was introduced in 1969 and studied extensively, there are no significant results on lower bounds for boxicity. In this paper, we develop two general methods for deriving lower bounds. Applying these methods we give several results, some of which are listed below:

The boxicity of a graph on n vertices with no universal vertices and minimum degree δ is at least n/2(n−δ−1).


2.
Consider the G(n;p) model of random graphs. Let p ≤ 1 − 40logn/n
2. Then with high probability, box(G) = Ω(np(1 − p)). On setting p = 1/2 we immediately infer that almost all graphs have boxicity Ω(n). Another consequence of this result is as follows: For any positive constant c < 1, almost all graphs on n vertices and

0,Boltzmann's ergodic hypothesis,"
Boltzmann's ergodic hypothesis is usually understood as the assumption that the trajectory of an isolated mechanical system runs through all states compatible with the total energy of the system. This understanding of Boltzmann stems from the Ehrenfests' review of the foundations of statistical mechanics in 1911. If Boltzmann's work is read with any attention, it becomes impossible to ascribe to him the claim that one single trajectory would fill the whole of state space. He admitted a continuous number of different possible mechanical trajectories. Ergodicity was formulated as the condition that only one integral of motion, the total energy, is preserved in time. The two reasons for this are external disturbing forces and collisions within the system. Boltzmann found it difficult to ascribe ergodic behavior to a single system where the theoretical dependence on initial conditions, though never observed, has to be admitted as possible. To circumvent the dependence, he invented the concept of a microcanonical ensemble.",Jan von Plato,Archive for History of Exact Sciences,1991,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00384333,"Total Energy,State Space,Mechanical System,Statistical Mechanic,Single System"

\({ SI}\) infection on a dynamic partnership network: characterization of \(R_0\)
","We model the spread of an \({ SI}\) (Susceptible \(\rightarrow \)
Infectious) sexually transmitted infection on a dynamic homosexual network. The network consists of individuals with a dynamically varying number of partners. There is demographic turnover due to individuals entering the population at a constant rate and leaving the population after an exponentially distributed time. Infection is transmitted in partnerships between susceptible and infected individuals. We assume that the state of an individual in this structured population is specified by its disease status and its numbers of susceptible and infected partners. Therefore the state of an individual changes through partnership dynamics and transmission of infection. We assume that an individual has precisely \(n\) ‘sites’ at which a partner can be bound, all of which behave independently from one another as far as forming and dissolving partnerships are concerned. The population level dynamics of partnerships and disease transmission can be described by a set of \((n+1)(n+2)\) differential equations. We characterize the basic reproduction ratio \(R_0\) using the next-generation-matrix method. Using the interpretation of \(R_0\) we show that we can reduce the number of states-at-infection \(n\) to only considering three states-at-infection. This means that the stability analysis of the disease-free steady state of an \((n+1)(n+2)\)-dimensional system is reduced to determining the dominant eigenvalue of a \(3\times 3\) matrix. We then show that a further reduction to a \(2\times 2\) matrix is possible where all matrix entries are in explicit form. This implies that an explicit expression for \(R_0\) can be found for every value of \(n\).","Ka Yin Leung1,2, Mirjam Kretzschmar2,3 & Odo Diekmann",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-014-0808-5,"

0,Model Checking for a Class of Weighted Automata,"A large number of different model checking approaches has been proposed during the last decade. The different approaches are applicable to different model types including untimed, timed, probabilistic and stochastic models. This paper presents a new framework for model checking techniques which includes some of the known approaches and enlarges the class of models to which model checking can be applied to the general class of weighted automata. The approach allows an easy adaption of model checking to models which have not been considered yet for this purpose. Examples for those new model types for which model checking can be applied are max/plus or min/plus automata which are well established models to describe different forms of dynamic systems and optimization problems. In this context, model checking can be used to verify temporal or quantitative properties of a system. The paper first presents briefly our class of weighted automata, as a very general model type. Then Valued Computational Tree Logic (CTL$) is introduced as a natural extension of the well known branching time logic CTL. Afterwards, algorithms to check a weighted automaton with respect to a CTL$ formula are presented. As a last result, bisimulation equivalence is extended to weighted automata and CTL$.",Peter Buchholz1 & Peter Kemper,Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10626-008-0057-0,"Finite automata,Weighted automata,Semirings,Model checking,Valued computational tree logic,Bisimulation"

The main examples are holomorphic foliations by Riemann surfaces in projective varieties. We introduce the heat equation relative to a positive \({\partial\overline\partial}\) -closed current and apply it to the directed currents associated with Riemann surface laminations possibly with singularities. This permits to construct the heat diffusion with respect to various Laplacians that could be defined almost everywhere with respect to the \({\partial\overline\partial}\) -closed current. We prove two kinds of ergodic theorems for such currents: one associated to the heat diffusion and one of geometric nature close to Birkhoff’s averaging on orbits of a dynamical system. Here the averaging is on hyperbolic leaves and the time is the hyperbolic time. The heat diffusion theorem with respect to a harmonic measure is also developed for real laminations.,"T.-C.

0,Bayes spaces: use of improper distributions and exponential families,"Bayes spaces are vector spaces of sigma-additive positive measures. Proportional measures are considered equivalent and can be represented by densities with respect to a fixed dominating measure. The addition in these spaces is perturbation. It corresponds to Bayes theorem, which appears as a linear operation. Bayes spaces, with continuous dominating measures, contain finite and infinite measures. Finite measures are equivalent to probability measures. Infinite measures include what in Bayesian statistics are called improper priors and non-integrable likelihood functions, justifying the use of such improper densities in Bayes theorem. Many concepts of probability theory can be handled in a natural way in the context of Bayes spaces. Particularly, an exponential family of probability densities appears as a cone contained in an affine subspace of the Bayes space. The framework of Bayes spaces allows an easy handling of exponential families and their extensions to improper distributions. Furthermore, the vector space structure of Bayes spaces allows the definition of derivatives of densities. In Bayesian statistics, these derivatives are a new tool to examine sensitivity of posterior distributions with respect to both observed data and prior changes.","J. J. Egozcue1 nAff2, V.

The method consists in obtaining a weight vector on the elements of P, so that an element is selected with a probability proportional to its weight. From some properties on the graph of adjacent linear extensions, it is shown that the probability distribution can be obtained by solving a linear system. The number of equations involved in this system relies on the number of what we have called positioned antichains, that allows a reduced number of equations. Finally, we give some examples of the applicability of the algorithm. This procedure cannot be applied to every poset, but it is exact when it can be used. Moreover, the method is quick and easy to implement. Besides, it allows a simple way to derive the number of linear extensions of a given poset.","P. García-Segador1 & P. Miranda

0,Empirical Measure and Small Noise Asymptotics Under Large Deviation Scaling for Interacting Diffusions,"Consider a collection of particles whose state evolution is described through a system of interacting diffusions in which each particle is driven by an independent individual source of noise and also by a small amount of noise that is common to all particles. The interaction between the particles is due to the common noise and also through the drift and diffusion coefficients that depend on the state empirical measure. We study large deviation behavior of the empirical measure process which is governed by two types of scaling, one corresponding to mean field asymptotics and the other to the Freidlin–Wentzell small noise asymptotics. Different levels of intensity of the small common noise lead to different types of large deviation behavior, and we provide a precise characterization of the various regimes. The rate functions can be interpreted as the value functions of certain stochastic control problems in which there are two types of controls; one of the controls is random and nonanticipative and arises from the aggregated contributions of the individual Brownian noises, whereas the second control is nonrandom and corresponds to the small common Brownian noise that impacts all particles. We also study large deviation behavior of interacting particle systems approximating various types of Feynman–Kac functionals.

0,Modeling of chromosome intermingling by partially overlapping uniform random polygons,"During the early phase of the cell cycle the eukaryotic genome is organized into chromosome territories. The geometry of the interface between any two chromosomes remains a matter of debate and may have important functional consequences. The Interchromosomal Network model (introduced by Branco and Pombo) proposes that territories intermingle along their periphery. In order to partially quantify this concept we here investigate the probability that two chromosomes form an unsplittable link. We use the uniform random polygon as a crude model for chromosome territories and we model the interchromosomal network as the common spatial region of two overlapping uniform random polygons. This simple model allows us to derive some rigorous mathematical results as well as to perform computer simulations easily. We find that the probability that one uniform random polygon of length n that partially overlaps a fixed polygon is bounded below by \({1-O(\frac{1}{\sqrt n})}\). We use numerical simulations to estimate the dependence of the linking probability of two uniform random polygons (of lengths n and m, respectively) on the amount of overlapping. The degree of overlapping is parametrized by a parameter \({\epsilon\in [0,1]}\) such that \({\epsilon=0}\) indicates no overlapping and \({\epsilon=1}\) indicates total overlapping. We propose that this dependence relation may be modeled as \({f(\varepsilon, m, n) =1-{\frac{a(\epsilon)}{b(\epsilon)\sqrt{mn}+c(\epsilon)}}}\). Numerical evidence shows that this model works well when \({\epsilon}\) is relatively large \({(\varepsilon \ge 0.5)}\). We then use these results to model the data published by Branco and Pombo and observe that for the amount of overlapping observed experimentally the URPs have a non-zero probability of forming an unsplittable link.","T.

0,Multiplier Stabilization Applied to Two-Stage Stochastic Programs,"In many mathematical optimization applications, dual variables are an important output of the solving process, due to their role as price signals. When dual solutions are not unique, different solvers or different computers, even different runs in the same computer if the problem is stochastic, often end up with different optimal multipliers. From the perspective of a decision maker, this variability makes the price signals less reliable and, hence, less useful. We address this issue for a particular family of linear and quadratic programs by proposing a solution procedure that, among all possible optimal multipliers, systematically yields the one with the smallest norm. The approach, based on penalization techniques of nonlinear programming, amounts to a regularization in the dual of the original problem. As the penalty parameter tends to zero, convergence of the primal sequence and, more critically, of the dual is shown under natural assumptions. The methodology is illustrated on a battery of two-stage stochastic linear programs.","Clara Lage1,2, Claudia Sagastizábal

0,A reinforcement-learning approach for admission control in distributed network service systems,"In the distributed network service systems such as streaming-media systems and resource-sharing systems with multiple service nodes, admission control (AC) technology is an essential way to enhance performance. Model-based optimization approaches are good ways to be applied to analyze and solve the optimal AC policy. However, due to “the curse of dimensionality”, computing such policy for practical systems is a rather difficult task. In this paper, we consider a general model of the distributed network service systems, and address the problem of designing an optimal AC policy. An analytical model is presented for the system with fixed parameters based on semi-Markov decision process (SMDP). We design an event-driven AC policy, and the stationary randomized policy is taken as the policy structure. To solve the SMDP, both the state aggregation approach and the reinforcement-learning (RL) method with online policy optimization algorithm are applied. Then, we extend the problem by considering the system with time-varying parameters, where the arrival rates of requests at each service node may change over time. In view of this situation, an AC policy switching mechanism is presented. This mechanism allows the system to decide whether to adjust its AC policy according to the policy switching rule. And in order to maximize the gain of system, that is, to obtain the optimal AC policy switching rule, another RL-based algorithm is applied. To assess the effectiveness of SMDP-based AC policy and policy switching mechanism for the system, numerical experiments are presented. We compare the performance of optimal policies obtained by the solutions of proposed methods with other classical AC policies. The simulation results illustrate that higher performance and computational efficiency could be achieved by using the SMDP model and RL-based algorithms proposed in this paper.","Xiaonong Lu1, Baoqun Yin1 & Haipeng Zhang",Journal of Combinatorial Optimization,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10878-014-9820-3,"Distributed network service system,Admission control ,SMDP,Reinforcement-learning,Policy switching mechanism"

For some Markov chains, it is infeasible to obtain the explicit expressions of their corresponding finite-dimensional distributions and sometimes it is time-consuming for computation. In this paper, we propose an approximation method for Markov chains by applying the copula theory. For this purpose, we first discuss the checkerboard copula-based Markov chain, which is the Markov chain generated by the family of checkerboard copulas. This Markov chain has some appealing properties, such as self-similarity in copulas and having explicit forms of finite-dimensional distributions. Then we prove that each Markov chain can be approximated by a sequence of checkerboard copula-based Markov chains, and the error bounds of the approximate distributions are provided. Employing the checkerboard copula-based approximation method, we propose a sufficient condition for the geometric β-mixing of copula-based Markov chains. This condition allows copulas of Markov chains to be asymmetric. Finally, by applying the approximation method, analytical recurrence formulas are also derived for computing approximate distributions of both the first passage time and the occupation time of a Markov chain, and numerical results are listed to show the approximation errors.","Zhengyong Zhou1, Jiehua Xie2 & Jingping Yang1,",Science China Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-019-1687-2,"Markov chain,copula,checkerboard copula-based Markov chain,

Three time-scales arise for these models: (i) the fast neuronal dynamics, (ii) the intermediate external input to the system, and (iii) the slow learning mechanisms. Based on this time-scale separation, we apply an extension of the mathematical theory of stochastic averaging with periodic forcing in order to derive a reduced deterministic model for the connectivity dynamics. We focus on a class of models where the activity is linear to understand the specificity of several learning rules (Hebbian, trace or anti-symmetric learning). In a weakly connected regime, we study the equilibrium connectivity which gathers the entire ‘knowledge’ of the network about the inputs. We develop an asymptotic method to approximate this equilibrium. We show that the symmetric part of the connectivity post-learning encodes the correlation structure of the inputs, whereas the anti-symmetric part corresponds to the cross correlation between the inputs and their time derivative. Moreover, the time-scales ratio appears as an important parameter revealing temporal correlations.","Mathieu Galtier1,2 & Gilles Wainrib",The Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2190-8567-2-13,"slow-fast systems,stochastic differential equations,inhomogeneous Markov process,averaging,model reduction,recurrent networks,unsupervised learning,Hebbian learning,STDP"
0,On Randomized Trace Estimates for Indefinite Matrices with an Application to Determinants,"Randomized trace estimation is a popular and well-studied technique that approximates the trace of a large-scale matrix B by computing the average of \(x^T Bx\) for many samples of a random vector X. Often, B is symmetric positive definite (SPD) but a number of applications give rise to indefinite B. Most notably, this is the case for log-determinant estimation, a task that features prominently in statistical learning, for instance in maximum likelihood estimation for Gaussian process regression. The analysis of randomized trace estimates, including tail bounds, has mostly focused on the SPD case. In this work, we derive new tail bounds for randomized trace estimates applied to indefinite B with Rademacher or Gaussian random vectors.

0,Kinetic models with non-local sensing determining cell polarization and speed according to independent cues,"Cells move by run and tumble, a kind of dynamics in which the cell alternates runs over straight lines and re-orientations. This erratic motion may be influenced by external factors, like chemicals, nutrients, the extra-cellular matrix, in the sense that the cell measures the external field and elaborates the signal eventually adapting its dynamics. We propose a kinetic transport equation implementing a velocity-jump process in which the transition probability takes into account a double bias, which acts, respectively, on the choice of the direction of motion and of the speed. The double bias depends on two different non-local sensing cues coming from the external environment. We analyze how the size of the cell and the way of sensing the environment with respect to the variation of the external fields affect the cell population dynamics by recovering an appropriate macroscopic limit and directly integrating the kinetic transport equation. A comparison between the solutions of the transport equation and of the proper macroscopic limit is also performed.","Nadia Loy1,2 & Luigi Preziosi

0,Sequential decision aggregation with social pressure,"This paper proposes and characterizes a sequential decision aggregation system consisting of agents performing binary sequential hypothesis testing and a fusion center which collects the individual decisions and reaches the global decision according to some threshold rule. Individual decision makers’ behaviors in the system are influenced by other decision makers, through a model for social pressure; our notion of social pressure is proportional to the ratio of individual decision makers who have already made the decisions. For our proposed model, we obtain the following results: First, we derive a recursive expression for the probabilities of making the correct and wrong global decisions as a function of time, system size, and the global decision threshold. The expression is based on the individual decision makers’ decision probabilities and does not rely on the specific individual decision-making policy. Second, we discuss two specific threshold rules: the fastest rule and the majority rule. By means of a mean-field analysis, we relate the asymptotic performance of the fusion center, as the system size tends to infinity, to the individual decision makers’ decision probability sequence. In addition to theoretical analysis, simulation work is conducted to discuss the speed/accuracy tradeoffs for different threshold rules.","Wenjun Mei

The stochastic model assumes there is demographic variability. The dynamics of the deterministic model are summarized. Then the dynamics of the stochastic model are compared to the deterministic model. In the deterministic model, there can be either disease extinction, competitive exclusion, where only one strain persists, or coexistence, where more than one strain persists. In the stochastic model, all strains are eventually eliminated because the disease-free state is an absorbing state. However, if the population size and the initial number of infected individuals are sufficiently large, it may take a long time until all strains are eliminated. Numerical simulations of the stochastic model show that coexistence cases predicted by the deterministic model are an unlikely occurrence in the stochastic model even for short time periods. In the stochastic model, either disease extinction or competitive exclusion occur. The initial number of infected individuals, the basic reproduction numbers, and other epidemiological parameters are important determinants of the dominant strain in the stochastic epidemic model.",Nadarajah Kirupaharan1 & Linda J.

We show that this framework incorporates both earlier population models, like the Ricker and Hassell models, and experimental observations concerning the structure of density dependence. The two fundamental premises of population dynamics are sufficient to guarantee that the model will exhibit chaotic behaviour for high values of the natural growth and the density-dependent feedback, and this observation is independent of the particular structure of the model. We also study these models when the environment of the population varies stochastically and address the question under what conditions we can find an invariant probability distribution for the population under consideration. The sufficient conditions for this stochastic stability that we derive are of some interest, since studying certain statistical characteristics of these stochastic population processes may only be possible if the process converges to such an invariant distribution.",M.

In each iteration it generates a candidate successor point by generating a uniformly distributed point along a direction chosen at random from the current iteration point. In contrast to the discrete case, a single step of this algorithm may generateany point in the feasible region as a candidate point. The candidate point is then accepted as the next iteration point according to the Metropolis criterion parametrized by anadaptive cooling schedule. Again in contrast to discrete simulated annealing, the sequence of iteration points converges in probability to a global optimum regardless of how rapidly the temperatures converge to zero.

0,Metastable evolutionary dynamics: Crossing fitness barriers or escaping via neutral paths?,"We analytically study the dynamics of evolving populations that exhibit metastability on the level of phenotype or fitness. In constant selective environments, such metastable behavior is caused by two qualitatively different mechanisms. On the one hand, populations may become pinned at a local fitness optimum, being separated from higher-fitness genotypes by a fitness barrier of low-fitness genotypes. On the other hand, the population may only be metastable on the level of phenotype or fitness while, at the same time, diffusing over neutral networks of selectively neutral genotypes. Metastability occurs in this case because the population is separated from higher-fitness genotypes by an entropy barrier: the population must explore large portions of these neutral networks before it discovers a rare connection to fitter phenotypes.We derive analytical expressions for the barrier crossing times in both the fitness barrier and entropy barrier regime. In contrast with ‘landscape’ evolutionary models, we show that the waiting times to reach higher fitness depend strongly on the width of a fitness barrier and much less on its height. The analysis further shows that crossing entropy barriers is faster by orders of magnitude than fitness barrier crossing. Thus, when populations are trapped in a metastable phenotypic state, they are most likely to escape by crossing an entropy barrier, along a neutral path in genotype space. If no such escape route along a neutral path exists, a population is most likely to cross a fitness barrier where the barrier is narrowest, rather than where the barrier is shallowest.","Erik van Nimwegen1,2 & James P.

0,Generalized negative binomial distributions as mixed geometric laws and related limit theorems*,"In this paper, we study a wide and flexible family of discrete distributions, the so-called generalized negative binomial (GNB) distributions, which are mixed Poisson distributions with the mixing laws belonging to the class of generalized gamma (GG) distributions. This family was introduced by E.W. Stacy as a particular family of lifetime distributions containing gamma, exponential power, and Weibull distributions. These distributions seem to be very promising in the statistical description of many real phenomena and very convenient and almost universal models for the description of statistical regularities in discrete data. We study analytic properties of GNB distributions. We prove that a GG distribution is a mixed exponential distribution if and only if the shape and exponent power parameters are no greater than one. We write the mixing distribution explicitly as a scale mixture of strictly stable laws concentrated on the nonnegative half-line. As a corollary, we obtain a representation for the GNB distribution as a mixed geometric distribution. We consider the corresponding scheme of Bernoulli trials with random probability of success. Within this scheme, we prove a random analog of the Poisson theorem establishing the convergence of mixed binomial distributions to mixed Poisson laws. We prove limit theorems for random sums of independent random variables in which the number of summands has the GNB distribution and the summands have both light- and heavy-tailed distributions. We obtain that the class of limit laws is wide enough and includes the so-called generalized variance gamma distributions. We obtain various representations for the limit laws in terms of mixtures of Mittag-Leffler, Linnik, or Laplace distributions. We prove limit theorems establishing the convergence of the distributions of statistics constructed from samples with random sizes obeying the GNB distribution to generalized variance gamma distributions.

In this paper, we investigate fixation probability, mean effective fixation time, and average and expected fitnesses in the diffusion approximation of the stochastic evolutionary game. Our main results show that in two-strategy games with strict Nash equilibria A and B: (i) the one-third law means that, if selection favors strategy A when a single individual is using it initially, then one-third of the opponents one meets before fixation are A-individuals; and (ii) the average fitness of strategy A about the mean effective fixation time is larger than that of strategy B. The analysis reinforces the universal nature of the one-third law as of fundamental importance in models of selection.

Moreover, the authors consider the correlation between the claim process and the price process of the risky asset.

Then with the optimal reinsurance strategy chosen by the insurer, the authors consider two optimization problems for the reinsurer: The problem of maximizing the expected exponential utility of terminal wealth and the problem of minimizing the ruin probability.

Under various vaccine action models, we consider both household-based vaccination schemes, in which the way in which individuals are chosen for vaccination depends on the size of the households in which they reside, and acquaintance vaccination, which targets individuals of high degree in the social network. For both types of vaccination scheme, assuming a large population with few initial infectives, we derive a threshold parameter which determines whether or not a large outbreak can occur and also the probability of a large outbreak and the fraction of the population infected by a large outbreak. The performance of these schemes is studied numerically, focusing on the influence of the household size distribution and the degree distribution of the social network. We find that acquaintance vaccination can significantly outperform the best household-based scheme if the degree distribution of the social network is heavy-tailed. For household-based schemes, when the vaccine coverage is insufficient to prevent a major outbreak and the vaccine is imperfect, we find situations in which both the probability and size of a major outbreak under the scheme which minimises the threshold parameter are larger than in the scheme which maximises the threshold parameter.","Frank Ball

0,Mechanical-Statistical Modeling in Ecology: From Outbreak Detections to Pest Dynamics,"Knowledge about large-scale and long-term dynamics of (natural) populations is required to assess the efficiency of control strategies, the potential for long-term persistence, and the adaptability to global changes such as habitat fragmentation and global warming. For most natural populations, such as pest populations, large-scale and long-term surveys cannot be carried out at a high resolution. For instance, for population dynamics characterized by irregular abundance explosions, i.e., outbreaks, it is common to report detected outbreaks rather than measuring the population density at every location and time event. Here, we propose a mechanical-statistical model for analyzing such outbreak occurrence data and making inference about population dynamics. This spatio-temporal model contains the main mechanisms of the dynamics and describes the observation process. This construction enables us to account for the discrepancy between the phenomenon scale and the sampling scale. We propose the Bayesian method to estimate model parameters, pest densities and hidden factors, i.e., variables involved in the dynamics but not observed. The model was specified and used to learn about the dynamics of the European pine sawfly (Neodiprion sertifer Geoffr., an insect causing major defoliation of pines in northern Europe) based on Finnish sawfly data covering the years 1961–1990. In this application, a dynamical Beverton–Holt model including a hidden regime variable was incorporated into the model to deal with large variations in the population densities. Our results gave support to the idea that pine sawfly dynamics should be studied as metapopulations with alternative equilibria. The results confirmed the importance of extreme minimum winter temperatures for the occurrence of European pine sawfly outbreaks. The strong positive connection between the ratio of lake area over total area and outbreaks was quantified for the first time.","S. Soubeyrand1,2, S. Neuvonen3 & A.

0,A new equivalent transformation for interval inequality constraints of interval linear programming,"In this paper, we have introduced a new approach to solve a class of interval linear programming (ILP) problems. Firstly, the novel concept of an interval ordering relation is further developed to make desired solution feasible. Secondly, according to the 3\(\upsigma \) law of normal distribution, a new equivalent transformation for constraints with the interval-valued coefficients of ILP is justified. Accordingly, the uncertainty stemmed from interval number could be replaced by the uncertainty of random variables. Consequently, the classical methodology of stochastic linear programming, a chance constrained programming model based on normal distribution is designed to work out the equivalent form of the original problem. This is because it allows us to carry out the optimization operation with a certain calibrated probability. A typical numerical example is given to illustrate how to apply equivalent transformation in order to realize ILP. Finally, we conclude this paper by elaborated comparisons among our method and selected existing solutions to advance our confidence of our research results as to their correctness and effectiveness.","Mingzhi Chen1, Sheng-Guo Wang2, Paul P.

0,Efficient uncertainty quantification of a fully nonlinear and dispersive water wave model with random inputs,"A major challenge in next-generation industrial applications is to improve numerical analysis by quantifying uncertainties in predictions. In this work we present a formulation of a fully nonlinear and dispersive potential flow water wave model with random inputs for the probabilistic description of the evolution of waves. The model is analyzed using random sampling techniques and nonintrusive methods based on generalized polynomial chaos (PC). These methods allow us to accurately and efficiently estimate the probability distribution of the solution and require only the computation of the solution at different points in the parameter space, allowing for the reuse of existing simulation software. The choice of the applied methods is driven by the number of uncertain input parameters and by the fact that finding the solution of the considered model is computationally intensive. We revisit experimental benchmarks often used for validation of deterministic water wave models. Based on numerical experiments and assumed uncertainties in boundary data, our analysis reveals that some of the known discrepancies from deterministic simulation in comparison with experimental measurements could be partially explained by the variability in the model input. Finally, we present a synthetic experiment studying the variance-based sensitivity of the wave load on an offshore structure to a number of input uncertainties. In the numerical examples presented the PC methods exhibit fast convergence, suggesting that the problem is amenable to analysis using such methods.","Daniele Bigoni

The kind of RBM studied here behaves like d-dimensional Brownian motion with constant drift μ in the interior of a simple polyhedron and is instantaneously reflected at the boundary in directions that depend on the face that is hit. Under the assumption that the directions of reflection satisfy a certain skew symmetry condition first introduced in Harrison-Williams [9], it is shown that such an RBM can be characterized in terms of a family of submartingales and that it reaches non-smooth parts of the boundary with probability zero. In [9], a purely analytic problem associated with such an RBM was solved. Here the exponential form solution obtained in [9] is shown to be the density of an invariant measure for the RBM. Furthermore, if the density is integrable over the polyhedral state space, then it yields the unique stationary distribution for the RBM. In the proofs of these results, a key role is played by a dual process for the RBM and by results in [9] for reflected Brownian motions on smooth approximating domains.",R. J.

0,A robust optimization approach to experimental design for model discrimination of dynamical systems,"A high-ranking goal of interdisciplinary modeling approaches in science and engineering are quantitative prediction of system dynamics and model based optimization. Quantitative modeling has to be closely related to experimental investigations if the model is supposed to be used for mechanistic analysis and model predictions. Typically, before an appropriate model of an experimental system is found different hypothetical models might be reasonable and consistent with previous knowledge and available data. The parameters of the models up to an estimated confidence region are generally not known a priori. Therefore one has to incorporate possible parameter configurations of different models into a model discrimination algorithm which leads to the need for robustification. In this article we present a numerical algorithm which calculates a design of experiments allowing optimal discrimination of different hypothetic candidate models of a given dynamical system for the most inappropriate (worst case) parameter configurations within a parameter range. The design comprises initial values, system perturbations and the optimal placement of measurement time points, the number of measurements as well as the time points are subject to design. The statistical discrimination criterion is worked out rigorously for these settings, a derivation from the Kullback-Leibler divergence as optimization objective is presented for the case of discontinuous Heaviside-functions modeling the measurement decision which are replaced by continuous approximations during the optimization procedure.

0,Solvency of an Insurance Company in a Dual Risk Model with Investment: Analysis and Numerical Study of Singular Boundary Value Problems,"AbstractThe survival probability of an insurance company in a collective pension insurance model (so-called dual risk model) is investigated in the case when the whole surplus (or its fixed fraction) is invested in risky assets, which are modeled by a geometric Brownian motion. A typical insurance contract for an insurer in this model is a life annuity in exchange for the transfer of the inheritance right to policyholder’s property to the insurance company. The model is treated as dual with respect to the Cramér–Lundberg classical model. In the structure of an insurance risk process, this is expressed by positive random jumps (compound Poisson process) and a linearly decreasing deterministic component corresponding to pension payments. In the case of exponentially distributed jump sizes, it is shown that the survival probability regarded as a function of initial surplus defined on the nonnegative real half-line is a solution of a singular boundary value problem for an integro-differential equation with a non-Volterra integral operator. The existence and uniqueness of a solution to this problem is proved. Asymptotic representations of the survival probability for small and large values of the initial surplus are obtained. An efficient algorithm for the numerical evaluation of the solution is proposed. Numerical results are presented, and their economic interpretation is given. Namely, it is shown that, in pension insurance, investment in risky assets plays an important role in an increase of the company’s solvency for small values of initial surplus.","T. A. Belkina1, N.

The dependence information needed in this probing process consist of “Boolean” Jacobian-vector products and possibly also vector-Jacobian products, which can be evaluated exactly by automatic differentiation or approximated by divided differences. The latter approach yields correct sparsity patterns, provided there is no exact cancellation at the current argument.¶Starting from a user specified, or by default initialized, probability distribution the procedure suggests a sequence of probing vectors. The resulting information is then used to update the probabilities that certain elements are nonzero according to Bayes’ law. The proposed probing procedure is found to require only O(logn) probing vectors on randomly generated matrices of dimension n, with a fixed number of nonzeros per row or column. This result has been proven for (block-) banded matrices, and for general sparsity pattern finite termination of the probing procedure can be guaranteed.",Andreas Griewank1 & Christo Mitev,Mathematical Programming,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s101070100281,Key words: sparsity – automatic differentiation – difference quotients – conditional probability

In this way we extend results by Costa and Dufour (J. Appl. Probab. 43:767–781, 2006). As a consequence we obtain an integral decomposition of every invariant probability measure in terms of the ergodic probability measures. Our approach is completely centered around the reduction to and relationship with the case of a single regular Markov operator associated to the Markov semigroup, the resolvent operator, which enables us to fully exploit results in that situation (Worm and Hille in Ergod.

0,Noise reduction in chaotic time series using scaled probabilistic methods,"We present a probabilistic approach to the problem of additive source separation characterized by wide band power spectra when one of the sources is deterministic and low-dimensional (regular or chaotic). The algorithm is based upon a probabilistic analysis of local behavior in the phase space in which the deterministic source is embedded. It creates a kind of time domain “filter” for the noisy data from areference orbit of the system, and it then corrects the observed noisy data in an incremental fashion to adjust it to match this filter in the sense of having as close as possible the same invariant distribution in the phase space. After describing the general method, we demonstrate its use on three familiar chaotic systems: first, two examples of chaotic maps (Hénon and Ikeda) in two dimensions and then a three-dimensional flow (the Lorenz system). The data from each of these is perturbed by uniformly distributed noise or by a spike signal, and we show that the method gives excellent results in recovering the original clean signal even when noise levels are quite large. Our present method appears to work even when the signal-to-noise ratio is quite small. The method works in cases where classical linear methods fail because both “signal,” and “noise,” are broadband spectrally.","P. F. Marteau1 & H. D. I.

RAF (reflexively autocatalytic and food-generated) theory provides a formal way to study such processes. Beginning with Kauffman’s notion of “collectively autocatalytic sets,” this theory has been further developed over the last decade with the discovery of efficient algorithms and new mathematical analysis. In this paper, we study how the behaviour of a simple binary polymer model can be extended to models where the pattern of catalysis more precisely reflects the ligation and cleavage reactions involved. We find that certain properties of these models are similar to, and can be accurately predicted from, the simple binary polymer model; however, other properties lead to slightly different estimates.

0,Adaptive and multi-mining versions of the DM-GRASP hybrid metaheuristic,"Metaheuristics represent an important class of techniques to solve, approximately, hard combinatorial optimization problems for which the use of exact methods is impractical. Some researches have been combining machine learning techniques with metaheuristics to adaptively guide and improve the search for near optimal solutions. An example of such development is the DM-GRASP, a hybrid version of the Greedy Randomized Adaptative Search Procedures (GRASP) metaheuristic which incorporates a data mining process. In this hybrid proposal, after executing half of the total number of iterations, the data mining process extracts patterns from an elite set of sub-optimal solutions for the optimization problem. These patterns present characteristics of near optimal solutions and can be used to guide the following half GRASP iterations in the search through the solution space. In this work, we explore new versions of the DM-GRASP metaheuristic to experiment, not a single activation, but multiple and adaptive executions of the data mining process during the metaheuristic execution. We also applied the data mining technique into a reactive GRASP to show that a more sophisticated and not memoryless GRASP approach can also benefit from the use of this technique. In order to evaluate these new proposals, we adopted the server replication for reliable multicast problem since the best known results for this problem were obtained by GRASP and DM-GRASP implementations. The computational experiments, comparing traditional GRASP, DM-GRASP, and the new proposals, showed that multiple and adaptive executions of the data mining process can improve the results obtained by the DM-GRASP hybrid metaheuristic—the new proposals were able to find better results in less computational time for the reliable multicast problem.","Alexandre Plastino1, Hugo Barbalho1, Luis Filipe M.

A model is presented to maximize the probability of all constraints, while not exceeding a certain amount. We assume that the rows of the constraint matrix are dependent, so we use a marginal distribution of the Copula functions, instead of the distribution functions and the dependency is driven by an appropriate Archimedean Copula. Then, we transform the joint chance-constrained problems into deterministic problems of second-order cone programming. This is a new approach where considers the dependency between resource consumptions and connects Copulas to stochastic resource constrained shortest path problem (SRCSPP). The results indicate that the effect of marginal probability levels is considerable. Moreover, the linear relaxation of SRCSPP is generally not convex; thus we can use lower and upper bounds of the second-order cone programming approximation to solve the relaxation problem. The experimental results show that the SRCSPP with Copula theory can achieve efficient performance.","Zohreh Hosseini Nodeh1, Ali Babapour Azar1, Rashed Khanjani Shiraz1, Salman Khodayifar2 & …Panos M.

0,A new data envelopment analysis model with fuzzy random inputs and outputs,"This paper first presents several formulas for mean chance distributions of triangular fuzzy random variables and their functions, then develops a new class of fuzzy random data envelopment analysis (FRDEA) models with mean chance constraints, in which the inputs and outputs are assumed to be characterized by fuzzy random variables with known possibility and probability distributions. According to the established formulas for the mean chance distributions, we can turn the mean chance constraints into their equivalent stochastic ones. On the other hand, since the objective in the FRDEA model is the expectation about the ratio of the weighted sum of outputs and the weighted sum of inputs for a target decision-making unite (DMU), for general fuzzy random inputs and outputs, we suggest an approximation method to evaluate the objective; and for triangular fuzzy random inputs and outputs, we propose a method to reduce the objective to its equivalent stochastic one. As a consequence, under the assumption that the inputs and the outputs are triangular fuzzy random vectors, the proposed FRDEA model can be reduced to its equivalent stochastic programming one, in which the constraints contain the standard normal distribution function, and the objective is the expectation for a function of the normal random variable. To solve the equivalent stochastic programming model, we design a hybrid algorithm by integrating stochastic simulation and genetic algorithm (GA).

The main result of the paper shows that a proof in arithmetic with the random substitution rule can be considerably shorter than an arithmetical proof of the same formula. Namely, there exists a set of formulas such that (i) these formulas are provable in arithmetic but, unless PSPACE=NP, do not have polynomially long proofs; (ii) these proofs have polynomially long proofs in arithmetic with random substitution (whatever random numbers appear) and the probability of error of these proofs is exponentially small.

We provide sufficient general assumptions that guarantee existence, uniqueness, and Pareto optimality of such a SORTE. In both the Bühlmann and the SORTE definition, each agent is behaving rationally by maximizing his/her expected utility given a budget constraint. The two approaches differ by the budget constraints. In Bühlmann’s definition the vector that assigns the budget constraint is given a priori. On the contrary, in the SORTE approach, the vector that assigns the budget constraint is endogenously determined by solving a systemic utility maximization. SORTE gives priority to the systemic aspects of the problem, in order to optimize the overall systemic performance, rather than to individual rationality.","Francesca Biagini1, Alessandro Doldi2, Jean-Pierre Fouque3, Marco Frittelli

0,Mixing time for random walk on supercritical dynamical percolation,"We consider dynamical percolation on the d-dimensional discrete torus \({\mathbb {Z}}_n^d\) of side length n, where each edge refreshes its status at rate \(\mu =\mu _n\le 1/2\) to be open with probability p. We study random walk on the torus, where the walker moves at rate 1 / (2d) along each open edge. In earlier work of two of the authors with A. Stauffer, it was shown that in the subcritical case \(p<p_c({\mathbb {Z}}^d)\), the (annealed) mixing time of the walk is \(\Theta (n^2/\mu )\), and it was conjectured that in the supercritical case \(p>p_c({\mathbb {Z}}^d)\), the mixing time is \(\Theta (n^2+1/\mu )\); here the implied constants depend only on d and p. We prove a quenched (and hence annealed) version of this conjecture up to a poly-logarithmic factor under the assumption \(\theta (p)>1/2\). When \(\theta (p)>0\), we prove a version of this conjecture for an alternative notion of mixing time involving randomised stopping times. The latter implies sharp (up to poly-logarithmic factors) upper bounds on exit times of large balls throughout the supercritical regime. Our proofs are based on percolation results (e.g., the Grimmett–Marstrand Theorem) and an analysis of the volume-biased evolving set process; the key point is that typically, the evolving set has a substantial intersection with the giant percolation cluster at many times. This allows us to use precise isoperimetric properties of the cluster (due to G. Pete) to infer rapid growth of the evolving set, which in turn yields the upper bound on the mixing time.

0,Improved Bounds for Acyclic Job Shop Scheduling,"In acyclic job shop scheduling problems there are n jobs and m machines. Each job is composed of a sequence of operations to be performed on different machines. A legal schedule is one in which within each job, operations are carried out in order, and each machine performs at most one operation in any unit of time. If D denotes the length of the longest job, and C denotes the number of time units requested by all jobs on the most loaded machine, then clearly lb = max[C,D] is a lower bound on the length of the shortest legal schedule. A celebrated result of Leighton, Maggs, and Rao shows that if all operations are of unit length, then there always is a legal schedule of length O(lb), independent of n and m. For the case that operations may have different lengths, Shmoys, Stein and Wein showed that there always is a legal schedule of length , where the  notation is used to suppress  terms. We improve the upper bound to . We also show that our new upper bound is essentially best possible, by proving the existence of instances of acyclic job shop scheduling for which the shortest legal schedule is of length .

For the multivariate Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic, we show the error of bootstrap approximation is as small as that of the Gaussian approximation.

The model was initially defined on the cubic lattices ℤd, but the only case where the value of some critical exponent has been established so far is the case of the infinite regular tree—the Bethe lattice.This paper is devoted to the study of the abelian sandpile model on a large class of graphs that serve as approximations to Julia sets of postcritically finite polynomials and occur naturally in the study of automorphism group actions on infinite rooted trees. While different from the square lattice, these graphs share many of its geometric properties: they are of polynomial growth, have one end, and random walks on them are recurrent. This ensures that the behaviour of sandpiles on them is quite different from that observed on the infinite tree. We compute the critical exponent for the decay of mass of sand avalanches on these graphs and prove that it is inversely proportional to the rate of polynomial growth of the graph, thus providing the first rigorous derivation of the critical exponent different from the mean-field (the tree) value.",M.

A specific micromovement model built upon linear Brownian motion with jumping stochastic volatility is used to demonstrate the procedure to develop a micromovement model with specific tick-level sample characteristics. The model is further used to demonstrate the procedure to implement Bayes estimation via filtering, namely, to construct a recursive algorithm for computing the trade-by-trade Bayes parameter estimates, especially for the stochastic volatility.

The prediction process is one of tree creation. The value function for the last step uses some of the classic heuristic decision methods.

We illustrate the utility of this approach by proving a general inequality expressing the subadditivity property of the entropy on \({\mathbb {R}^n}\), and fully determining the cases of equality. As a consequence of the duality mentioned above, we obtain a simple new proof of the classical Brascamp–Lieb inequality, and also a fully explicit determination of all of the cases of equality. We also deduce several other consequences of the general subadditivity inequality, including a generalization of Hadamard’s inequality for determinants. Finally, we also prove a second duality theorem relating superadditivity of the Fisher information and a sharp convolution type inequality for the fundamental eigenvalues of Schrödinger operators.

Our motivation is for use in non-smooth non-convex stochastic optimization problems, which are frequently encountered in applications such as machine learning.

From this result, a method with non-asymptotic convergence with high probability, as well as a method with asymptotic convergence to a Clarke stationary point almost surely are developed.

They may be at the origin of the fixation of a new genotype, if they give a phenotypic advantage to the carriers of the new mutation. In this paper, we are interested in the genetic signature left by a selective sweep induced by recurrent mutations at a given locus from an allele \(A\) to an allele \(a\), depending on the mutation frequency. We distinguish three possible scales for the mutation probability per reproductive event, which entail distinct genetic signatures. Besides, we study the hydrodynamic limit of the \(A\)- and \(a\)-population size dynamics when mutations are frequent, and find non trivial equilibria leading to several possible patterns of polymorphism.","Charline Smadi1,",Acta Applicandae Mathematicae,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10440-016-0086-x,"Eco-evolution,Birth and death process with immigration,Selective sweep,Coupling,Competitive Lotka-Volterra system with mutations"

0,Optimal portfolio strategies with a liability and random risk: The case of different lending and borrowing rates,"This paper deals with two problems of optimal portfolio strategies in continuous time. The first one studies the optimal behavior of a firm who is forced to withdraw funds continuously at a fixed rate per unit time. The second one considers a firm that is faced with an uncontrollable stochastic cash flow, or random risk process. We assume the firm’s income can be obtained only from the investment in two assets: a risky asset (e.g., stock) and a riskless asset (e.g., bond). Therefore, the firm’s wealth follows a stochastic process. When the wealth is lower than certain legal level, the firm goes bankrupt. Thus how to invest in the fundamental problem of the firm in order to avoid bankruptcy. Under the case of different lending and borrowing rates, we obtain the optimal portfolio strategies for some reasonable objective functions that are the piecewise linear functions of the firm’s current wealth and present some interesting proofs for the conclusions. The optimal policies are easy to be operated for any relevant investor.",Zhaojun Yang1 & Lihong Huang,Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computing,2004,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02935749,"90A09,60H10"
0,A stochastic Farris transform for genetic data under the multispecies coalescent with applications to data requirements,"Species tree estimation faces many significant hurdles. Chief among them is that the trees describing the ancestral lineages of each individual gene—the gene trees—often differ from the species tree. The multispecies coalescent is commonly used to model this gene tree discordance, at least when it is believed to arise from incomplete lineage sorting, a population-genetic effect. Another significant challenge in this area is that molecular sequences associated to each gene typically provide limited information about the gene trees themselves. While the modeling of sequence evolution by single-site substitutions is well-studied, few species tree reconstruction methods with theoretical guarantees actually address this latter issue. Instead, a standard—but unsatisfactory—assumption is that gene trees are perfectly reconstructed before being fed into a so-called summary method. Hence much remains to be done in the development of inference methodologies that rigorously account for gene tree estimation error—or completely avoid gene tree estimation in the first place. In previous work, a data requirement trade-off was derived between the number of loci m needed for an accurate reconstruction and the length of the locus sequences k. It was shown that to reconstruct an internal branch of length f, one needs m to be of the order of \(1/[f^{2} \sqrt{k}]\). That previous result was obtained under the restrictive assumption that mutation rates as well as population sizes are constant across the species phylogeny. Here we further generalize this result beyond this assumption. Our main contribution is a novel reduction to the molecular clock case under the multispecies coalescent, which we refer to as a stochastic Farris transform. As a corollary, we also obtain a new identifiability result of independent interest: for any species tree with \(n \ge 3\) species, the rooted topology of the species tree can be identified from the distribution of its unrooted weighted gene trees even in the absence of a molecular clock.","Gautam Dasarathy1, Elchanan Mossel2, Robert Nowak3 & …Sebastien Roch

0,RNA secondary structures in a polymer-zeta model how foldings should be shaped for sparsification to establish a linear speedup,"Various tools used to predict the secondary structure for a given RNA sequence are based on dynamic programming used to compute a conformation of minimum free energy. For structures without pseudoknots, a worst-case runtime proportional to \(n^3\), with \(n\) being the length of the sequence, results since a table of dimension \(n^2\) has to be filled in while a single entry gives rise to a linear computational effort. However, it was recently observed that reformulating the corresponding dynamic programming recursion together with the bookkeeping of potential folding alternatives (a technique called sparsification) may reduce the runtime to \(n^2\) on average, assuming that nucleotides of distance \(d\) form a hydrogen bond (i.e. are paired) with probability \(\frac{b}{d^c}\) for some constants \(b>0,\,c>1\). The latter is called the polymer-zeta model and plays a crucial role in speeding up the above mentioned algorithm. In this paper we discuss the application of the polymer-zeta property for the analysis of sparsification, showing that it must be applied conditionally on first and last positions to pair. Afterwards, we will investigate the combinatorics of RNA secondary structures assuming that the corresponding conditional probabilities behave according to a polymer-zeta probability model. We show that even if some of the structural parameters exhibit an almost realistic behavior on average, the expected shape of a folding in that model must be assumed to highly differ from those observed in nature. More precisely, we prove our polymer-zeta model to be appropriate for mRNA molecules but to fail in connection with almost every other family of RNA. Those findings explain the huge speedup of the dynamic programming algorithm observed empirically by Wexler et al. when applying sparsification in connection with mRNA data.","Emma Yu Jin1 & Markus E.

0,A greedy memetic algorithm for a multiobjective dynamic bin packing problem for storing cooling objects,"In this paper, a multiobjective dynamic bin packing problem for storing cooling objects is introduced along with a metaheuristic designed to work well in mixed-variable environments. The dynamic bin packing problem is based on cookie production at a bakery, where cookies arrive in batches at a cooling rack with limited capacity and are packed into boxes with three competing goals. The first is to minimize the number of boxes used. The second objective is to minimize the average initial heat of each box, and the third is to minimize the maximum time until the boxes can be moved to the storefront. The metaheuristic developed here incorporated greedy heuristics into an adaptive evolutionary framework with partial decomposition into clusters of solutions for the crossover operator. The new metaheuristic was applied to a variety benchmark bin packing problems and to a small and large version of the dynamic bin packing problem. It performed as well as other metaheuristics in the benchmark problems and produced more diverse solutions in the dynamic problems. It performed better overall in the small dynamic problem, but its performance could not be proven to be better or worse in the large dynamic problem.","Kristina Yancey Spencer

Most of these algorithms search for the alignment of two sequences that optimizes some alignment score. It is an important problem to assess the statistical significance of a given score. In this paper we use newly developed methods for Poisson approximation to derive estimates of the statistical significance ofk-word matches on a diagonal of a sequence comparison. We require at leastq of thek letters of the words to match where 0<q≤k. The distribution of the number of matches on a diagonal is approximated as well as the distribution of the order statistics of the sizes of clumps of matches on the diagonal. These methods provide an easily computed approximation of the distribution of the longest exact matching word between sequences. The methods are validated using comparisons of vertebrate andE. coli protein sequences.

We derive for the first time a closed formula for the probability that the game has a certain number of internal equilibria, for both normal and uniform distributions of the game payoff entries. In addition, using Descartes’ rule of signs and combinatorial methods, we provide several universal upper and lower bound estimates for this probability, which are independent of the underlying payoff distribution.

We consider two types of connectivity requirements. We first study the problem of requiring an \(s\)-\(t\) path to exist with high probability in a directed graph. Then we consider undirected graphs, where we require the graph to be fully connected with high probability. We model each problem as a stochastic integer program with a joint chance constraint, and present two formulations that can be solved by a branch-and-cut algorithm. The first formulation uses binary variables to represent whether or not the connectivity requirement is satisfied in each scenario of arc failures and is based on inequalities derived from graph cuts in individual scenarios. We derive additional valid inequalities for this formulation and study their facet-inducing properties. The second formulation is based on probabilistic graph cuts, an extension of graph cuts to graphs with random arc failures. Inequalities corresponding to probabilistic graph cuts are sufficient to define the set of feasible solutions and violated inequalities in this class can be found efficiently at integer solutions, allowing this formulation to be solved by a branch-and-cut algorithm. Computational results demonstrate that the approaches can effectively solve instances on large graphs with many failure scenarios.

0,Non-parametric bootstrap tests for parametric distribution families,"Durbin’s estimated empirical process is a widely used tool to testing goodness of fit for parametric distribution families. In general, statistical methods based on the process are not distribution free and the critical values can not always be calculated in a theoretical way. One can avoid these difficulties by applying the parametric or the non-parametric bootstrap procedure. Although the parametric bootstrapped estimated empirical process is well investigated, only a few papers dealt with the non-parametric version. Recently, Babu and Rao pointed out that in the latter case a bias correction is needed, and they proved the weak convergence of the bootstrapped process in continuous distribution families. Our paper presents a weak approximation theorem for the non-parametric bootstrapped estimated empirical process using similar conditions under which Durbin’s non-bootstrapped process converges. The result covers the most important continuous and discrete distribution families. Simulation studies in the Poisson and the normal distribution are also reported.",Gábor Szűcs,Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03651319,"bootstrap,parametric estimation,empirical process,approximation,convergence in distribution"
0,Replication and mutation on neutral networks,"Folding of RNA sequences into secondary structures is viewed as a map that assigns a uniquely defined base pairing pattern to every sequence. The mapping is non-invertible since many sequences fold into the same minimum free energy (secondary) structure or shape. The pre-images of this map, called neutral networks, are uniquely associated with the shapes and vice versa. Random graph theory is used to construct networks in sequence space which are suitable models for neutral networks.The theory of molecular quasispecies has been applied to replication and mutation on single-peak fitness landscapes. This concept is extended by considering evolution on degenerate multi-peak landscapes which originate from neutral networks by assuming that one particular shape is fitter than all the others. On such a single-shape landscape the superior fitness value is assigned to all sequences belonging to the master shape. All other shapes are lumped together and their fitness values are averaged in a way that is reminiscent of mean field theory. Replication and mutation on neutral networks are modeled by phenomenological rate equations as well as by a stochastic birth-and-death model. In analogy to the error threshold in sequence space the phenotypic error threshold separates two scenarios: (i) a stationary (fittest) master shape surrounded by closely related shapes and (ii) populations drifting through shape space by a diffusion-like process. The error classes of the quasispecies model are replaced by distance classes between the master shape and the other structures.Analytical results are derived for single-shape landscapes, in particular, simple expressions are obtained for the mean fraction of master shapes in a population and for phenotypic error thresholds. The analytical results are complemented by data obtained from computer simulation of the underlying stochastic processes. The predictions of the phenomenological approach on the single-shape landscape are very well reproduced by replication and mutation kinetics of tRNAphe. Simulation of the stochastic process at a resolution of individual distance classes yields data which are in excellent agreement with the results derived from the birth-and-death model.","Christian Reidys2,3, Christian V.

0,PCPs via the low-degree long code and hardness for constrained hypergraph coloring,"We develop new techniques to incorporate the recently proposed “short code” (a low-degree version of the long code) into the construction and analysis of PCPs in the classical “label-cover + Fourier Analysis” framework. As a result, we obtain more size-efficient PCPs that yield improved hardness results for approximating CSPs and certain coloring-type problems.In particular, we show a hardness for a variant of hypergraph coloring (with hyperedges of size 6), with a gap between 2 and \(\exp ({2^{\Omega (\sqrt {\log \log N} )}})\) number of colors where N is the number of vertices. This is the first hardness result to go beyond the O(logN) barrier for a coloring-type problem. Our hardness bound is a doubly exponential improvement over the previously known O(log logN)-coloring hardness for 2-colorable hypergraphs, and an exponential improvement over the \({(\log N)^{\Omega (1)}}\)-coloring hardness for O(1)-colorable hypergraphs. Stated in terms of “covering complexity,” we show that for 6-ary Boolean CSPs, it is hard to decide if a given instance is perfectly satisfiable or if it requires more than \({2^{\Omega (\sqrt {\log \log N} )}}\) assignments for covering all of the constraints.While our methods do not yield a result for conventional hypergraph coloring due to some technical reasons, we also prove hardness of \({(\log N)^{\Omega (1)}}\)-coloring 2-colorable 8-uniform hypergraphs (this result relies just on the long code).A key algebraic result driving our analysis concerns a very low-soundness error testing method for Reed-Muller codes. We prove that if a function \(\beta :{\text{F}}_2^m \to {{\text{F}}_2}\) is \({2^{\Omega (d)}}\) far in absolute distance from polynomials of degree m − d, then the probability that deg(β

We consider a general class of hidden Markov models in continuous time with compact signal state space, and call such a model observable if no two initial measures of the signal process give rise to the same law of the observation process. We demonstrate that observability implies stability of the filter, i.e., the filtered estimates become insensitive to the initial measure at large times. For the special case where the signal is a finite-state Markov process and the observations are of the white noise type, a complete (necessary and sufficient) characterization of filter stability is obtained in terms of a slightly weaker detectability condition. In addition to observability, the role of controllability is explored. Finally, the results are partially extended to non-compact signal state spaces.",Ramon van Handel,Probability Theory and Related Fields,2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-008-0161-y,"Nonlinear filtering,Asymptotic stability,Observability,Detectability,Controllability,Hidden Markov models"

J Comput Phys, 2020) is not only a numerical method for interacting particle systems and its mean-field limit, but also can be viewed as a model of the particle system in which particles interact, at discrete time, with randomly selected mini-batch of particles. In this paper, we investigate the mean-field limit of this model as the number of particles N→∞. Unlike the classical mean field limit for interacting particle systems where the law of large numbers plays the role and the chaos is propagated to later times, the mean field limit now does not rely on the law of large numbers and chaos is imposed at every discrete time. Despite this, we will not only justify this mean-field limit (discrete in time) but will also show that the limit, as the discrete time interval τ → 0, approaches to the solution of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation arising as the mean-field limit of the original interacting particle system in the Wasserstein distance.",Shi Jin1 & Lei Li,Science China Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-020-1810-6,"Random Batch Method,mean field limit,chaos,Wasserstein distance,nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation"

We introduce a one-parameter family of random walks which interpolates between the original non-symmetric random walk and the symmetrized one. We first prove a semigroup CLT for the family of random walks by realizing the nilpotent covering graph into a nilpotent Lie group via discrete harmonic maps. The limiting diffusion semigroup is generated by the homogenized sub-Laplacian with a constant drift of the asymptotic direction on the nilpotent Lie group, which is equipped with the Albanese metric associated with the symmetrized random walk. We next prove a functional CLT (i.e., Donsker-type invariance principle) in a Hölder space over the nilpotent Lie group by combining the semigroup CLT, standard martingale techniques, and a novel pathwise argument inspired by rough path theory. Applying the corrector method, we finally extend these CLTs to the case where the realizations are not necessarily harmonic.","Satoshi Ishiwata1, Hiroshi Kawabi2 & Ryuya Namba",Potential Analysis,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11118-020-09851-7,"Central limit theorem,Non-symmetric random walk,Nilpotent covering graph,Discrete geometric analysis,Rough path theory"

Using techniques of Malliavin calculus, we establish upper and lower bounds on the one-point density of the solution u(t, x), and upper bounds of Gaussian-type on the two-point density of (u(s, y),u(t, x)). In particular, this estimate quantifies how this density degenerates as (s, y) → (t, x). From these results, we deduce upper and lower bounds on hitting probabilities of the process \({\{u(t,x)\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}_+, x\in [0,1]}}\), in terms of respectively Hausdorff measure and Newtonian capacity. These estimates make it possible to show that points are polar when d ≥ 7 and are not polar when d ≤ 5. We also show that the Hausdorff dimension of the range of the process is 6 when d > 6, and give analogous results for the processes \({t \mapsto u(t,x)}\) and \({x \mapsto u(t,x)}\).

0,Ordinal Optimization and Quantification of Heuristic Designs,"This paper focuses on the performance evaluation of complex man-made systems, such as assembly lines, electric power grid, traffic systems, and various paper processing bureaucracies, etc. For such problems, applying the traditional optimization tool of mathematical programming and gradient descent procedures of continuous variables optimization are often inappropriate or infeasible, as the design variables are usually discrete and the accurate evaluation of the system performance via a simulation model can take too much calculation. General search type and heuristic methods are the only two methods to tackle the problems. However, the “goodness” of heuristic methods is generally difficult to quantify while search methods often involve extensive evaluation of systems at many design choices in a large search space using a simulation model resulting in an infeasible computation burden. The purpose of this paper is to address these difficulties simultaneously by extending the recently developed methodology of Ordinal Optimization (OO). Uniform samples are taken out from the whole search space and evaluated with a crude but computationally easy model when applying OO. And, we argue, after ordering via the crude performance estimates, that the lined-up uniform samples can be seen as an approximate ruler. By comparing the heuristic design with such a ruler, we can quantify the heuristic design, just as we measure the length of an object with a ruler. In a previous paper we showed how to quantify a heuristic design for a special case but we did not have the OO ruler idea at that time. In this paper we propose the OO ruler idea and extend the quantifying method to the general case and the multiple independent results case.

Our method is based on coupling and does not use information inequalities. In case one has a uniform control on the coupling, one obtains exponential concentration inequalities. If such a uniform control is no more possible, then one obtains polynomial or stretched-exponential concentration inequalities. Our abstract results apply to Gibbs random fields, both at high and low temperatures and in particular to the low-temperature Ising model which is a concrete example of non-uniformity of the coupling.","J. -R.

0,Periodic or generational actuarial tables: which one to choose?,"The increase in life expectancy over the past several decades has been impressive and represents a key challenge for institutions that provide life insurance products. Indeed, when a new actuarial table is released with updated survival and death rates, such institutions need to update the amount of mathematical reserve that they need to set aside to guarantee the future payments of their annuities. As mortality forecasting techniques are currently well developed, it is relatively easy to forecast mortality over several decades and to directly use these forecast rates in the determination of the mathematical reserve needed to guarantee annuity payments. Future mortality evolution is then directly incorporated into the liabilities valuation of an institution, and it is thus commonly believed that such liabilities should not require much updating when a new actuarial table is released. In this paper, we demonstrate that contrary to this common belief, institutions that use generational tables (namely, tables including future mortality evolution) will most likely need to make more important adjustments (positive or negative) to their liabilities than will institutions using periodic (static) tables whenever a new table is released. By using three very different models to project mortality, we demonstrate that our findings are inherent in the required long horizons of the forecasts needed in the generational approach, with the uncertainty surrounding the forecast values increasing with the horizon. Therefore, generational tables may introduce more instability in a pension institution’s accounts than periodic tables.","Séverine Arnold1, Anca Jijiie

0,Randomized Incremental Construction of Delaunay Triangulations of Nice Point Sets,"Randomized incremental construction (RIC) is one of the most important paradigms for building geometric data structures. Clarkson and Shor developed a general theory that led to numerous algorithms which are both simple and efficient in theory and in practice. Randomized incremental constructions are usually space-optimal and time-optimal in the worst case, as exemplified by the construction of convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, and arrangements of line segments. However, the worst-case scenario occurs rarely in practice and we would like to understand how RIC behaves when the input is nice in the sense that the associated output is significantly smaller than in the worst case. For example, it is known that the Delaunay triangulation of nicely distributed points in \({\mathbb {E}}^d\) or on polyhedral surfaces in \({\mathbb {E}}^3\) has linear complexity, as opposed to a worst-case complexity of \(\Theta (n^{\lfloor d/2\rfloor })\) in the first case and quadratic in the second. The standard analysis does not provide accurate bounds on the complexity of such cases and we aim at establishing such bounds in this paper. More precisely, we will show that, in the two cases above and variants of them, the complexity of the usual RIC is \(O(n\log n)\), which is optimal. In other words, without any modification, RIC nicely adapts to good cases of practical value. At the heart of our proof is a bound on the complexity of the Delaunay triangulation of random subsets of \({\varepsilon }\)-nets. Along the way, we prove a probabilistic lemma for sampling without replacement, which may be of independent interest.","Jean-Daniel Boissonnat1, Olivier Devillers2, Kunal Dutta

A multi-item inventory model of breakable items is developed, where items are either complementary or substitute.

Also demand of one item decreases (increases) due to the presence of others in case of substitute (complementary) product.

The stochasticity is introduced in the vector field which transports the data in the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping framework for shape analysis and image registration. The stochasticity thereby models errors or uncertainties of the flow in following the prescribed deformation velocity. The approach is illustrated in the example of finite-dimensional landmark manifolds, whose stochastic evolution is studied both via the Fokker–Planck equation and by numerical simulations. We derive two approaches for inferring parameters of the stochastic model from landmark configurations observed at discrete time points. The first of the two approaches matches moments of the Fokker–Planck equation to sample moments of the data, while the second approach employs an expectation-maximization based algorithm using a Monte Carlo bridge sampling scheme to optimise the data likelihood. We derive and numerically test the ability of the two approaches to infer the spatial correlation length of the underlying noise.","Alexis Arnaudon1, Darryl D.

0,Post-transcriptional regulation in the nucleus and cytoplasm: study of mean time to threshold (MTT) and narrow escape problem,"Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) can be repressed and degraded by small non-coding RNA molecules. In this paper, we formulate a coarsegrained Markov-chain description of the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs by either small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or microRNAs (miRNAs). We calculate the probability of an mRNA escaping from its domain before it is repressed by siRNAs/miRNAs via calculation of the mean time to threshold: when the number of bound siRNAs/miRNAs exceeds a certain threshold value, the mRNA is irreversibly repressed. In some cases, the analysis can be reduced to counting certain paths in a reduced Markov model. We obtain explicit expressions when the small RNA bind irreversibly to the mRNA and we also discuss the reversible binding case. We apply our models to the study of RNA interference in the nucleus, examining the probability of mRNAs escaping via small nuclear pores before being degraded by siRNAs. Using the same modelling framework, we further investigate the effect of small, decoy RNAs (decoys) on the process of post-transcriptional regulation, by studying regulation of the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN: decoys are able to block binding sites on PTEN mRNAs, thereby reducing the number of sites available to siRNAs/miRNAs and helping to protect it from repression. We calculate the probability of a cytoplasmic PTEN mRNA translocating to the endoplasmic reticulum before being repressed by miRNAs. We support our results with stochastic simulations.","D.

This paper presents a highly-efficient method for determining the stationary probability density functions (PDFs) of MDOF nonlinear systems subjected to both additive and multiplicative Gaussian white noises. The proposed method takes advantages of the sufficient conditions of the reduced Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation when constructing the trial solution. The assumed solution consists of the analytically constructed trial solutions satisfying the sufficient conditions and an exponential polynomial of the state variables, and delivers a high accuracy of the solution because the analytically constructed trial solutions capture the main characteristics of the nonlinear system. We also make use of the concept from the data-science and propose a symbolic integration over a hypercube to replace the numerical integrations in higher-dimensional space, which has been regarded as the insurmountable difficulty in the classical method of weighted residuals or stochastic averaging for high-dimensional dynamic systems. Three illustrative examples of MDOF nonlinear systems are analyzed in detail. The accuracy of the numerical results is validated by comparison with the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) or the available exact solution. Furthermore, we also show the substantial gain in the computational efficiency of the proposed method compared with the MCS.","Lincong Chen1,2 & J. Q.

A tomographic reconstruction method based on Monte Carlo random searching guided by the information contained in the projections of radiographed objects is presented. In order to solve the optimization problem, a multiscale algorithm is proposed to reduce computation.

0,Pathwise Duals of Monotone and Additive Markov Processes,"This paper develops a systematic treatment of monotonicity-based pathwise dualities for Markov processes taking values in partially ordered sets. We show that every Markov process that takes values in a finite partially ordered set and whose generator can be represented in monotone maps has a pathwise dual process. In the special setting of attractive spin systems, this has been discovered earlier by Gray. We show that the dual simplifies a lot when the state space is a lattice (in the order-theoretic meaning of the word) and all monotone maps satisfy an additivity condition. This leads to a unified treatment of several well-known dualities, including Siegmund’s dual for processes with a totally ordered state space, duality of additive spin systems, and a duality due to Krone for the two-stage contact process, and allows for the construction of new dualities as well. We show that the well-known representation of additive spin systems in terms of open paths in a graphical representation can be generalized to additive Markov processes taking values in general lattices, but for the process and its dual to be representable on the same underlying space, we need to assume that the lattice is distributive. In the final section, we show how our results can be generalized from finite state spaces to interacting particle systems with finite local state spaces.","Anja Sturm

We show that the Wilson–Cowan equation can be obtained as the limit in uniform convergence on compacts in probability for a sequence of microscopic models when the number of neuron populations distributed in space and the number of neurons per population tend to infinity. This result also allows to obtain limits for qualitatively different stochastic convergence concepts, e.g., convergence in the mean. Further, we present a central limit theorem for the martingale part of the microscopic models which, suitably re-scaled, converges to a centred Gaussian process with independent increments. These two results provide the basis for presenting the neural field Langevin equation, a stochastic differential equation taking values in a Hilbert space, which is the infinite-dimensional analogue of the chemical Langevin equation in the present setting. On a technical level, we apply recently developed law of large numbers and central limit theorems for piecewise deterministic processes taking values in Hilbert spaces to a master equation formulation of stochastic neuronal network models.

0,Refined Analysis of Sparse MIMO Radar,"We analyze a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar model and provide recovery results for a compressed sensing (CS) approach. In MIMO radar different pulses are emitted by several transmitters and the echoes are recorded at several receiver nodes. Under reasonable assumptions the transformation from emitted pulses to the received echoes can approximately be regarded as linear. For the considered model, and many radar tasks in general, sparsity of targets within the considered angle-range-Doppler domain is a natural assumption. Therefore, it is possible to apply methods from CS in order to reconstruct the parameters of the targets. Assuming Gaussian random pulses the resulting measurement matrix becomes a highly structured random matrix. Our first main result provides an estimate for the well-known restricted isometry property (RIP) ensuring stable and robust recovery. We require more measurements than standard results from CS, like for example those for Gaussian random measurements. Nevertheless, we show that due to the special structure of the considered measurement matrix our RIP result is in fact optimal (up to possibly logarithmic factors). Our further two main results on nonuniform recovery (i.e., for a fixed sparse target scene) reveal how the fine structure of the support set—not only the size—affects the (nonuniform) recovery performance. We show that for certain “balanced” support sets reconstruction with essentially the optimal number of measurements is possible. Indeed, we introduce a parameter measuring the well-behavedness of the support set and resemble standard results from CS for near-optimal parameter choices. We prove recovery results for both perfect recovery of the support set in case of exactly sparse vectors and an \(\ell _2\)-norm approximation result for reconstruction under sparsity defect. Our analysis complements earlier work by Strohmer & Friedlander and deepens the understanding of the considered MIMO radar model.

We study the geometric properties of the complement \(\mathbb T ^d{{\setminus }} W[0,t]\) as \(t\rightarrow \infty \) for \(d\ge 3\). In particular, we show that the largest regions in \(\mathbb T ^d{{\setminus }} W[0,t]\) have a linear scale \(\varphi _d(t)=[(d\log t)/(d-2)\kappa _d t]^{1/(d-2)}\), where \(\kappa _d\) is the capacity of the unit ball. More specifically, we identify the sets \(E\) for which \(\mathbb T ^d{{\setminus }} W[0,t]\) contains a translate of \(\varphi _d(t)E\), and we count the number of disjoint such translates. Furthermore, we derive large deviation principles for the largest inradius of \(\mathbb T ^d{{\setminus }} W[0,t]\) as \(t\rightarrow \infty \) and the \(\varepsilon \)-cover time of \(\mathbb T ^d\) as \(\varepsilon \downarrow 0\). Our results, which generalise laws of large numbers proved by Dembo et al.

The idea behind this choice is that \(\mathbb T ^d {{\setminus }} W[0,t]\) consists of “lakes”, whose linear size is of order \(\varphi _d(t)\), connected by narrow “channels”.

0,Stochastic Modeling and Simulation of Viral Evolution,"RNA viruses comprise vast populations of closely related, but highly genetically diverse, entities known as quasispecies. Understanding the mechanisms by which this extreme diversity is generated and maintained is fundamental when approaching viral persistence and pathobiology in infected hosts. In this paper, we access quasispecies theory through a mathematical model based on the theory of multitype branching processes, to better understand the roles of mechanisms resulting in viral diversity, persistence and extinction. We accomplish this understanding by a combination of computational simulations and the theoretical analysis of the model. In order to perform the simulations, we have implemented the mathematical model into a computational platform capable of running simulations and presenting the results in a graphical format in real time. Among other things, we show that the establishment of virus populations may display four distinct regimes from its introduction into new hosts until achieving equilibrium or undergoing extinction. Also, we were able to simulate different fitness distributions representing distinct environments within a host which could either be favorable or hostile to the viral success. We addressed the most used mechanisms for explaining the extinction of RNA virus populations called lethal mutagenesis and mutational meltdown. We were able to demonstrate a correspondence between these two mechanisms implying the existence of a unifying principle leading to the extinction of RNA viruses.","Luiza Guimarães Fabreti1, Diogo Castro1, Bruno Gorzoni1, Luiz Mario Ramos Janini2 & …Fernando Antoneli

0,Simplices rarely contain their circumcenter in high dimensions,"Acute triangles are defined by having all angles less than π/2, and are characterized as the triangles containing their circumcenter in the interior. For simplices of dimension n ≥ 3, acuteness is defined by demanding that all dihedral angles between (n−1)-dimensional faces are smaller than π/2. However, there are, in a practical sense, too few acute simplices in general. This is unfortunate, since the acuteness property provides good qualitative features for finite element methods. The property of acuteness is logically independent of the property of containing the circumcenter when the dimension is greater than two. In this article, we show that the latter property is also quite rare in higher dimensions. In a natural probability measure on the set of n-dimensional simplices, we show that the probability that a uniformly random n-simplex contains its circumcenter is 1/2n.",Jon Eivind Vatne,Applications of Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.21136/AM.2017.0187-16,"simplex,circumcenter,finite element method"

0,Optimal fast Johnson–Lindenstrauss embeddings for large data sets,"Johnson–Lindenstrauss embeddings are widely used to reduce the dimension and thus the processing time of data. To reduce the total complexity, also fast algorithms for applying these embeddings are necessary. To date, such fast algorithms are only available either for a non-optimal embedding dimension or up to a certain threshold on the number of data points. We address a variant of this problem where one aims to simultaneously embed larger subsets of the data set. Our method follows an approach by Nelson et al. (New constructions of RIP matrices with fast multiplication and fewer rows. In: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp. 1515-1528, 2014): a subsampled Hadamard transform maps points into a space of lower, but not optimal dimension. Subsequently, a random matrix with independent entries projects to an optimal embedding dimension. For subsets whose size scales at least polynomially in the ambient dimension, the complexity of this method comes close to the number of operations just to read the data under mild assumptions on the size of the data set that are considerably less restrictive than in previous works. We also prove a lower bound showing that subsampled Hadamard matrices alone cannot reach an optimal embedding dimension. Hence, the second embedding cannot be omitted.","Stefan Bamberger

The inverse heat transfer problems are classified as ill-posed, that is, the solution may become unstable, mainly because they are sensitive to random errors deriving from the input data, necessitating a regularization method to soften these effects. The smoothing technique proposed by cubic spline regularization ensures that the global data tend to be more stable, with fewer data oscillations and dependent on a single arbitrary parameter input. It also shows that the weighted cubic spline is able to enhance filter action. The methods have been implemented in order for the search engine to optimize the choice of parameters and weight and, thus, the smoothing gains more flexibility and accuracy. The simulated and experimental tests confirm that the techniques are effective in reducing the amplified noise by inverse thermal problem presented.",Leticia Hiromi Kubo1 & Juliana de Oliveira,Computational and Applied Mathematics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-016-0385-x,"Cubic spline,Regularization,Ponderation,Inverse problem"

0,A reactive GRASP with path relinking for capacitated clustering,"This paper presents a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) coupled with path relinking (PR) to solve the problem of clustering n nodes in a graph into p clusters. The objective is to maximize the sum of the edge weights within each cluster such that the sum of the corresponding node weights does not exceed a fixed capacity. In phase I, both a heaviest weight edge (HWE) algorithm and a constrained minimum cut algorithm are used to select seeds for initializing the p clusters. Feasible solutions are obtained with the help of a self-adjusting restricted candidate list that sequentially guides the assignment of the remaining nodes. At each major GRASP iteration, the list length is randomly set based on a probability density function that is updated dynamically to reflect the solution quality realized in past iterations. In phase II, three neighborhoods, each defined by common edge and node swaps, are explored to attain local optimality. The following exploration strategies are investigated: cyclic neighborhood search, variable neighborhood descent, and randomized variable neighborhood descent (RVND). The best solutions found are stored in an elite pool.In a post-processing step, PR is applied to the pool members to cyclically generate paths between each pair. As new solutions are uncovered, a systematic attempt is made to improve a subset of them with local search. Should a better solution be found, it is saved temporally and placed in the pool after all the pairs are investigated and the bottom member is removed. The procedure ends when no further improvement is possible. Extensive computational testing was done to evaluate the various combinations of construction and local search strategies. For instances with up to 40 nodes and 5 clusters, the reactive GRASP with PR found optimal solutions within a negligible amount of time compared to CPLEX. In general, the HWE algorithm in the construction phase, RVND in the local search phase, and the use of PR provided the best results. The largest instances solved involved 82 nodes and 8 clusters.",Yumin Deng1 & Jonathan F.

A similar problem was previously considered in the steady case. Now the same problem is solved in the unsteady formulation. The numerical method is based on a generalization of the splitting method with respect to physical processes, which is widely used in rarefied gas dynamics. The basic difficulty faced in the natural generalization of this method as applied to thruster jets is that a boundary condition has to be taken into account when the ion distribution function is determined. This difficulty is overcome by analytically selecting the corresponding term at the stage of free-molecular motion. Another difficulty that can be coped with by the splitting method is that the ion and neutral velocity spaces have widely different scales. Techniques for making the method conservative are described, and situations in which this is necessary are discussed. Qualitative characteristics of some numerical computations are compared with experimental data. The comparison shows that the numerical method constructed adequately reproduces the behavior of the modeled object.",A. S. Arkhipov1 & A. M.

0,Two-category model of task allocation with application to ant societies,"In many network models of interacting units such as cells or insects, the coupling coefficients between units are independent of the state of the units. Here we analyze the temporal behavior of units that can switch between two ‘category’ states according to rules that involve category-dependent coupling coefficients. The behaviors of the category populations resulting from the asynchronous random updating of units are first classified according to the signs of the coupling coefficients using numerical simulations. They range from isolated fixed points to lines of fixed points and stochastic attractors. These behaviors are then explained analytically using iterated function systems and birth-death jump processes. The main inspiration for our work comes from studies of non-hierarchical task allocation in, e.g., harvester ant colonies where temporal fluctuations in the numbers of ants engaged in various tasks occur as circumstances require and depend on interactions between ants. We identify interaction types that produce quick recovery from perturbations to an asymptotic behavior whose characteristics are function of the coupling coefficients between ants as well as between ants and their environment. We also compute analytically the probability density of the population numbers, and show that perturbations in our model decay twice as fast as in a model with random switching dynamics. A subset of the interaction types between ants yields intrinsic stochastic asymptotic behaviors which could account for some of the experimentally observed fluctuations. Such noisy trajectories are shown to be random walks with state-dependent biases in the ‘category population’ phase space. With an external stimulus, the parameters of the category-switching rules become time-dependent. Depending on the growth rate of the stimulus in comparison to its population-dependent decay rate, the dynamics may qualitatively differ from the case without stimulus. Our simple two-category model provides a framework for understanding the rich variety of behaviors in network dynamics with state-dependent coupling coefficients, and especially in task allocation processes with many tasks.","Wendy A.

Emerging delivery devices are able to determine the actual dose that has been delivered at each stage facilitating the use of adaptive treatment plans that compensate for errors in delivery. We formulate a model of the day-to-day planning problem as a stochastic program and exhibit the gains that can be achieved by incorporating uncertainty about errors during treatment into the planning process. Due to size and time restrictions, the model becomes intractable for realistic instances. We show how heuristics and neuro-dynamic programming can be used to approximate the stochastic solution, and derive results from our models for realistic time periods.

However, if we consider a population of unstable systems that are capable to evolve (change their parameters), then such a population can be stable as T → ∞. This means that the probability to survive may be nonzero as T → ∞. Evolution algorithms that provide stability of populations are not trivial.

The first, a so-called “ganglion-brain” is characterized by completely random connections of all afferent tracts except certain ones which form the pathways for unconditioned responses. Certain expressions are derived which measure the learning potentiality of the ganglion— in particular, with respect to the number of responses which can be learned (conditioning potential) and the amount of interference between the learned responses (redundance potential).The second model concerns the progressive refinement of a response. The efficiency of learning in this case is reflected in the eventual specificity of the response which, in turn, depends on the modification of the distribution of thresholds associated with the neurons governing the responses. Expressions are derived relating the initial distribution of thresholds, the relative effectiveness of the various responses, and certain other parameters to the final distribution of thresholds. For a particular choice of the effectiveness distribution of responses the progressive sharpening of the threshold curve (i.e., progressive specificity of response) is demonstrated.

0,Probabilistic system opacity in discrete event systems,"In many emerging security applications, a system designer frequently needs to ensure that a certain property of a given system (that may reveal important details about the system’s operation) be kept secret (opaque) to outside observers (eavesdroppers). Motivated by such applications, several researchers have formalized, analyzed, and described methods to verify notions of opacity in discrete event systems of interest. This paper introduces and analyzes a notion of opacity in systems that can be modeled as probabilistic finite automata or hidden Markov models. We consider a setting where a user needs to choose a specific hidden Markov model (HMM) out of m possible (different) HMMs, but would like to “hide” the true system from eavesdroppers, by not allowing them to have an arbitrary level of confidence as to which system has been chosen. We describe necessary and sufficient conditions (that can be checked with polynomial complexity), under which the intruder cannot distinguish the true HMM, namely, the intruder cannot achieve a level of certainty about its decision, which is above a certain threshold that we can a priori compute.","Christoforos Keroglou1 nAff2 & Christoforos N.

In this article, we investigate how the infrastructure operator (defender) should prioritize the investment in securing a set of facilities in order to reduce the impact of a strategic adversary (attacker) who can target a facility to increase the overall usage cost of the system. We adopt a game-theoretic approach to model the defender-attacker interaction and study two models: normal form game—where both players move simultaneously—and sequential game—where attacker moves after observing the defender’s strategy. For each model, we provide a complete characterization of how the set of facilities that are secured by the defender in equilibrium vary with the costs of attack and defense. Importantly, our analysis provides a sharp condition relating the cost parameters for which the defender has the first-mover advantage. Specifically, we show that to fully deter the attacker from targeting any facility, the defender needs to proactively secure all “vulnerable facilities” at an appropriate level of effort. We illustrate the outcome of the attacker–defender interaction on a simple transportation network. We also suggest a dynamic learning setup to understand how this outcome can affect the ability of imperfectly informed users to make their decisions about using the system in the post-attack stage.","Manxi Wu

The reader should be aware of the fact that there are many very interesting papers covering other issues in the theory of branching processes in random environments which are not mentioned here.,"V.

0,Stochasticity and Time Delays in Evolutionary Games,"We discuss combined effects of stochasticity and time delays in simple evolutionary games with a unique mixed evolutionarily stable strategy. We present three models of time-delay stochastic dynamics of finite well-mixed or random-matching populations. We show that in the first two models the evolutionarily stable strategy loses its stability and there appears a stable cycle around it with the time period and the amplitude proportional to the delay. In the third model, only one randomly chosen individual can update his strategy at a time. This slows down the dynamics and makes the evolutionarily stable strategy stable with respect to both time delay and stochastic perturbations.",Jacek Miȩkisz1 & Sergiusz Wesołowski,Dynamic Games and Applications,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13235-011-0028-1,"Evolutionary game theory,Time delay,Stochastic dynamics,Stochastic stability,Stable cycles"
0,A primal-proximal heuristic applied to the French Unit-commitment problem,"This paper is devoted to the numerical resolution of unit-commitment problems, with emphasis on the French model optimizing the daily production of electricity. The solution process has two phases. First a Lagrangian relaxation solves the dual to find a lower bound; it also gives a primal relaxed solution. We then propose to use the latter in the second phase, for a heuristic resolution based on a primal proximal algorithm. This second step comes as an alternative to an earlier approach, based on augmented Lagrangian (i.e. a dual proximal algorithm). We illustrate the method with some real-life numerical results. A companion paper is devoted to a theoretical study of the heuristic in the second phase.","L. Dubost1, R. Gonzalez2 & C.

0,Boundaries and Harmonic Functions for Random Walks with Random Transition Probabilities,"The usual random walk on a group (homogeneous both in time and in space) is determined by a probability measure on the group. In a random walk with random transition probabilities this single measure is replaced with a stationary sequence of measures, so that the resulting (random) Markov chains are still space homogeneous, but no longer time homogeneous. We study various notions of measure theoretical boundaries associated with this model and establish an analogue of the Poisson formula for (random) bounded harmonic functions. Under natural conditions on transition probabilities we identify these boundaries for several classes of groups with hyperbolic properties and prove the boundary triviality (i.e., the absence of non-constant random bounded harmonic functions) for groups of subexponential growth, in particular, for nilpotent groups.","V.

0,Weak Stability of Centred Quadratic Stochastic Operators,"We consider the weak convergence of iterates of so-called centred quadratic stochastic operators. These iterations allow us to study the discrete time evolution of probability distributions of vector-valued traits in populations of inbreeding or hermaphroditic species, whenever the offspring’s trait is equal to an additively perturbed arithmetic mean of the parents’ traits. It is shown that for the existence of a weak limit, it is sufficient that the distributions of the trait and the perturbation have a finite variance or have tails controlled by a suitable power function. In particular, probability distributions from the domain of attraction of stable distributions have found an application, although in general the limit is not stable.","Krzysztof Bartoszek

0,Towards a new theory of confirmation,Any sequence of events can be “explained” by any of an infinite number of hypotheses. Popper describes the “logic of discovery” as a process of choosing from a hierarchy of hypotheses the first hypothesis which is not at variance with the observed facts. Blum and Blum formalized these hierarchies of hypotheses as hierarchies of infinite binary sequences and imposed on them certain decidability conditions. In this paper we also consider hierarchies of infinite binary sequences but we impose only the most elementary Bayesian considerations. We use the structure of such hierarchies to define “confirmation”. We then suggest a definition of probability based on the amount of confirmation a particular hypothesis (i.e. pattern) has received. We show that hypothesis confirmation alone is a sound basis for determining probabilities and in particular that Carnap’s logical and empirical criteria for determining probabilities are consequences of the confirmation criterion in appropriate limiting cases.,Moshe Koppel,Israel Journal of Mathematics,1985,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02761402,"Boolean Function,Initial Segment,Binary String,Inference Method,Total Evidence"

The problem has arisen in a number of interesting and seemingly unrelated areas, including wafer-scale integration of systolic arrays, two-dimensional discrepancy problems, and testing pseudorandom number generators. However, the minimax grid matching problem is best known for its application to the maximum up-right matching problem. The maximum up-right matching problem was originally defined by Karp, Luby and Marchetti-Spaccamela in association with algorithms for 2-dimensional bin packing. More recently, the up-right matching problem has arisen in the average case analysis of on-line algorithms for 1-dimen-sional bin packing and dynamic allocation.In this paper, we solve both the minimax grid matching problem and the maximum up-right matching problem. As a direct result, we obtain tight upper bounds on the average case behavior of the best algorithms known for 2-dimensional bin packing, 1-dimensional on-line bin packing and on-line dynamic allocation.

0,Bayesian doubly adaptive randomization in clinical trials,"Bayesian adaptive randomization has attracted increasingly attention in the literature and has been implemented in many phase II clinical trials. Doubly adaptive biased coin design (DBCD) is a superior choice in response-adaptive designs owing to its promising properties. In this paper, we propose a randomized design by combining Bayesian adaptive randomization with doubly adaptive biased coin design. By selecting a fixed tuning parameter, the proposed randomization procedure can target an explicit allocation proportion, and assign more patients to the better treatment simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed randomization is efficient to detect treatment differences. We illustrate the proposed design by its applications to both discrete and continuous responses, and evaluate its operating features through simulation studies.","YiKe Xiao1, ZhongQiang Liu2 & FeiFang Hu",Science China Mathematics,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-016-0056-1,"Bayesian approach,doubly adaptive biased coin design,power,type I error,allocation variability"
0,Coverage theories for metagenomic DNA sequencing based on a generalization of Stevens’ theorem,"Metagenomic project design has relied variously upon speculation, semi-empirical and ad hoc heuristic models, and elementary extensions of single-sample Lander–Waterman expectation theory, all of which are demonstrably inadequate. Here, we propose an approach based upon a generalization of Stevens’ Theorem for randomly covering a domain. We extend this result to account for the presence of multiple species, from which are derived useful probabilities for fully recovering a particular target microbe of interest and for average contig length. These show improved specificities compared to older measures and recommend deeper data generation than the levels chosen by some early studies, supporting the view that poor assemblies were due at least somewhat to insufficient data. We assess predictions empirically by generating roughly 4.5 Gb of sequence from a twelve member bacterial community, comparing coverage for two particular members, Selenomonas artemidis and Enterococcus faecium, which are the least (\(\sim \)3 %) and most (\(\sim \)12 %) abundant species, respectively. Agreement is reasonable, with differences likely attributable to coverage biases. We show that, in some cases, bias is simple in the sense that a small reduction in read length to simulate less efficient covering brings data and theory into essentially complete accord. Finally, we describe two applications of the theory. One plots coverage probability over the relevant parameter space, constructing essentially a “metagenomic design map” to enable straightforward analysis and design of future projects. The other gives an overview of the data requirements for various types of sequencing milestones, including a desired number of contact reads and contig length, for detection of a rare viral species.","Michael C.

An attractive model is the scale-free percolation model on the lattice \({\mathbb Z}^d\), \(d\ge 1\), because it fulfills several stylized facts observed in large real-life networks. We adopt this model to continuum space which leads to a heterogeneous random-connection model on \({\mathbb R}^d\): Particles are generated by a homogeneous marked Poisson point process on \({\mathbb R}^d\), and the probability of an edge between two particles is determined by their marks and their distance. In this model we study several properties such as the degree distributions, percolation properties and graph distances.","Philippe Deprez

The standing assumption is that the increments of the claims process possess exponential moments so that variations of the Lundberg upper bound for the probability of ruin are in reach. The traditional point of view in ruin theory is reversed: rather than studying the probability of ruin as a function of the initial reserve under fixed premium, the problem is to adjust the premium dynamically so as to obtain a given ruin probability (solvency requirement) for a fixed initial reserve (the financial capacity of the insurer). This programme is carried through in various models for the claims process, ranging from Cox processes with i.i.d. claim amounts, to conditional renewal (Sparre Andersen) processes.","Corina Constantinescu1,2, Véronique Maume-Deschamps3 & Ragnar Norberg",European Actuarial Journal,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13385-012-0046-4,"Lundberg upper bound,Martingalizing premium rate,General risk process"

0,Markov Random Field Modeling of the Spatial Distribution of Proteins on Cell Membranes,"
Cell membranes display a range of receptors that bind ligands and activate signaling pathways. Signaling is characterized by dramatic changes in membrane molecular topography, including the co-clustering of receptors with signaling molecules and the segregation of other signaling molecules away from receptors. Electron microscopy of immunogold-labeled membranes is a critical technique to generate topographical information at the 5–10 nm resolution needed to understand how signaling complexes assemble and function. However, due to experimental limitations, only two molecular species can usually be labeled at a time. A formidable challenge is to integrate experimental data across multiple experiments where there are from 10 to 100 different proteins and lipids of interest and only the positions of two species can be observed simultaneously. As a solution, we propose the use of Markov random field (MRF) modeling to reconstruct the distribution of multiple cell membrane constituents from pair-wise data sets. MRFs are a powerful mathematical formalism for modeling correlations between states associated with neighboring sites in spatial lattices. The presence or absence of a protein of a specific type at a point on the cell membrane is a state. Since only two protein types can be observed, i.e., those bound to particles, and the rest cannot be observed, the problem is one of deducing the conditional distribution of a MRF with unobservable (hidden) states. Here, we develop a multiscale MRF model and use mathematical programming techniques to infer the conditional distribution of a MRF for proteins of three types from observations showing the spatial relationships between only two types. Application to synthesized data shows that the spatial distributions of three proteins can be reliably estimated. Application to experimental data provides the first maps of the spatial relationship between groups of three different signaling molecules. The work is an important step toward a more complete understanding of membrane spatial organization and dynamics during signaling.

Being discrete and stochastic, however, our population nonetheless goes extinct in finite time. We present results concerning the maximum of the population prior to extinction in the large population limit, from which we obtain establishment probabilities and upper bounds for the process, as well as estimates for the waiting time to establishment and extinction. As a consequence, we show that conditional upon establishment, the stochastic logistic process will with high probability greatly exceed carrying capacity an arbitrary number of times prior to extinction.","Todd L.

We now report on the quantitative analysis ofo-uniqueness, which evaluates the tendency of small peptides to be repeated amongst different proteins, usually of a single species. A detailed analysis of theo-uniqueness of several proteins is presented to illustrate the method and the range of values encountered. Uniqueness data on sequences of human proteins in a data bank of sequences containing about 32,500 amino acids are made available in the form of a microfiche. Analysis of biologically active subsequences such as the angiotensins and the enkephalins suggest a tendency of the subsequences contributing to the property ofo-uniqueness to cluster in portions of the parent protein sequence which are biologically active. This property may provide a general method for predicting biologically active areas of proteins. Current data may already be adequate to permit useful predictions, and the rapidly accumulating and interrelated new data on nucleic acid and protein sequences will further enhance the power ofo-uniqueness analysis.",H.

After the interruption of the service rendered by the server, the system goes for the first verification to check why the service got interrupted. Then, multi-phase repair process starts, and the server goes for the second verification. The steady state queue size distribution and mean operational system metrics have been obtained by using probability generating function and supplementary variable methodology. Some special cases of the proposed model have also been discussed for the validity and verification with earlier existing models.

Universal quantitative bounds on the associated ergodic constants are deduced from Dobrushin's ergodic coefficient. Strong contraction properties in Orlicz spaces for relative densities are proved under more restrictive mixing assumptions. We also describe contraction bounds in the entropy sense around arbitrary probability measures by introducing a suitable Dirichlet form and the corresponding modified logarithmic Sobolev constants. The interest in these bounds is illustrated on the example of inhomogeneous Gaussian chains. In particular, the existence of an invariant measure is not required in general.","P. Del Moral1, M.

0,Network-based naive Bayes model for social network,"Naive Bayes (NB) is one of the most popular classification methods. It is particularly useful when the dimension of the predictor is high and data are generated independently. In the meanwhile, social network data are becoming increasingly accessible, due to the fast development of various social network services and websites. By contrast, data generated by a social network are most likely to be dependent. The dependency is mainly determined by their social network relationships. Then, how to extend the classical NB method to social network data becomes a problem of great interest. To this end, we propose here a network-based naive Bayes (NNB) method, which generalizes the classical NB model to social network data. The key advantage of the NNB method is that it takes the network relationships into consideration. The computational effciency makes the NNB method even feasible in large scale social networks. The statistical properties of the NNB model are theoretically investigated. Simulation studies have been conducted to demonstrate its finite sample performance. A real data example is also analyzed for illustration purpose.","Danyang Huang1, Guoyu Guan2, Jing Zhou1 & …Hansheng Wang",Science China Mathematics,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11425-017-9209-6,"classification,naive Bayes,Sina Weibo,social network data"

We establish that the probability that the origin is connected to distance n decays polynomially fast in n.


We prove that the critical cluster of 0 conditioned to survive to distance n has a typical width \(w_n\) satisfying \(\varepsilon n^{2/5}\le w_n\le n^{1-\varepsilon }\) for some \(\varepsilon >0\).

 The sub-linear polynomial fluctuations contrast with the supercritical regime where \(w_n\) is known to behave linearly in n. It is also different from the critical picture obtained for non-oriented Bernoulli percolation, in which the scaling limit is non-degenerate in both directions.

Namely, for a family of such operators that are continuous with positive probability, if the family is pointwise bounded with probability at least δ>0, then the operators are uniformly bounded with a probability that in each case can be estimated in terms of δ and the index of continuity of the operator. To achieve this result, we develop the fundamental theory of multivalued linear operators on general topological vector spaces.

0,Persistence and extinction for stochastic ecological models with internal and external variables,"The dynamics of species’ densities depend both on internal and external variables. Internal variables include frequencies of individuals exhibiting different phenotypes or living in different spatial locations. External variables include abiotic factors or non-focal species. These internal or external variables may fluctuate due to stochastic fluctuations in environmental conditions. The interplay between these variables and species densities can determine whether a particular population persists or goes extinct. To understand this interplay, we prove theorems for stochastic persistence and exclusion for stochastic ecological difference equations accounting for internal and external variables. Specifically, we use a stochastic analog of average Lyapunov functions to develop sufficient and necessary conditions for (i) all population densities spending little time at low densities i.e. stochastic persistence, and (ii) population trajectories asymptotically approaching the extinction set with positive probability. For (i) and (ii), respectively, we provide quantitative estimates on the fraction of time that the system is near the extinction set, and the probability of asymptotic extinction as a function of the initial state of the system. Furthermore, in the case of persistence, we provide lower bounds for the expected time to escape neighborhoods of the extinction set. To illustrate the applicability of our results, we analyze stochastic models of evolutionary games, Lotka–Volterra dynamics, trait evolution, and spatially structured disease dynamics. Our analysis of these models demonstrates environmental stochasticity facilitates coexistence of strategies in the hawk–dove game, but inhibits coexistence in the rock–paper–scissors game and a Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model. Furthermore, environmental fluctuations with positive auto-correlations can promote persistence of evolving populations and persistence of diseases in patchy landscapes. While our results help close the gap between the persistence theories for deterministic and stochastic systems, we highlight several challenges for future research.",Michel Benaïm1 & Sebastian J.

We show that for this class of models the empirical degree distribution tends almost surely and in norm to the expected degree distribution as the size of the graph grows to infinity and we provide a simple asymptotic expression for the expected degree distribution. Convergence of the empirical degree distribution has consequences for statistical analysis of network data in that it allows the full data to be summarized by the degree distribution of the nodes without losing the ability to obtain consistent estimates of parameters describing the network.","Oskar Hagberg1 & Carsten Wiuf1,",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-006-9085-9,"biological network,network model,Markov chain,randomly grown grapsh"

0,Finding the best resolution for the Kingman–Tajima coalescent: theory and applications,"Many summary statistics currently used in population genetics and in phylogenetics depend only on a rather coarse resolution of the underlying tree (the number of extant lineages, for example). Hence, for computational purposes, working directly on these resolutions appears to be much more efficient. However, this approach seems to have been overlooked in the past. In this paper, we describe six different resolutions of the Kingman–Tajima coalescent together with the corresponding Markov chains, which are essential for inference methods. Two of the resolutions are the well-known \(n\)-coalescent and the lineage death process due to Kingman. Two other resolutions were mentioned by Kingman and Tajima, but never explicitly formalized. Another two resolutions are novel, and complete the picture of a multi-resolution coalescent. For all of them, we provide the forward and backward transition probabilities, the probability of visiting a given state as well as the probability of a given realization of the full Markov chain. We also provide a description of the state-space that highlights the computational gain obtained by working with lower-resolution objects. Finally, we give several examples of summary statistics that depend on a coarser resolution of Kingman’s coalescent, on which simulations are usually based.","Raazesh Sainudiin1, Tanja Stadler2 & Amandine Véber",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-014-0796-5,"

0,From individual-based epidemic models to McKendrick-von Foerster PDEs: a guide to modeling and inferring COVID-19 dynamics,"We present a unifying, tractable approach for studying the spread of viruses causing complex diseases requiring to be modeled using a large number of types (e.g., infective stage, clinical state, risk factor class). We show that recording each infected individual’s infection age, i.e., the time elapsed since infection, has three benefits. First, regardless of the number of types, the age distribution of the population can be described by means of a first-order, one-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE) known as the McKendrick-von Foerster equation. The frequency of type i is simply obtained by integrating the probability of being in state i at a given age against the age distribution. This representation induces a simple methodology based on the additional assumption of Poisson sampling to infer and forecast the epidemic. We illustrate this technique using French data from the COVID-19 epidemic. Second, our approach generalizes and simplifies standard compartmental models using high-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to account for disease complexity. We show that such models can always be rewritten in our framework, thus, providing a low-dimensional yet equivalent representation of these complex models. Third, beyond the simplicity of the approach, we show that our population model naturally appears as a universal scaling limit of a large class of fully stochastic individual-based epidemic models, where the initial condition of the PDE emerges as the limiting age structure of an exponentially growing population starting from a single individual.","Félix Foutel-Rodier

0,An information guided framework for simulated annealing,"This paper presents an information guided framework for stochastic optimization with simulated annealing. Information gathered during randomized exploration of the search domain is used as feedback with progressively increasing gain to drive the optimization procedure, potentially causing the annealing temperature to rise during the algorithm’s execution. The benefits of reheating during the annealing process are shown in terms of significant improvement in the algorithm’s performance, while also staying within bounds for its convergence. A guided-annealing temperature is defined that incorporates information into the annealing schedule. The resulting algorithm has two phases: phase I performs nearly unrestricted exploration as a reconnaissance of the optimization domain and phase II “re-heats” the annealing procedure and exploits information gathered during phase I. Phase I flows seamlessly into phase II via an information effectiveness parameter without need for user input. Conditions are derived to prevent excessive reheating that may jeopardize convergence characteristics.

Secondly, these tools allow to construct stabilizing measures and to avoid the assumption of stability under concatenation for controls. The domain of controllability is then characterized as some level set of a convenient solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi integral-differential equation.

The optimization framework is particularly important for financial institutions which have to follow short-time VaR-type regulations under some realistic regulatory frameworks like Solvency II, but need to serve long-term liabilities. Deriving closed-form solutions, we show that risk management using multiple VaR constraints is more useful for loss prevention at intertemporal time instances compared with the well-known result of the one-VaR problem in Basak and Shapiro (Rev Financ Stud 14:371–405, 2001), confirming the numerical analysis of Shi and Werker (J Bank Finance 36(12):3227–3238, 2012). In addition, the multiple-VaR solution at maturity on average dominates the one-VaR solution in a wide range of intermediate market scenarios, but performs worse in good and very bad market scenarios. The range of these very bad market scenarios is however rather limited. Finally, we show that it is preferable to reach a fixed terminal state through insured intertemporal states rather than through extreme up and down movements, showing that a multiple-VaR framework induces a preference for less volatility.","An Chen1, Thai Nguyen1,2 & Mitja Stadje",Mathematical Methods of Operations Research,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00186-018-0637-1,"Value at Risk,Optimal portfolio,Multiple risk constraints,Risk management,Solvency II regulation"

We relax the independence and even the martingale difference assumptions on the innovation process to extend considerably the range of application of the FARIMA models. We propose a consistent estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the LSE which may be very different from that obtained in the standard framework. A self-normalized approach to confidence interval construction for weak FARIMA model parameters is also presented. All our results are done under a mixing assumption on the noise. Finally, some simulation studies and an application to the daily returns of stock market indices are presented to corroborate our theoretical work.

Recognition objects often form a single interconnected array determined by the nature of the event involved, namely, its natural extent in time or in space along one or a few coordinates. As a consequence, the need arises to take consistent decisions about the classes for all elements of the array.

0,Multiplicative Schrödinger problem and the Dirichlet transport,"We consider an optimal transport problem on the unit simplex whose solutions are given by gradients of exponentially concave functions and prove two main results. First, we show that the optimal transport is the large deviation limit of a particle system of Dirichlet processes transporting one probability measure on the unit simplex to another by coordinatewise multiplication and normalizing. The structure of our Lagrangian and the appearance of the Dirichlet process relate our problem closely to the entropic measure on the Wasserstein space as defined by von-Renesse and Sturm in the context of Wasserstein diffusion. The limiting procedure is a triangular limit where we allow simultaneously the number of particles to grow to infinity while the ‘noise’ tends to zero. The method, which generalizes easily to many other cost functions, including the squared Euclidean distance, provides a novel combination of the Schrödinger problem approach due to C. Léonard and the related Brownian particle systems by Adams et al. which does not require gamma convergence. Second, we analyze the behavior of entropy along the paths of transport. The reference measure on the simplex is taken to be the Dirichlet measure with all zero parameters which relates to the finite-dimensional distributions of the entropic measure. The interpolating curves are not the usual McCann lines. Nevertheless we show that entropy plus a multiple of the transport cost remains convex, which is reminiscent of the semiconvexity of entropy along lines of McCann interpolations in negative curvature spaces. We also obtain, under suitable conditions, dimension-free bounds of the optimal transport cost in terms of entropy.

0,Game-Theoretic Frameworks for Epidemic Spreading and Human Decision-Making: A Review,"This review presents and reviews various solved and open problems in developing, analyzing, and mitigating epidemic spreading processes under human decision-making. We provide a review of a range of epidemic models and explain the pros and cons of different epidemic models. We exhibit the art of coupling between epidemic models and decision models in the existing literature. More specifically, we provide answers to fundamental questions in human decision-making amid epidemics, including what interventions to take to combat the disease, who are decision-makers, and when and how to take interventions, and how to make interventions. Among many decision models, game-theoretic models have become increasingly crucial in modeling human responses or behavior amid epidemics in the last decade. In this review, we motivate the game-theoretic approach to human decision-making amid epidemics. This review provides an overview of the existing literature by developing a multi-dimensional taxonomy, which categorizes existing literature based on multiple dimensions, including (1) types of games, such as differential games, stochastic games, evolutionary games, and static games; (2) types of interventions, such as social distancing, vaccination, quarantine, and taking antidotes; (3) the types of decision-makers, such as individuals, adversaries, and central authorities at different hierarchical levels. A fine-grained dynamic game framework is proposed to capture the essence of game-theoretic decision-making amid epidemics. We showcase three representative frameworks with unique ways of integrating game-theoretic decision-making into the epidemic models from a vast body of literature. Each of the three frameworks has their unique way of modeling and analyzing and develops results from different angles. In the end, we identify several main open problems and research gaps left to be addressed and filled.","Yunhan Huang

The analyses are done for the one-commodity pickup-and-delivery TSP, as this problem also includes the setting of the initial load. The paper first considers feasibility issues.

Different variants are considered as a function of the time when information becomes available.

0,"Multi-self-similar Markov processes on ℝ+
n and their Lamperti representations"," A classical result, due to Lamperti, establishes a one-to-one correspondence between a class of strictly positive Markov processes that are self-similar, and the class of one-dimensional Lévy processes. This correspondence is obtained by suitably time-changing the exponential of the Lévy process. In this paper we generalise Lamperti's result to processes in n dimensions. For the representation we obtain, it is essential that the same time-change be applied to all coordinates of the processes involved. Also for the statement of the main result we need the proper concept of self-similarity in higher dimensions, referred to as multi-self-similarity in the paper. The special case where the Lévy process ξ is standard Brownian motion in n dimensions is studied in detail. There are also specific comments on the case where ξ  is an n-dimensional compound Poisson process with drift. Finally, we present some results concerning moment sequences, obtained by studying the multi-self-similar processes that correspond to n-dimensional subordinators.",Martin Jacobsen1 & Marc Yor,Probability Theory and Related Fields,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-003-0263-5,"Brownian Motion,High Dimension,Markov Process,Poisson Process,Classical Result"
0,A surrogate-based multiobjective metaheuristic and network degradation simulation model for robust toll pricing,"Robust transportation network design problems generally rely on systems engineering methods that share common research gaps. First, problem sizes are constrained due to the use of multi-objective solution algorithms that are notoriously inefficient due to computationally expensive function evaluations. Second, link disruptions at a network level are difficult to model realistically. In this paper, a stochastic search metaheuristic based on radial basis functions is proposed for constrained multiobjective problems. It is proven to converge, and compared with conventional metaheuristics for four representative test problems. A scenario simulation method based on multivariate Bernoulli random variables that accounts for correlations between link failures is proposed to sample scenarios for a mean-variance toll pricing problem. Four tests are conducted on the classical Sioux Falls network to gain some insights into the algorithm, the simulation model, and to the robust toll pricing problem. The first test empirically measures the efficiency of the simulation algorithm and approximate Pareto set by obtaining a standard error in the ε-indicator measure for a given number of scenarios and iterations. The second test compares the dominance of the proposed heuristic’s solutions with a conventional multiobjective genetic algorithm by comparing the average ε-indicator. The third test quantifies the gap due to falsely assuming that link failures are independent of each other when they are not. The last test quantifies the value of having the flexibility to adapt a Pareto set of toll pricing solutions to changing probability regimes such as peak and off-peak hurricane or snow seasons.",Joseph Y.

The results involve the weak convergence of the suitably scaledn-fold convolution of certain complex atomic or absolutely continuous measures μ of spectral radius 1 to ahypergaussian measure γβ whose Fourier-Stieltjes transform is exp(−θ2β for a positive integer β. The proof uses a generalization of the method of characteristic functions. Counter-examples are given to rather more general statements that had appeared previously in the literature.

0,A new contraction technique with applications to congruency-constrained cuts,"Minimum cut problems are among the most classical problems in Combinatorial Optimization and are used in a wide set of applications. Some of the best-known efficiently solvable variants include global mininmum cuts, minimum s–t cuts, and minimum odd cuts in undirected graphs. We study a problem class that can be seen to generalize the above variants, namely finding congruency-constrained minimum cuts, i.e., we consider cuts whose number of vertices is congruent to r modulo m, for some integers r and m. Apart from being a natural generalization of odd cuts, congruency-constrained minimum cuts exhibit an interesting link to a long-standing open problem in Integer Programming, namely whether integer programs described by an integer constraint matrix with bounded subdeterminants can be solved efficiently. We develop a new contraction technique inspired by Karger’s celebrated contraction algorithm for minimum cuts, which, together with further insights, leads to a polynomial time randomized approximation scheme for congruency-constrained minimum cuts for any constant modulus m. Instead of contracting edges of the original graph, we use splitting-off techniques to create an auxiliary graph on a smaller vertex set, which is used for performing random edge contractions. This way, a well-structured distribution of candidate pairs of vertices to be contracted is obtained, where the involved pairs are generally not connected by an edge. As a byproduct, our technique reveals new structural insights into near-minimum odd cuts, and, more generally, near-minimum congruency-constrained cuts.

0,On a smoothed penalty-based algorithm for global optimization,"This paper presents a coercive smoothed penalty framework for nonsmooth and nonconvex constrained global optimization problems. The properties of the smoothed penalty function are derived. Convergence to an \(\varepsilon \)-global minimizer is proved. At each iteration k, the framework requires the \(\varepsilon ^{(k)}\)-global minimizer of a subproblem, where \(\varepsilon ^{(k)} \rightarrow \varepsilon \). We show that the subproblem may be solved by well-known stochastic metaheuristics, as well as by the artificial fish swarm (AFS) algorithm. In the limit, the AFS algorithm convergence to an \(\varepsilon ^{(k)}\)-global minimum of the real-valued smoothed penalty function is guaranteed with probability one, using the limiting behavior of Markov chains. In this context, we show that the transition probability of the Markov chain produced by the AFS algorithm, when generating a population where the best fitness is in the \(\varepsilon ^{(k)}\)-neighborhood of the global minimum, is one when this property holds in the current population, and is strictly bounded from zero when the property does not hold. Preliminary numerical experiments show that the presented penalty algorithm based on the coercive smoothed penalty gives very competitive results when compared with other penalty-based methods.","Ana Maria A.

0,On Unbounded Delays in Asynchronous Parallel Fixed-Point Algorithms,"The need for scalable solvers for massive optimization problems has motivated the development of asynchronous-parallel algorithms, where a set of nodes runs in parallel with little or no synchronization, thus computing with delayed information. This paper develops powerful Lyapunov-functions techniques, and uses them to study the convergence of the asynchronous-parallel algorithm ARock under potentially unbounded delays. ARock is a very general asynchronous algorithm, that takes many popular algorithms as special cases: for instance, asynchronous block gradient descent, forward backward, ADMM, etc. Therefore our results have broad implications, and a range of applications. ARock parallelizes a fixed-point iterations by letting a set of nodes randomly choose solution coordinates to update in an asynchronous parallel fashion. The existing analysis of ARock assumes the delays to be bounded, and uses this bound to set a step size that is important to both convergence and efficiency. Other works, though allowing unbounded delays, impose strict conditions on the underlying fixed-point operator, resulting in limited applications. In this paper, convergence is established under unbounded delays, which can be either stochastic or deterministic. The proposed step sizes are more practical and larger than those in the existing work. The step size adapts to the delay distribution or the current delay being experienced in the system, instead of being limited by worst-case scenario delays. New Lyapunov functions, which are the key to analyzing asynchronous algorithms, are generated to obtain our results. A general strategy for generating Lyapunov functions is presented, which may find application in convergence analyses of other algorithms. A set of applicable optimization algorithms with large-scale applications are given, including machine learning and scientific computing algorithms.","Robert Hannah1 & Wotao Yin

0,Enumeration of Viral Capsid Assembly Pathways: Tree Orbits Under Permutation Group Action,"This paper uses combinatorics and group theory to answer questions about the assembly of icosahedral viral shells. Although the geometric structure of the capsid (shell) is fairly well understood in terms of its constituent subunits, the assembly process is not. For the purpose of this paper, the capsid is modeled by a polyhedron whose facets represent the monomers. The assembly process is modeled by a rooted tree, the leaves representing the facets of the polyhedron, the root representing the assembled polyhedron, and the internal vertices representing intermediate stages of assembly (subsets of facets). Besides its virological motivation, the enumeration of orbits of trees under the action of a finite group is of independent mathematical interest. If G is a finite group acting on a finite set X, then there is a natural induced action of G on the set \(\mathcal{T}_{X}\) of trees whose leaves are bijectively labeled by the elements of X. If G acts simply on X, then |X|:=|X

n
|=n⋅|G|, where n is the number of G-orbits in X. The basic combinatorial results in this paper are (1) a formula for the number of orbits of each size in the action of G on \(\mathcal{T}_{X_{n}}\), for every n, and (2) a simple algorithm to find the stabilizer of a tree \(\tau\in\mathcal{T} _{X}\) in G that runs in linear time and does not need memory in addition to its input tree. These results help to clarify the effect of symmetry on the probability and number of assembly pathways for icosahedral viral capsids, and more generally for any finite, symmetric macromolecular assembly.","Miklós Bóna1, Meera Sitharam2 & Andrew Vince",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-010-9606-4,"Tree enumeration,Generating function,Group action,Viral capsid assembly"

0,An improved model in fusing multi-source information based on Z-numbers and POWA operator,"Information of the real world is often imperfect and partially reliable. Thus, processing the uncertain information is of great importance. Z-number, proposed by Zadeh, is an effective tool to describe the real-world information, which contains both fuzziness and reliability of information. In most decision-making problems, information is usually provided by experts. However, opinions among experts may be conflicting. How to deal with the opinions of multiple experts from an objective point of view, especially when there is a conflict among the opinions of multiple experts, is still an open issue. Therefore, in this paper, an improved model in fusing multi-source information based on Z-numbers and power ordered weighted average (POWA) operator is proposed, considering both the decision makers’ attitude characteristics and the support degree among evidence. The soft likelihood function based on Z-numbers is included in the improved model.

0,Symmetrical Independence Tests for Two Random Vectors with Arbitrary Dimensional Graphs,"Test of independence between random vectors X and Y is an essential task in statistical inference. One type of testing methods is based on the minimal spanning tree of variables X and Y. The main idea is to generate the minimal spanning tree for one random vector X, and for each edges in minimal spanning tree, the corresponding rank number can be calculated based on another random vector Y. The resulting test statistics are constructed by these rank numbers. However, the existed statistics are not symmetrical tests about the random vectors X and Y such that the power performance from minimal spanning tree of X is not the same as that from minimal spanning tree of Y. In addition, the conclusion from minimal spanning tree of X might conflict with that from minimal spanning tree of Y. In order to solve these problems, we propose several symmetrical independence tests for X and Y. The exact distributions of test statistics are investigated when the sample size is small. Also, we study the asymptotic properties of the statistics. A permutation method is introduced for getting critical values of the statistics.

0,Statistical Inconsistency of Maximum Parsimony for k-Tuple-Site Data,"One of the main aims of phylogenetics is to reconstruct the “Tree of Life.” In this respect, different methods and criteria are used to analyze DNA sequences of different species and to compare them in order to derive the evolutionary relationships of these species. Maximum parsimony is one such criterion for tree reconstruction, and it is the one which we will use in this paper. However, it is well known that tree reconstruction methods can lead to wrong relationship estimates. One typical problem of maximum parsimony is long branch attraction, which can lead to statistical inconsistency. In this work, we will consider a blockwise approach to alignment analysis, namely the so-called k-tuple analyses. For four taxa, it has already been shown that k-tuple-based analyses are statistically inconsistent if and only if the standard character-based (site-based) analyses are statistically inconsistent. So, in the four-taxon case, going from individual sites to k-tuples does not lead to any improvement. However, real biological analyses often consider more than only four taxa. Therefore, we analyze the case of five taxa for 2- and 3-tuple-site data and consider alphabets with two and four elements. We show that the equivalence of single-site data and k-tuple-site data then no longer holds. Even so, we can show that maximum parsimony is statistically inconsistent for k-tuple-site data and five taxa.","Michelle Galla1, Kristina Wicke

0,Chance-constrained problems and rare events: an importance sampling approach,"We study chance-constrained problems in which the constraints involve the probability of a rare event. We discuss the relevance of such problems and show that the existing sampling-based algorithms cannot be applied directly in this case, since they require an impractical number of samples to yield reasonable solutions. We argue that importance sampling (IS) techniques, combined with a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) approach, can be effectively used in such situations, provided that variance can be reduced uniformly with respect to the decision variables. We give sufficient conditions to obtain such uniform variance reduction, and prove asymptotic convergence of the combined SAA-IS approach. As it often happens with IS techniques, the practical performance of the proposed approach relies on exploiting the structure of the problem under study; in our case, we work with a telecommunications problem with Bernoulli input distributions, and show how variance can be reduced uniformly over a suitable approximation of the feasibility set by choosing proper parameters for the IS distributions. Although some of the results are specific to this problem, we are able to draw general insights that can be useful for other classes of problems. We present numerical results to illustrate our findings.","Javiera Barrera

By representing the inter-arrival, service and vacation times using a Markov-based approach, we are able to analyze this model as a level-dependent quasi-birth-and-death (LDQBD) process which makes the model algorithmically tractable. Several performance measures such as the stationary probability distribution and the expected number of customers in the orbit have been discussed with two different policies: deterministic time-controlled system and random time-controlled system.

0,Centrifugal-order distributions in binary topological trees,Statistical properties of topological binary trees are studied on the basis of the distribution of segments in relation to centrifugal order. Special attention is paid to the mean of this distribution in a tree as it will be used as a measure of tree topology. It will be shown how the expectation of the mean centrifugal order depends both on the size of the tree and on the mode of growth in the context of modelling the growth of tree structures. Observed trees can be characterized by their mean orders and procedures are described to find the growth mode that optimally corresponds to these data. The variance structure of the mean-order measure appears to be a crucial factor in these fitting procedures. Examples indicate that mean-order analysis is an accurate alternative to partition analysis that is based on the partitioning of segments over sub-tree pairs at branching points.,"J. van Pelt1, R. W.

For statistical applications, such as construction of upper confidence bounds, particularly, in problems related to the auditing mathematics, computable and as precise as possible inequalities are required. This is the main motivation to write this paper. We examine general properties of the transform and consider special cases of normal, exponential, Bernoulli, binomial, uniform, and Poisson tails.

0,On the optimization landscape of tensor decompositions,"Non-convex optimization with local search heuristics has been widely used in machine learning, achieving many state-of-art results. It becomes increasingly important to understand why they can work for these NP-hard problems on typical data. The landscape of many objective functions in learning has been conjectured to have the geometric property that “all local optima are (approximately) global optima”, and thus they can be solved efficiently by local search algorithms. However, establishing such property can be very difficult. In this paper, we analyze the optimization landscape of the random over-complete tensor decomposition problem, which has many applications in unsupervised learning, especially in learning latent variable models. In practice, it can be efficiently solved by gradient ascent on a non-convex objective. We show that for any small constant \(\varepsilon > 0\), among the set of points with function values \((1+\varepsilon )\)-factor larger than the expectation of the function, all the local maxima are approximate global maxima. Previously, the best-known result only characterizes the geometry in small neighborhoods around the true components. Our result implies that even with an initialization that is barely better than the random guess, the gradient ascent algorithm is guaranteed to solve this problem. However, achieving such a initialization with random guess would still require super-polynomial number of attempts. Our main technique uses Kac–Rice formula and random matrix theory. To our best knowledge, this is the first time when Kac–Rice formula is successfully applied to counting the number of local optima of a highly-structured random polynomial with dependent coefficients.","Rong Ge

0,"Local convergence of the
(exact and inexact) iterative aggregation method for linear systems and Markov operators
","The iterative aggregation method
for the solution of linear systems is
extended in several directions:
to operators on Banach spaces; to the method with inexact correction, i.e.,
to methods where the (inner) linear system  is in turn solved
iteratively; and to the problem of finding
stationary distributions of Markov operators.
Local convergence is shown in all cases.
Convergence results apply to the particular case of stochastic
matrices. Moreover, an argument is given which suggests why the
iterative aggregation method works so well for nearly
uncoupled Markov chains, as well as for Markov chains with
other zero-nonzero structures.

0,Simple decentralized graph coloring,"Graph coloring is a classical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with many practical applications. A broad range of heuristic methods exist for tackling the graph coloring problem: from fast greedy algorithms to more time-consuming metaheuristics. Although the latter produce better results in terms of minimizing the number of colors, the former are widely employed due to their simplicity. These heuristic methods are centralized since they operate by using complete knowledge of the graph. However, in real-world environmets where each component only interacts with a limited number of other components, the only option is to apply decentralized methods. This paper explores a novel and simple algorithm for decentralized graph coloring that uses a fixed number of colors and iteratively reduces the edge conflicts in the graph. We experimentally demonstrate that, for most of the tested instances, the new algorithm outperforms a recent and very competitive algorithm for decentralized graph coloring in terms of coloring quality. In our experiments, the fixed number of colors used by the new algorithm is controlled in a centralized manner.",Severino F.

The random walk is assumed to be spatially homogeneous and irreducible. The branching mechanism at each catalyst, being independent of the random walk, is governed by a Markov branching process.

This breadth is particularly notable for two types of processes captured: First, it not only describes any partial sum process built from iid summands in the domain of normal attraction of X(1), but also addresses those with arbitrary iid summands in the full domain of attraction (here we give a technical condition necessary and sufficient for the partial sum process to share the exact LIL we prove for X). Second, it reveals that any Lévy process L such that L(1) satisfies the technical condition just mentioned will also share the LIL of X.

0,Joint chance-constrained staffing optimization in multi-skill call centers,"This paper concerns the staffing optimization problem in multi-skill call centers. The objective is to find a minimal cost staffing solution while meeting a target level for the quality of service (QoS) to customers. We consider a staffing problem in which joint chance constraints are imposed on the QoS of the day. Our joint chance-constrained formulation is more rational capturing the correlation between different call types, as compared to separate chance-constrained versions considered in previous studies. We show that, in general, the probability functions in the joint-chance constraints display S-shaped curves, and the optimal solutions should belong to the concave regions of the curves. Thus, we propose an approach combining a heuristic phase to identify solutions lying in the concave part and a simulation-based cut generation phase to create outer-approximations of the probability functions. This allows us to find good staffing solutions satisfying the joint-chance constraints by simulation and linear programming. We test our formulation and algorithm using call center examples of up to 65 call types and 89 agent groups, which shows the benefits of our joint-chance constrained formulation and the advantage of our algorithm over standard ones.","Tien Thanh Dam1, Thuy Anh Ta

The algorithm solves the problem by solving a sequence of linear stationary point problems. Each problem in the sequence is solved in a finite number of iterations.

0,"On the role of convexity in isoperimetry, spectral gap and concentration","We show that for convex domains in Euclidean space, Cheeger’s isoperimetric inequality, spectral gap of the Neumann Laplacian, exponential concentration of Lipschitz functions, and the a-priori weakest requirement that Lipschitz functions have arbitrarily slow uniform tail-decay, are all quantitatively equivalent (to within universal constants, independent of the dimension). This substantially extends previous results of Maz’ya, Cheeger, Gromov–Milman, Buser and Ledoux. As an application, we conclude a sharp quantitative stability result for the spectral gap of convex domains under convex perturbations which preserve volume (up to constants) and under maps which are “on-average” Lipschitz. We also provide a new characterization (up to constants) of the spectral gap of a convex domain, as one over the square of the average distance from the “worst” subset having half the measure of the domain. In addition, we easily recover and extend many previously known lower bounds on the spectral gap of convex domains, due to Payne–Weinberger, Li–Yau, Kannan–Lovász–Simonovits, Bobkov and Sodin. The proof involves estimates on the diffusion semi-group following Bakry–Ledoux and a result from Riemannian Geometry on the concavity of the isoperimetric profile.

0,Weak interaction limits for one-dimensional random polymers," In this paper we present a new and flexible method to show that, in one dimension, various self-repellent random walks converge to self-repellent Brownian motion in the limit of weak interaction after appropriate space-time scaling. Our method is based on cutting the path into pieces of an appropriately scaled length, controlling the interaction between the different pieces, and applying an invariance principle to the single pieces. In this way, we show that the self-repellent random walk large deviation rate function for the empirical drift of the path converges to the self-repellent Brownian motion large deviation rate function after appropriate scaling with the interaction parameters. The method is considerably simpler than the approach followed in our earlier work, which was based on functional analytic arguments applied to variational representations and only worked in a very limited number of situations. We consider two examples of a weak interaction limit: (1) vanishing self-repellence, (2) diverging step variance. In example (1), we recover our earlier scaling results for simple random walk with vanishing self-repellence and show how these can be extended to random walk with steps that have zero mean and a finite exponential moment. Moreover, we show that these scaling results are stable against adding self-attraction, provided the self-repellence dominates. In example (2), we prove a conjecture by Aldous for the scaling of self-avoiding walk with diverging step variance. Moreover, we consider self-avoiding walk on a two-dimensional horizontal strip such that the steps in the vertical direction are uniform over the width of the strip and find the scaling as the width tends to infinity.","Remco van der Hofstad1, Frank den Hollander2 & Wolfgang König",Probability Theory and Related Fields,2003,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-002-0248-9,"Random Walk,Vertical Direction,Interaction Parameter,Weak Interaction,Variational Representation"

Probabilistic modeling cannot handle situations with incomplete or little information on which to evaluate a probability, or when that information is nonspecific, ambiguous, or conflicting [12], [47], [50]. Many interval-based uncertainty models have been developed to treat such situations.This paper presents an interval approach for the treatment of parameter uncertainty for linear static structural mechanics problems. Uncertain parameters are introduced in the form of unknown but bounded quantities (intervals). Interval analysis is applied to the Finite Element Method (FEM) to analyze the system response due to uncertain stiffness and loading.To avoid overestimation, the formulation is based on an element-by-element (EBE) technique. Element matrices are formulated, based on the physics of materials, and the Lagrange multiplier method is applied to impose the necessary constraints for compatibility and equilibrium. Earlier EBE formulation provided sharp bounds only on displacements [32]. Based on the developed formulation, the bounds on the system’s displacements and element forces are obtained simultaneously and have the same level of accuracy. Very sharp enclosures for the exact system responses are obtained. A number of numerical examples are introduced, and scalability is illustrated.","Rafi L. Muhanna1, Hao Zhang1 & Robert L.

0,A cutting plane method for risk-constrained traveling salesman problem with random arc costs,"In this manuscript, we consider a stochastic traveling salesman problem with random arc costs and assume that the travel cost of each arc follows a normal distribution. All the other parameters in the problem are considered deterministic. In the presence of uncertainty, the optimal route achieved from solving the deterministic model might be exposed to a high risk that the actual cost exceeds the available resource. In this respect, we present the stochastic model incorporating risk management, and the Value at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk techniques are applied as the risk measures to assess and control the risk associated with the uncertainty. A novel cutting plane algorithm is developed to deal with the difficulty of solving such model, and exhibits superior computational performance in our numerical experiments over other solution approaches.","Zhouchun Huang1, Qipeng Phil Zheng2, Eduardo Pasiliao3, Vladimir Boginski2 & …Tao Zhang",Journal of Global Optimization,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-018-0708-0,"Conditional Value At Risk (CVaR),CP Algorithm,CVaR Constraint,Total Travel Cost,Second-order Cone Problem (SOCPs)"

0,Probabilities of Pure Nash Equilibria in Matrix Games when the Payoff Entries of One Player Are Randomly Selected,"
The Nash equilibrium in pure strategies represents an important solution concept in nonzero sum matrix games. Existence of Nash equilibria in games with known and with randomly selected payoff entries have been studied extensively. In many real games, however, a player may know his own payoff entries but not the payoff entries of the other player. In this paper, we consider nonzero sum matrix games where the payoff entries of one player are known, but the payoff entries of the other player are assumed to be randomly selected. We are interested in determining the probabilities of existence of pure Nash equilibria in such games. We characterize these probabilities by first determining the finite space of ordinal matrix games that corresponds to the infinite space of matrix games with random entries for only one player. We then partition this space into mutually exclusive spaces that correspond to games with no Nash equilibria and with r Nash equilibria. In order to effectively compute the sizes of these spaces, we introduce the concept of top-rated preferences minimal ordinal games. We then present a theorem which provides a mechanism for computing the number of games in each of these mutually exclusive spaces, which then can be used to determine the probabilities. Finally, we summarize the results by deriving the probabilities of existence of unique, nonunique, and no Nash equilibria, and we present an illustrative example.

0,Heuristic strategies for assessing wireless sensor network resiliency: an event-based formal approach,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly being adopted in critical applications. In these networks undesired events may undermine the reliability level; thus their effects need to be properly assessed from the early stages of the development process onwards to minimize the chances of unexpected problems during use. In this paper we propose two heuristic strategies: what-if analysis and robustness checking. They allow to drive designers towards optimal WSN deployment solutions, from the point of view of the connection and data delivery resiliency, exploiting a formal approach based on the event calculus formal language. The heuristics are backed up by a support tool aimed to simplify their adoption by system designers. The tool allows to specify the target WSN in a user-friendly way and it is able to elaborate the two heuristic strategies by means of the event calculus specifications automatically generated. The WSN reliability is assessed computing a set of specific metrics. The effectiveness of the strategies is shown in the context of three case studies.","Alessandro Testa1, Marcello Cinque2, Antonio Coronato1, Giuseppe De Pietro1 & …Juan Carlos Augusto",Journal of Heuristics,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10732-014-9258-x,"Wireless sensor networks,Heuristic,Resiliency ,Formal language,Robustness checking"

0,Stochastic Collocation Method for Stochastic Optimal Boundary Control of the Navier–Stokes Equations,"We consider the optimal control of a system governed by the Navier–Stokes equations with stochastic Dirichlet boundary conditions. Control conditions imposed only on the boundary are associated with reduced regularity of the system, as compared to distributed controls. To ensure the well-posedness of the solutions and the efficiency of numerical simulations, the stochastic boundary conditions and controls are required to belong almost surely to the Sobolev space of functions having first order weak derivative along the boundary. To simulate the system, numerical solutions are approximated using the stochastic collocation/finite element approach with sparse grid techniques and Monte Carlo methods which are applied to the boundary random field. An optimality system is derived for a matching-type cost functional. Error estimates are derived for the optimal state, the adjoint state and boundary control variables. Numerical examples for the deterministic cases are provided and compared in which the controls are applied on a part of or on the whole boundary. Simulations for the stochastic cases are also made with sparse grid and Monte Carlo methods to retrieve the statistical information of the optimal solution.","Wenju Zhao

0,Dangerous connections: on binding site models of infectious disease dynamics,"We formulate models for the spread of infection on networks that are amenable to analysis in the large population limit. We distinguish three different levels: (1) binding sites, (2) individuals, and (3) the population. In the tradition of physiologically structured population models, the formulation starts on the individual level. Influences from the ‘outside world’ on an individual are captured by environmental variables. These environmental variables are population level quantities. A key characteristic of the network models is that individuals can be decomposed into a number of conditionally independent components: each individual has a fixed number of ‘binding sites’ for partners. The Markov chain dynamics of binding sites are described by only a few equations. In particular, individual-level probabilities are obtained from binding-site-level probabilities by combinatorics while population-level quantities are obtained by averaging over individuals in the population. Thus we are able to characterize population-level epidemiological quantities, such as \(R_0\), r, the final size, and the endemic equilibrium, in terms of the corresponding variables.","Ka Yin Leung

their barycentres and their entropy production functional. The framework
is remarkably encompassing as it implies many old geometric - Gaussian

such inequalities also lead to exponential rates of convergence to equilibria
for solutions of Fokker-Planck and McKean-Vlasov type equations. The

Such functions arise naturally in theoretical computer science, combinatorics, and the theory of social choice. It is often interesting to understand when these functions essentially depend on few coordinates. Our main result is a dichotomy that includes a lower bound on how fast the Fourier coefficients of such functions can decay: we show that

0,Evolutionary stability is sensitive on the conflict between reproduction and survival: proofs,"Evolutionary game theory is a powerful mathematical framework to study how phenotypes evolve by natural selection. Both birth and death are key in classic models in evolutionary games. The conflict between the two is fundamental in life history theory. The conflict between birth and death has been shown to change the evolutionary outcome for continuous traits. However, it is not clear how the conflict reshapes the evolutionary outcome for discrete strategies. An allocation model is proposed, in which part of the payoff is mapped to reproduction and the rest is mapped to illness. For non-evolving allocation, it is proved that the allocation does not change the fixation probability if and only if the illness is an inverse exponential function and the product of reproduction function and illness function is a constant. The necessary and sufficient condition implies that the allocation dramatically alters the evolutionary stability for a wide class of evolutionary processes. This is also verified by alternative construction proofs and numerical examples. Furthermore, the illness and reproduction function also ensures that every allocation is a neutral stable regime, if the allocation evolves to maximize the invasion probability. A deviation can lead to a non-trivial evolutionary branching. These results explicitly show that the reproduction and illness functions are restrictive to ensure the invariance of evolutionary outcome. Thus it implies that the demographic and life history need to be considered together to understand patterns of evolutionary dynamics.

0,A probabilistic interpretation and stochastic particle approximations of the 3-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations,"We develop a probabilistic interpretation of local mild solutions of the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equation in the L
p spaces, when the initial vorticity field is integrable. This is done by associating a generalized nonlinear diffusion of the McKean-Vlasov type with the solution of the corresponding vortex equation. We then construct trajectorial (chaotic) stochastic particle approximations of this nonlinear process. These results provide the first complete proof of convergence of a stochastic vortex method for the Navier-Stokes equation in three dimensions, and rectify the algorithm conjectured by Esposito and Pulvirenti in 1989. Our techniques rely on a fine regularity study of the vortex equation in the supercritical L
p spaces, and on an extension of the classic McKean-Vlasov model, which incorporates the derivative of the stochastic flow of the nonlinear process to explain the vortex stretching phenomenon proper to dimension three.","J.

Inspired by the famous Hayashi–Yoshida estimator for the quadratic covariation based on two asynchronously observed stochastic processes, we investigate similar sums for general functionals. We find that our results differ from corresponding results for synchronous observations, a case which has been well studied in the literature, and we observe that the asymptotic behaviour in the setting of asynchronous observations is not only determined by the nature of the functional, but also depends crucially on the asymptotics of the observation scheme.

0,Iterative Computation of Security Strategies of Matrix Games with Growing Action Set,"This paper studies how to efficiently update the saddle-point strategy, or security strategy of one player in a matrix game when the other player develops new actions in the game. It is well known that the saddle-point strategy of one player can be computed by solving a linear program. Developing a new action will add a new constraint to the existing LP. Therefore, our problem becomes how to efficiently solve the new LP with a new constraint. Considering the potentially huge number of constraints, which corresponds to the large size of the other player’s action set, we use the shadow vertex simplex method, whose computational complexity is lower than linear with respect to the size of the constraints, as the basis of our iterative algorithm. We first rebuild the main theorems in the shadow vertex method with a relaxed non-degeneracy assumption to make sure such a method works well in our model, then analyze the probability that the old optimum remains optimal in the new LP, and finally provide the iterative shadow vertex method whose average computational complexity is shown to be strictly less than that of the shadow vertex method. The simulation results demonstrate our main results about the probability of re-computing the optimum and the computational complexity of the iterative shadow vertex method.","Lichun Li

0,On the existence of regular conditional probabilities,"Let (X, A, P) be a measure space with P(X)=1 and ∇ a sub-σ-algebra. It is well known (see e.g. Doob, p. 624) that even if A is separable, a regular conditional probability (r.c.p.) on A, given ∇, does not always exist. All theorems assuring the existence of a r.c.p. known hitherto use in addition to the separability of A conditions of an essentially topological nature such as compact approximation (for references see e.g. Pfanzagl-Pierlo (1966), section 7).It is the purpose of this paper to explore the possibility of sufficient conditions of a purely measure-theoretic nature. Without loss of generality we may assume that (X, A, P) is complete and ∇ is complete with respect to P ¦A. For many applications it will be sufficient to have the r.c.p. defined on a sub-σ-algebra A
0 ⊂ A with A
0 ~ A(P|A) rather than on the whole σ-algebra A. It will be shown that a r.c.p. in this more restricted sense always exists if A is the completion of a separable σ-algebra and if it contains a P-null set of the power of the continuum. The “P-null-set” -condition cannot be omitted without any replacements. To be more specific: Even a r.c.p. in the restricted sense does not necessarily exist if A is the completion of a separable σ-algebra (see Example 1). Furthermore, there are instances, in which a r.c.p. in the restricted sense exists but a r.c.p. in the usual sense does not exist (see Example 2).Even if a r.c.p. exists, it is not necessarily proper. The deep study by Blackwell and Ryll-Nardzewski (1963) reveals that this negative statement even holds under rather restrictive conditions (X = complete separable metric space, A = Borel algebra of X). It therefore seems to be of some interest to state that the r.c.p. in the restricted sense can always be chosen such that it is proper with respect to some sub-σ-algebra +Bo +(+B ∩A

0,Limits of multiplicative inhomogeneous random graphs and Lévy trees: limit theorems,"We consider a natural model of inhomogeneous random graphs that extends the classical Erdős–Rényi graphs and shares a close connection with the multiplicative coalescence, as pointed out by Aldous (Ann Probab 25:812–854, 1997). In this model, the vertices are assigned weights that govern their tendency to form edges. It is by looking at the asymptotic distributions of the masses (sum of the weights) of the connected components of these graphs that Aldous and Limic (Electron J Probab 3:1–59, 1998) have identified the entrance boundary of the multiplicative coalescence, which is intimately related to the excursion lengths of certain Lévy-type processes. We, instead, look at the metric structure of these components and prove their Gromov–Hausdorff–Prokhorov convergence to a class of (random) compact measured metric spaces that have been introduced in a companion paper (Broutin et al. in Limits of multiplicative inhomogeneous random graphs and Lévy trees: the continuum graphs. arXiv:1804.05871, 2020). Our asymptotic regimes relate directly to the general convergence condition appearing in the work of Aldous and Limic. Our techniques provide a unified approach for this general “critical” regime, and relies upon two key ingredients: an encoding of the graph by some Lévy process as well as an embedding of its connected components into Galton–Watson forests. This embedding transfers asymptotically into an embedding of the limit objects into a forest of Lévy trees, which allows us to give an explicit construction of the limit objects from the excursions of the Lévy-type process. The mains results combined with the ones in the other paper allow us to extend and complement several previous results that had been obtained via model- or regime-specific proofs, for instance: the case of Erdős–Rényi random graphs obtained by Addario-Berry et al.

Continuous-time Markov (CTM) approach was adopted to build the dynamic model of the crop growth system and the simulated numerical method. The growth rate responses to the variation of the external force and the change of biomass saturation value were studied. The crop grew in the semiarid area was taken as an example to carry out the numerical simulation analysis, therefore the results provide the quantity basis for the field management. Comparing the dynamic model with the other plant growth model, the superiority of the former is that it displays multi-dimension of resource utilization by means of combining macroscopic with microcosmic and reveals the process of resource transition. The simulation method of crop growth system is advanced and manipulated.

0,Probabilistic Approach for Predicting Periodic Orbits in Piecewise Affine Differential Models,"Piecewise affine models provide a qualitative description of the dynamics of a system, and are often used to study genetic regulatory networks. The state space of a piecewise affine system is partitioned into hyperrectangles, which can be represented as nodes in a directed graph, so that the system’s trajectories follow a path in a transition graph.This paper proposes and compares two definitions of probability of transition between two nodes A and B of the graph, based on the volume of the initial conditions on the hyperrectangle A whose trajectories cross to B. The parameters of the system can thus be compared to the observed transitions between two hyperrectangles. This property may become useful to identify sets of parameters for which the system yields a desired periodic orbit with a high probability, or to predict the most likely periodic orbit given a set of parameters, as illustrated by a gene regulatory system composed of two intertwined negative loops.","Madalena Chaves1, Etienne Farcot2 & Jean-Luc Gouzé",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-012-9773-6,"Piecewise affine models,Genetic networks"
0,Trait Substitution Sequence process and Canonical Equation for age-structured populations,"We are interested in a stochastic model of trait and age-structured population undergoing mutation and selection. We start with a continuous time, discrete individual-centered population process. Taking the large population and rare mutations limits under a well-chosen time-scale separation condition, we obtain a jump process that generalizes the Trait Substitution Sequence process describing Adaptive Dynamics for populations without age structure. Under the additional assumption of small mutations, we derive an age-dependent ordinary differential equation that extends the Canonical Equation. These evolutionary approximations have never been introduced to our knowledge. They are based on ecological phenomena represented by PDEs that generalize the Gurtin–McCamy equation in Demography. Another particularity is that they involve an establishment probability, describing the probability of invasion of the resident population by the mutant one, that cannot always be computed explicitly. Examples illustrate how adding an age-structure enrich the modelling of structured population by including life history features such as senescence. In the cases considered, we establish the evolutionary approximations and study their long time behavior and the nature of their evolutionary singularities when computation is tractable.

0,On the comparison of initialisation strategies in differential evolution for large scale optimisation,"
Differential Evolution (de) has shown to be a promising global optimisation solver for continuous problems, even for those with a large dimensionality. Different previous works have studied the effects that a population initialisation strategy has on the performance of de when solving large scale continuous problems, and several contradictions have appeared with respect to the benefits that a particular initialisation scheme might provide. Some works have claimed that by applying a particular approach to a given problem, the performance of de is going to be better than using others. In other cases however, researchers have stated that the overall performance of de is not going to be affected by the use of a particular initialisation method. In this work, we study a wide range of well-known initialisation techniques for de. Taking into account the best and worst results, statistically significant differences among considered initialisation strategies appeared. Thus, with the aim of increasing the probability of appearance of high-quality results and/or reducing the probability of appearance of low-quality ones, a suitable initialisation strategy, which depends on the large scale problem being solved, should be selected.","Eduardo Segredo

A positioning technique determines for every program item, (instruction or data), its address in main memory.Assuming the Independent Reference Model, we break the general positioning problem into two, the collision minimization and the grouping problems and show optimal algorithms for both problems. Using these algorithms we derive an optimal algorithm for the general positioning problem.Since the optimal positioning is of very special structure we consider other, less restricted, positionings. We show that the quality of a class of natural assignments that distribute the items almost arbitrarily is good as long as the optimal hit ratio is sufficiently large. Another possible requirement is that the items should be distributed as evenly as possible. We find an optimal assignment for the special case of the pair assignment.In addition we look at the expected performance gain of two frequently suggested cache features. The cache bypass feature supports the access of items in memory without loading the item into the cache. We show an assignment with best possible hit ratio. Also it is shown that a cache which employs a random assignment policy, i.e., the assignment of an item is determined randomly, does not improve the expected hit ratio.","S. Gal1, Y. Hollander2 & A.

0,"Distributionally robust optimization with polynomial densities: theory, models and algorithms","In distributionally robust optimization the probability distribution of the uncertain problem parameters is itself uncertain, and a fictitious adversary, e.g., nature, chooses the worst distribution from within a known ambiguity set. A common shortcoming of most existing distributionally robust optimization models is that their ambiguity sets contain pathological discrete distributions that give nature too much freedom to inflict damage. We thus introduce a new class of ambiguity sets that contain only distributions with sum-of-squares (SOS) polynomial density functions of known degrees. We show that these ambiguity sets are highly expressive as they conveniently accommodate distributional information about higher-order moments, conditional probabilities, conditional moments or marginal distributions. Exploiting the theoretical properties of a measure-based hierarchy for polynomial optimization due to Lasserre (SIAM J Optim 21(3):864–885, 2011), we prove that certain worst-case expectation constraints are polynomial-time solvable under these new ambiguity sets. We also show how SOS densities can be used to approximately solve the general problem of moments. We showcase the applicability of the proposed approach in the context of a stylized portfolio optimization problem and a risk aggregation problem of an insurance company.","Etienne de Klerk1, Daniel Kuhn

0,Stochasticity and noise-induced transition of genetic toggle switch,"The ability to predict and analyze the function of genetic circuits will enhance the design of autonomous, programmable, complex regulatory genetic structures. An abundance of modeling techniques has recently been developed to delineate simple genetic structures in terms of their constituents. Simple systems with characteristics of feedback inhibition, multi-stability, switching, and oscillatory expression have often been the focus. The present work is an attempt to improve existing deterministic models that fail to oblige to the crucial aspect of noise in genetic modeling.The objective of this work is to analyze, model, and simulate the protein populations in gene expression mechanisms by resorting to stochastic algorithms. The system involves two types of genes; the protein produced from the expression of one gene is capable of turning off the expression of the other gene. Rates of degradation of these proteins are assumed to be proportional to their concentrations. The master equation of this ‘genetic toggle switch’ is formulated using the probabilistic population balance around a particular state and by considering five mutually exclusive events. The efficacy of the present methodology is mainly attributable to the ability to derive the governing equations for the means, variances, and covariance of the random variables by the method of system-size expansion of the nonlinear master Equation. A less laborious approach based on Kurtz’s limit theorems for the derivation of the stochastic characteristics is also presented for comparison. Solving the resultant ordinary differential equations governing the means, variances, and covariance of the master equations simultaneously using the published data yield information concerning not only the means of the two populations of proteins but also the minimal uncertainties of the populations inherent in the expressions. It is demonstrated that systems with small populations are susceptible to large internal fluctuations (or uncertainties) in their population evolution. Large uncertainties are observed after the populations enter the proximity of the saddle node, which is likely to cause transition of system’s steady state from one to another. Independent Monte-Carlo simulation runs clearly demonstrates that the occurrence of such internal noise-induced transition.",Wei-Yin Chen,Journal of Uncertainty Analysis and Applications,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2195-5468-2-1,"Stochastic,Nonlinear,Model,Genetic networks,Genetic circuits,Metastable,Noise-induced transitions"

0,Aspiration Can Promote Cooperation in Well-Mixed Populations As in Regular Graphs,"Classical studies on aspiration-based dynamics suggest that dissatisfied individuals switch their strategies without taking into account the success of others. The imitation-based dynamics allow individuals to imitate successful strategies without taking into account their own-satisfactions. In this article, we propose to study a dynamic based on aspiration, which takes into account imitation of successful strategies for dissatisfied individuals. Individuals compare their success to their aspired levels. This mechanism helps individuals with a minimum of self-satisfaction to maintain their strategies. Dissatisfied individuals will learn from their neighbors by choosing the successful strategies. We derive an exact expression of the fixation probability in well-mixed populations as in graph-structured populations. As a result, we show that weak selection favors the evolution of cooperation if the difference in aspired level exceeds some crucial value. Increasing the aspired level of cooperation should oppose cooperative behavior while increasing the aspired level of defection should promote cooperative behavior. We show that the cooperation level decreases as the connectivity increases. The best scenario for the cooperative evolution is a graph with a small connectivity, while the worst scenario is a well-mixed population.","Dhaker Kroumi

0,Estimating the latent time of fault detection in finite automaton tested in real time,"The notions of potential and real latent times of fault detection in finite automata were introduced. The potential latent time is the minimal theoretical time of automaton fault detection, the real time is defined as the time of fault manifestation at a certain point. A method for determination of the statistical characteristics of both times for the automaton tested in the course of its real operation was proposed. It is based on selection of the trajectories of the Markov chain describing behavior of the operable and faulty automata. Additionally, a method for determination of the upper bound of the mean latent time in the case of limited information about the automaton characteristics was proposed.",R. Goot1 & I.

0,Edge-Based Compartmental Modelling of an SIR Epidemic on a Dual-Layer Static–Dynamic Multiplex Network with Tunable Clustering,"The duration, type and structure of connections between individuals in real-world populations play a crucial role in how diseases invade and spread. Here, we incorporate the aforementioned heterogeneities into a model by considering a dual-layer static–dynamic multiplex network. The static network layer affords tunable clustering and describes an individual’s permanent community structure. The dynamic network layer describes the transient connections an individual makes with members of the wider population by imposing constant edge rewiring. We follow the edge-based compartmental modelling approach to derive equations describing the evolution of a susceptible–infected–recovered epidemic spreading through this multiplex network of individuals. We derive the basic reproduction number, measuring the expected number of new infectious cases caused by a single infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population. We validate model equations by showing convergence to pre-existing edge-based compartmental model equations in limiting cases and by comparison with stochastically simulated epidemics. We explore the effects of altering model parameters and multiplex network attributes on resultant epidemic dynamics. We validate the basic reproduction number by plotting its value against associated final epidemic sizes measured from simulation and predicted by model equations for a number of set-ups. Further, we explore the effect of varying individual model parameters on the basic reproduction number. We conclude with a discussion of the significance and interpretation of the model and its relation to existing research literature. We highlight intrinsic limitations and potential extensions of the present model and outline future research considerations, both experimental and theoretical.","Rosanna C. Barnard

0,Considering spatial memory to estimate seismic risk: the case of the Azores Archipelago,"This study aims to include the “epicentre migration” effect over time in the seismic occurrence process and subsequently in the assessment of seismic hazard and risk within a region. This epicentre migration phenomenon reflects the transfer of stress among different seismic zones. This study statistically quantifies how epicentres migrate among seismic zones, and a statistical measure was proposed to evaluate this influence. Traditionally, the location of the next earthquake is considered independent of the locations of previous events. However, seismic records reveal the existence of “spatial memory”. Our objective is to statistically quantify this memory. We used data from the Azores region to investigate this phenomenon because seismic zones have already been defined for this region. These zones are the “units” to and from which successive events migrate. Markov chains were used to model the sequence of seismic events over time. A one-step transition of the spatial variable (the seismic zone of an earthquake) was studied, revealing an evident spatial dependence between consecutive occurrences. For the case of a stationary Markovian process, two-step, …, N-step transitions were also considered, but a clear attenuation of spatial memory over time was observed as we moved to higher-order step transitions. This reveals that the methodology presented herein is especially useful in the assessment of seismic risk in the short or medium term. Only epicentral migration was analysed in this study, irrespective of the magnitudes and times between events. Time and magnitude variables will be incorporated into future studies given that the time, location and magnitude of an event are not independent and need to be studied together.

0,Oracle Complexity Separation in Convex Optimization,"Many convex optimization problems have structured objective functions written as a sum of functions with different oracle types (e.g., full gradient, coordinate derivative, stochastic gradient) and different arithmetic operations complexity of these oracles. In the strongly convex case, these functions also have different condition numbers that eventually define the iteration complexity of first-order methods and the number of oracle calls required to achieve a given accuracy. Motivated by the desire to call more expensive oracles fewer times, we consider the problem of minimizing the sum of two functions and propose a generic algorithmic framework to separate oracle complexities for each function. The latter means that the oracle for each function is called the number of times that coincide with the oracle complexity for the case when the second function is absent. Our general accelerated framework covers the setting of (strongly) convex objectives, the setting when both parts are given through full coordinate oracle, as well as when one of them is given by coordinate derivative oracle or has the finite-sum structure and is available through stochastic gradient oracle. In the latter two cases, we obtain accelerated random coordinate descent and accelerated variance reduced methods with oracle complexity separation.","Anastasiya Ivanova1,2, Pavel Dvurechensky3, Evgeniya Vorontsova

0,Fractional Poisson–Nernst–Planck Model for Ion Channels I: Basic Formulations and Algorithms,"In this work, we propose a fractional Poisson–Nernst–Planck model to describe ion permeation in gated ion channels. Due to the intrinsic conformational changes, crowdedness in narrow channel pores, binding and trapping introduced by functioning units of channel proteins, ionic transport in the channel exhibits a power-law-like anomalous diffusion dynamics. We start from continuous-time random walk model for a single ion and use a long-tailed density distribution function for the particle jump waiting time, to derive the fractional Fokker–Planck equation. Then, it is generalized to the macroscopic fractional Poisson–Nernst–Planck model for ionic concentrations. Necessary computational algorithms are designed to implement numerical simulations for the proposed model, and the dynamics of gating current is investigated. Numerical simulations show that the fractional PNP model provides a more qualitatively reasonable match to the profile of gating currents from experimental observations. Meanwhile, the proposed model motivates new challenges in terms of mathematical modeling and computations.","Duan Chen

We consider epidemics on social networks and address the question of whether administering a safe vaccine to one or more individuals can raise another individual’s chances of becoming infected. Surprisingly, this can happen if transmission probabilities vary over time. If transmission probabilities do not vary with time, we show that in the discrete SIR model vaccination cannot cause collateral damage. We phrase this question in terms of monotonicity properties and answer it using bond percolation methods. By passing to a covering graph we are able to extend these results to models with more complicated latent and infective states.

0,Duality and martingales: a stochastic programming perspective on contingent claims,"The hedging of contingent claims in the discrete time, discrete state case is analyzed from the perspective of modeling the hedging problem as a stochastic program. Application of conjugate duality leads to the arbitrage pricing theorems of financial mathematics, namely the equivalence of absence of arbitrage and the existence of a probability measure that makes the price process into a martingale. The model easily extends to the analysis of options pricing when modeling risk management concerns and the impact of spreads and margin requirements for writers of contingent claims. However, we find that arbitrage pricing in incomplete markets fails to model incentives to buy or sell options. An extension of the model to incorporate pre-existing liabilities and endowments reveals the reasons why buyers and sellers trade in options. The model also indicates the importance of financial equilibrium analysis for the understanding of options prices in incomplete markets.",Alan J.

In particular, we prove that the set L of extensions of limiting relative frequency is a proper subset of the set S of shift-invariant measures and that S is a proper subset of the set R of measures which map residue classes uniformly. Moreover, we show that there are subsets G of ℕ for which the range of possible values μ(G) for μ∈L is properly contained in the set of values obtained when μ ranges over S, and that there are subsets G which distinguish S and R analogously.

This is an ordinary differential equation that describes the type distribution (forward in time) in a population of infinite size. This paper establishes ancestral (random) structures inherent in this deterministic model. In a first step, we obtain a representation of the deterministic equation’s solution (and, in particular, of its equilibria) in terms of an ancestral process called the killed ancestral selection graph. This representation allows one to understand the bifurcations related to the error threshold phenomenon from a genealogical point of view. Next, we characterise the ancestral type distribution by means of the pruned lookdown ancestral selection graph and study its properties at equilibrium.

0,Optimal scaling of the MALA algorithm with irreversible proposals for Gaussian targets,"It is well known in many settings that reversible Langevin diffusions in confining potentials converge to equilibrium exponentially fast. Adding irreversible perturbations to the drift of a Langevin diffusion that maintain the same invariant measure accelerates its convergence to stationarity. Many existing works thus advocate the use of such non-reversible dynamics for sampling. When implementing Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms (MCMC) using time discretisations of such Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), one can append the discretization with the usual Metropolis–Hastings accept–reject step and this is often done in practice because the accept–reject step eliminates bias. On the other hand, such a step makes the resulting chain reversible. It is not known whether adding the accept–reject step preserves the faster mixing properties of the non-reversible dynamics. In this paper, we address this gap between theory and practice by analyzing the optimal scaling of MCMC algorithms constructed from proposal moves that are time-step Euler discretisations of an irreversible SDE, for high dimensional Gaussian target measures. We call the resulting algorithm the ipMALA , in comparison to the classical MALA algorithm (here ip is for irreversible proposal). In order to quantify how the cost of the algorithm scales with the dimension N, we prove invariance principles for the appropriately rescaled chain. In contrast to the usual MALA algorithm, we show that there could be two regimes asymptotically: (i) a diffusive regime, as in the MALA algorithm and (ii) a “fluid” regime where the limit is an ordinary differential equation. We provide concrete examples where the limit is a diffusion, as in the standard MALA, but with provably higher limiting acceptance probabilities. Numerical results are also given corroborating the theory.","Michela Ottobre1, Natesh S.

Discrete-time partially observed linear systems perturbed by stochastic unbounded additive disturbances are studied. Unlike the classic theory, the sensor signals are communicated to the estimator over a limited capacity noisy digital link modeled as a stochastic discrete memoryless channel. It is shown that the capability of the noisy channel to ensure state estimation with a bounded in probability error is identical to its capability to transmit information with as small probability of error as desired. In other words, the classic Shannon capacity of the channel constitutes the boundary of the observability domain. It is shown that whenever the Shannon capacity bound is met, a reliable observation can be ensured by means of a state estimator consuming a bounded (as time progresses) computational complexity and memory per unit time. The corresponding state estimator is constructed explicitly and is based on the classic block coding approach, so that traditional block encoding–decoding procedures can be employed for its implementation.",Alexey S.

0,Modeling and control of switching max-plus-linear systems with random and deterministic switching,"Switching max-plus-linear (SMPL) systems are discrete-event systems that can switch between different modes of operation. In each mode the system is described by a max-plus-linear state equation and a max-plus-linear output equation, with different system matrices for each mode. The switching may depend on the inputs and the states, or it may be a stochastic process. In this paper two equivalent descriptions for switching max-plus-linear systems will be discussed. We will also show that a switching max-plus-linear system can be written as a piecewise affine system or as a constrained max-min-plus-scaling system. The last translation can be established under (rather mild) additional assumptions on the boundedness of the states and the inputs. We also develop a stabilizing model predictive controller for SMPL systems with deterministic and/or stochastic switching. In general, the optimization in the model predictive control approach then boils down to a nonlinear nonconvex optimization problem, where the cost criterion is piecewise polynomial on polyhedral sets and the inequality constraints are linear.

For both these ciphers we report new perfectly periodic (iterative) aggregated differential attacks which propagate with quite high probabilities.The first cipher we look at is GOST, a well-known Russian government encryption standard. The second cipher we look at is PP-1, a very recent Polish block cipher. Both ciphers were designed to withstand linear and differential cryptanalysis. Unhappily, both ciphers are shown to be much weaker than expected against advanced differential attacks. For GOST, we report better and stronger sets of differentials than the best currently known attacks presented at SAC 2000 [32] and propose the first attack ever able to distinguish 16 rounds of GOST from random permutation.

Provided that intercrossing times have proper moments (higher, than of the first order), the problem of uniform-in-time comparison is reduced (using renewal-type arguments) to obtaining comparison estimates over finite horizons only.

0,Survival and extinction results for a patch model with sexual reproduction,"We consider a version of the contact process with sexual reproduction on a graph with two levels of interactions modeling metapopulations. The population is spatially distributed into patches and offspring are produced in each patch at a rate proportional to the number of pairs of individuals in the patch (sexual reproduction) rather than simply the number of individuals as in the basic contact process. Offspring produced at a given patch either stay in their parents’ patch or are sent to a nearby patch with some fixed probabilities. As the patch size tends to infinity, we identify a mean-field limit consisting of an infinite set of coupled differential equations. For the mean-field equations, we find explicit conditions for survival and extinction that we call expansion and retreat. Using duality techniques to compare the stochastic model to its mean-field limit, we find that expansion and retreat are also precisely the conditions needed to ensure survival and extinction of the stochastic model when the patch size is large. In addition, we study the dependence of survival on the dispersal range. We find that, with probability close to one and for a certain set of parameters, the metapopulation survives in the presence of nearest neighbor interactions while it dies out in the presence of long range interactions, suggesting that the best strategy for the population to spread in space is to use intermediate dispersal ranges.","Eric Foxall1,2 & Nicolas Lanchier",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-016-1058-5,"Interacting particle system,Block construction,Duality,Metapopulation,Allee effect"

GI/M/1 type queueing-inventory systems with postponed work, reservation, cancellation and common life time","In this paper we analyze two single server queueing-inventory systems in which items in the inventory have a random common life time. On realization of common life time, all customers in the system are flushed out. Subsequently the inventory reaches its maximum level S through a (positive lead time) replenishment for the next cycle which follows an exponential distribution. Through cancellation of purchases, inventory gets added until their expiry time; where cancellation time follows exponential distribution. Customers arrive according to a Poisson process and service time is exponentially distributed. On arrival if a customer finds the server busy, then he joins a buffer of varying size. If there is no inventory, the arriving customer first try to queue up in a finite waiting room of capacity K. Finding that at full, he joins a pool of infinite capacity with probability γ (0 < γ < 1); else it is lost to the system forever. We discuss two models based on ‘transfer’ of customers from the pool to the waiting room / buffer. In Model 1 when, at a service completion epoch the waiting room size drops to preassigned number L − 1 (1 < L < K) or below, a customer is transferred from pool to waiting room with probability p (0 < p < 1) and positioned as the last among the waiting customers. If at a departure epoch the waiting room turns out to be empty and there is at least one customer in the pool, then the one ahead of all waiting in the pool gets transferred to the waiting room with probability one. We introduce a totally different transfer mechanism in Model 2: when at a service completion epoch, the server turns idle with at least one item in the inventory, the pooled customer is immediately taken for service. At the time of a cancellation if the server is idle with none, one or more customers in the waiting room, then the head of the pooled customer go to the buffer directly for service. Also we assume that no customer joins the system when there is no item in the inventory. Several system performance measures are obtained. A cost function is discussed for each model and some numerical illustrations are presented. Finally a comparison of the two models are made.","A. Krishnamoorthy1, Dhanya Shajin1 & B.

0,Low-dimensional offshore wave input for extreme event quantification,"In offshore engineering design, nonlinear wave models are often used to propagate stochastic waves from an input boundary to the location of an offshore structure. Each wave realization is typically characterized by a high-dimensional input time-series, and a reliable determination of the extreme events is associated with substantial computational effort. As the sea depth decreases, extreme events become more difficult to evaluate. We here construct a low-dimensional characterization of the candidate input time series to circumvent the search for extreme wave events in a high-dimensional input probability space. Each wave input is represented by a unique low-dimensional set of parameters for which standard surrogate approximations, such as Gaussian processes, can estimate the short-term exceedance probability efficiently and accurately. We demonstrate the advantages of the new approach with a simple shallow-water wave model based on the Korteweg–de Vries equation for which we can provide an accurate reference solution based on the simple Monte Carlo method. We furthermore apply the method to a fully nonlinear wave model for wave propagation over a sloping seabed. The results demonstrate that the Gaussian process can learn accurately the tail of the heavy-tailed distribution of the maximum wave crest elevation based on only \(1.7\%\) of the required Monte Carlo evaluations.","Kenan Šehić

0,Impact of Imitation Processes on the Effectiveness of Ring Vaccination,"Ring vaccination can be a highly effective control strategy for an emerging disease or in the final phase of disease eradication, as witnessed in the eradication of smallpox. However, the impact of behavioural dynamics on the effectiveness of ring vaccination has not been explored in mathematical models. Here, we analyze a series of stochastic models of voluntary ring vaccination. Contacts of an index case base vaccinating decisions on their own individual payoffs to vaccinate or not vaccinate, and they can also imitate the behaviour of other contacts of the index case. We find that including imitation changes the probability of containment through ring vaccination considerably. Imitation can cause a strong majority of contacts to choose vaccination in some cases, or to choose non-vaccination in other cases—even when the equivalent solution under perfectly rational (non-imitative) behaviour yields mixed choices. Moreover, imitation processes can result in very different outcomes in different stochastic realizations sampled from the same parameter distributions, by magnifying moderate tendencies toward one behaviour or the other: in some realizations, imitation causes a strong majority of contacts not to vaccinate, while in others, imitation promotes vaccination and reduces the number of secondary infections. Hence, the effectiveness of ring vaccination can depend significantly and unpredictably on imitation processes. Therefore, our results suggest that risk communication efforts should be initiated early in an outbreak when ring vaccination is to be applied, especially among subpopulations that are heavily influenced by peer opinions.","Chad R.

0,Range reliability in random walks,"This paper introduces a definition of reliability based on a process range. Thus, process failure is defined when the range of a process first reaches a given and unacceptable level. The Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) which is denned as the mean of the first time for a range to attain a given amplitude is then calculated for an asymmetric random walk process. The probability distribution of the range is then given and the process reliability over long periods of system operations are then calculated. Applications such as the control of wings movements, stock price and exchange rates volatility (defined in terms of reliability) are also used to motivate the usefulness of range processes in reliability studies. Finally, we point out that there is necessarily a relationship between the range reliability and the propensity of a series to become chaotic.",Pierre Vallois1 & Charles S.

0,Moment Equations and Dynamics of a Household SIS Epidemiological Model,"An SIS epidemiological model of individuals partitioned into households is studied, where infections take place either within or between households, the latter generally happening much less frequently. The model is explored using stochastic spatial simulations, as well as mathematical models which consist of an infinite system of ordinary differential equations for the moments of the distribution describing the proportions of individuals who are infectious among households. Various moment-closure approximations are used to truncate the system of ODEs to finite systems of equations. These approximations can sometimes lead to a system of ill-behaved ODEs which predict moments which become negative or unbounded. A reparametrization of the ODEs is then developed, which forces all moments to satisfy necessary constraints.Changing the proportion of contacts within and between households does not change the endemic equilibrium, but does affect the amount of time it takes to approach the fixed point; increasing the proportion of contacts within households slows the spread of the infection toward endemic equilibrium. The system of moment equations does describe this phenomenon, although less accurately in the limit as the proportion of between-household contacts approaches zero. The results indicate that although controlling the movement of individuals does not affect the long-term frequency of an infection with SIS dynamics, it can have a large effect on the time-scale of the dynamics, which may provide an opportunity for other controls such as immunizations to be applied.",David Hiebeler,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-006-9080-1,"Epidemiological models,Moment-closure approximations,Spatial models"
0,Self-consistent Feedback Stackelberg Equilibria for Infinite Horizon Stochastic Games,"The paper introduces a concept of “self consistent” Stackelberg equilibria for stochastic games in infinite time horizon, where the two players adopt feedback strategies and have exponentially discounted costs. The analysis is focused on games in continuous time, described by a controlled Markov process with finite state space. Results on the existence and uniqueness of such solutions are provided. As an intermediate step, a detailed description of the structure of the best reply map is achieved, in a “generic” setting. Namely: for all games where the cost functions and the transition coefficients of the Markov chain lie in open dense subset of a suitable space \(\mathcal{C}^k\). Under generic assumptions, we prove that a self-consistent Stackelberg equilibrium exists, provided that either (i) the leader is far-sighted, i.e., his exponential discount factor is sufficiently small, or (ii) the follower is narrow-sighted, i.e., his discount factor is large enough.","Alberto Bressan

0,"To the History of the Appearance of the Notion of the ε-Entropy of an Authomorphism of a Lebesgue Space and (ε,T)-Entropy of a Dynamical System with Continuous Time","The paper is devoted to the master thesis on “information theory” which was written by the author in 1956–57. The topic was suggested by his advisor A. A. Bobrov (a student of A. Ya. Khinchin and A. N. Kolmogorov), and the thesis was written under the influence of lectures by N. I. Gavrilov (a student of I. G. Petrovskii) on the qualitative theory of differential equations, which included the statement of Birkhoff’s theorem for ergodic dynamical systems. In the thesis, the author used the concept of Shannon entropy in the study of ergodic dynamical systems f(p, t) in a separable compact metric space R with an invariant measure μ (where μ(R) = 1) and introduced the notion of the (ϵ, T)-entropy of a system as a quantitative characteristic of the degree of mixing. In the work, not only partitions of R were considered, but also partitions of the interval (−∞,∞) into subintervals of length T > 0. In particular, f(p, T) was regarded as an automorphism S of X = R, and the (ϵ, T)-entropy is essentially the ε-entropy of S. But, despite some “oversights” in the definition of the (ϵ, T)-entropy and many years that have passed, the author decided to publish the corresponding chapter of the thesis in connection with the following: 1) There is a number of papers that refer to this work in the explanation of the history of the concept of Kolmogorov’s entropy. 2) Recently, B. M. Gurevich obtained new results on the ϵ-entropy hϵ(S), which show that for two ergodic automorphisms with equal finite entropies their ϵ-entropies also coincide for all ϵ, but, on the other hand, there are unexpected nonergodic automorphisms with equal finite entropies, but different ϵ-entropies for some ϵ. This shows that the concept of ϵ-entropy is of scientific value.",D. Z.

In this paper, we develop Monte Carlo sampling-based procedures for assessing solution quality in stochastic programs. Quality is defined via the optimality gap and our procedures' output is a confidence interval on this gap. We review a multiple-replications procedure that requires solution of, say, 30 optimization problems and then, we present a result that justifies a computationally simplified single-replication procedure that only requires solving one optimization problem. Even though the single replication procedure is computationally significantly less demanding, the resulting confidence interval might have low coverage probability for small sample sizes for some problems. We provide variants of this procedure that require two replications instead of one and that perform better empirically. We present computational results for a newsvendor problem and for two-stage stochastic linear programs from the literature. We also discuss when the procedures perform well and when they fail, and we propose using ɛ-optimal solutions to strengthen the performance of our procedures.",Güzin Bayraksan1 & David P.

0,Strategy Selection in Evolutionary Game Dynamics on Group Interaction Networks,"Evolutionary game theory provides an appropriate tool for investigating the competition and diffusion of behavioral traits in biological or social populations. A core challenge in evolutionary game theory is the strategy selection problem: Given two strategies, which one is favored by the population? Recent studies suggest that the answer depends not only on the payoff functions of strategies but also on the interaction structure of the population. Group interactions are one of the fundamental interactive modes within populations. This work aims to investigate the strategy selection problem in evolutionary game dynamics on group interaction networks. In detail, the strategy selection conditions are obtained for some typical networks with group interactions. Furthermore, the obtained conditions are applied to investigate selection between cooperation and defection in populations. The conditions for evolution of cooperation are derived for both the public goods game and volunteer’s dilemma game. Numerical experiments validate the above analytical results.","Shaolin Tan1,2, Shasha Feng2,3, Pei Wang4 & …Yao Chen",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-014-0031-y,"Fixation probability,Structured population,Two-strategy game,Cooperation"

We give a number of different approaches of our generalisation. One partial proof uses an inductive method which we also apply to other problems. In particular, we give a formula for the distribution of the number of cycles over all products of cycles of fixed lengths.

0,The large-sample asymptotic behaviour of quartet-based summary methods for species tree inference,"Summary methods seek to infer a species tree from a set of gene trees. A desirable property of such methods is that of statistical consistency; that is, the probability of inferring the wrong species tree (the error probability) tends to 0 as the number of input gene trees becomes large. A popular paradigm is to infer a species tree that agrees with the maximum number of quartets from the input set of gene trees; this has been proved to be statistically consistent under several models of gene evolution. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the error probability of such methods in this limit, and show that it decays exponentially. For a 4-taxon species tree, we derive a closed form for the asymptotic behaviour in terms of the probability that the gene evolution process produces the correct topology. We also derive bounds for the sample complexity (the number of gene trees required to infer the true species tree with a given probability), which outperform existing bounds. We then extend our results to bounds for the asymptotic behaviour of the error probability for any species tree, and compare these to the true error probability for some model species trees using simulations.","Yao-ban Chan

In this article, we focus on a quantum detection problem, where the goal is to construct a tight frame that minimizes an error term, which in quantum physics has the interpretation of the probability of a detection error. The method converts the frame problem into a set of ordinary differential equations using concepts from classical mechanics and orthogonal group techniques. The minimum energy solutions of the differential equations are proven to correspond to the tight frames that minimize the error term. Because of this perspective, several numerical methods become available to compute the tight frames. Beyond the applications of quantum detection in quantum mechanics, solutions to this frame optimization problem can be viewed as a generalization of classical matched filtering solutions. As such, the methods we develop are a generalization of fundamental detection techniques in radar.",John J.

However in the real world there are many systems, whose economics depend on average availability of flow throughout the life span of the system rather than reliability on one particular threshold level only. Such systems exist in oil and gas redundant flow networks. To best of this author’s knowledge no attempt has been made yet to compute availability of such systems. Computing availability of flow is of utmost importance for the economical planning and design of any industrial flow networks. In this paper an approach is proposed to compute availability of flow in redundant flow systems.

The imprecise evaluations are represented by n-point intervals which are defined by the largest interval of possible evaluations and by its subintervals sequentially nested one in another. This sequence of subintervals is associated with an increasing sequence of plausibility, such that the plausibility of a subinterval is greater than the plausibility of the subinterval containing it. We explain the intuition that stands behind this proposal, and we show the advantage of n-point intervals compared to other methods dealing with imprecise evaluations. Although n-point intervals can be applied in any multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) method, in this paper, we focus on their application in robust ordinal regression which, unlike other MCDA methods, takes into account all compatible instances of an adopted preference model, which reproduce an indirect preference information provided by the decision maker.

0,A Probabilistic Analysis of the Power of Arithmetic Filters ," The assumption of real-number arithmetic, which is at the basis of conventional geometric algorithms, has been seriously challenged in recent years, since digital computers do not exhibit such capability. A geometric predicate usually consists of evaluating the sign of some algebraic expression. In most cases, rounded computations yield a reliable result, but sometimes rounded arithmetic introduces errors which may invalidate the algorithms. The rounded arithmetic may produce an incorrect result only if the exact absolute value of the algebraic expression is smaller than some (small) ε , which represents the largest error that may arise in the evaluation of the expression. The threshold ε  depends on the structure of the expression and on the adopted computer arithmetic, assuming that the input operands are error-free. A pair (arithmetic engine, threshold) is an arithmetic filter. In this paper we develop a general technique for assessing the efficacy of an arithmetic filter. The analysis consists of evaluating both the threshold and the probability of failure of the filter. To exemplify the approach, under the assumption that the input points be chosen randomly in a unit ball or unit cube with uniform density, we analyze the two important predicates ``which-side'' and ``insphere.'' We show that the probability that the absolute values of the corresponding determinants be no larger than some positive value V , with emphasis on small V , is Θ(V)  for the which-side predicate, while for the insphere predicate it is Θ(V

0,How local in time is the no-arbitrage property under capital gains taxes?,"In frictionless financial markets, no-arbitrage is a local property in time. This means that a discrete time model is arbitrage-free if and only if there does not exist a one-period-arbitrage. With capital gains taxes, this equivalence fails. For a model with a linear tax and one non-shortable risky stock, we introduce the concept of robust local no-arbitrage (RLNA) as the weakest local condition which guarantees dynamic no-arbitrage. Under a sharp dichotomy condition, we prove (RLNA). Since no-one-period-arbitrage is necessary for no-arbitrage, the latter is sandwiched between two local conditions, which allows us to estimate its non-locality. Furthermore, we construct a stock price process such that two long positions in the same stock hedge each other. This puzzling phenomenon that cannot occur in arbitrage-free frictionless markets (or markets with proportional transaction costs) is used to show that no-arbitrage alone does not imply the existence of an equivalent separating measure if the probability space is infinite. Finally, we show that the model with a linear tax on capital gains can be written as a model with proportional transaction costs by introducing several fictitious securities.","Christoph Kühn

0,Renewal-Reward Process Formulation of Motor Protein Dynamics,"Renewal-reward processes are used to provide a framework for the mathematical description of single-molecule bead-motor assays for processive motor proteins. The formulation provides a more powerful, general approach to the fluctuation analysis of bead-motor assays begun by Svoboda et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91(25):11782, 1994). Fluctuation analysis allows one to gain insight into the mechanochemical cycle of motor proteins purely by measuring the statistics of the displacement of the cargo (e.g., bead) the protein transports. The statistical parameters of interest are shown to be the steady-state slopes (in time) of the cumulants of the bead (the cumulant rates). The first two cumulant rates are the steady-state velocity and slope of the variance. The cumulant rates are shown to be insensitive to experimental disturbances such as the initial state of the enzyme and from the viewpoint of modeling, unaffected by substeps. Two existing models—Elston (J. Math. Biol. 41(3):189–206, 2000) and Peskin and Oster (Biophys. J. 68(4):202S–211S, 1995)—are formulated as renewal-reward processes to demonstrate the insight that the formulation affords. A key contribution of the approach is the possibility of accounting for wasted hydrolyses and backward steps in the fluctuation analysis. For example, the randomness parameter defined in the first fluctuation analysis of optical trap based bead-motor assays (Svoboda et al. in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91(25):11782, 1994), loses its original purpose of estimating the number of rate-determining steps in the chemical cycle when backward steps and wasted hydrolyses are present. As a simple application of our formulation, we extend the randomness parameter’s scope by showing how it can be used to infer the presence of wasted hydrolyses and backward steps with certainty. A more powerful fluctuation analysis using higher cumulant rate measurements is proposed: the method allows one to estimates the number of intermediate reactions, the average chemical rate, and the probability of stepping backward or forward. The stability of the method in the presence of measurement errors is demonstrated numerically to encourage its use in experiments.",Arjun Krishnan1 nAff2 & Bogdan I.

0,On the Link Between Small Ball Probabilities and the Quantization Problem for Gaussian Measures on Banach Spaces,"Let μ be a centered Gaussian measure on a separable Banach space E and N a positive integer. We study the asymptotics as N→∞ of the quantization error, i.e., the infimum over all subsets ℰ of E of cardinality N of the average distance w.r.t. μ to the closest point in the set ℰ. We compare the quantization error with the average distance which is obtained when the set ℰ is chosen by taking N i.i.d. copies of random elements with law μ. Our approach is based on the study of the asymptotics of the measure of a small ball around 0. Under slight conditions on the regular variation of the small ball function, we get upper and lower bounds of the deterministic and random quantization error and are able to show that both are of the same order. Our conditions are typically satisfied in case the Banach space is infinite dimensional.","S. Dereich, F. Fehringer, A. Matoussi & …M.

0,Circulating Vaccine Derived Polio Viruses and their Impact on Global Polio Eradication,"
Poliomyelitis vaccination via live Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) suffers from the inherent problem of reversion: the vaccine may, upon replication in the human gut, mutate back to virulence and transmissibility resulting in circulating vaccine derived polio viruses (cVDPVs). We formulate a general mathematical model to assess the impact of cVDPVs on prospects for polio eradication. We find that for OPV coverage levels below a certain threshold, cVDPVs have a small impact in comparison to the expected endemic level of the disease in the absence of reversion. Above this threshold, the model predicts a small but significant endemic level of the disease, even where standard models predict eradication. In light of this, we consider and analyze three alternative eradication strategies involving a transition from continuous OPV vaccination to either continuous Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV), pulsed OPV vaccination, or a one-time IPV pulse vaccination. Stochastic modeling shows continuous IPV vaccination is effective at achieving eradication for moderate coverage levels, while pulsed OPV is effective if higher coverage levels are maintained. The one-time pulse IPV method may also be a viable strategy, especially in terms of the number of vaccinations required and time to eradication, provided that a sufficiently large pulse is practically feasible. More investigation is needed regarding the frequency of revertant virus infection resulting directly from vaccination, the ability of IPV to induce gut immunity, and the potential role of spatial transmission dynamics in eradication efforts.

0,Effect of Neuromodulation of Short-term Plasticity on Information Processing in Hippocampal Interneuron Synapses,"Neurons in a micro-circuit connected by chemical synapses can have their connectivity affected by the prior activity of the cells. The number of synapses available for releasing neurotransmitter can be decreased by repetitive activation through depletion of readily releasable neurotransmitter (NT), or increased through facilitation, where the probability of release of NT is increased by prior activation. These competing effects can create a complicated and subtle range of time-dependent connectivity. Here we investigate the probabilistic properties of facilitation and depression (FD) for a presynaptic neuron that is receiving a Poisson spike train of input. We use a model of FD that is parameterized with experimental data from a hippocampal basket cell and pyramidal cell connection, for fixed frequency input spikes at frequencies in the range of theta (3–8 Hz) and gamma (20–100 Hz) oscillations. Hence our results will apply to micro-circuits in the hippocampus that are responsible for the interaction of theta and gamma rhythms associated with learning and memory. A control situation is compared with one in which a pharmaceutical neuromodulator (muscarine) is employed. We apply standard information-theoretic measures such as entropy and mutual information, and find a closed form approximate expression for the probability distribution of release probability. We also use techniques that measure the dependence of the response on the exact history of stimulation the synapse has received, which uncovers some unexpected differences between control and muscarine-added cases.","Elham Bayat Mokhtari1, J.

We consider a family of density-based confidence sets based on a general \(\phi \)-divergence measure, and formulate DCC from the perspective of robust feasibility by allowing the ambiguous distribution to run adversely within its confidence set. We derive an equivalent reformulation for DCC and show that it is equivalent to a classical chance constraint with a perturbed risk level. We also show how to evaluate the perturbed risk level by using a bisection line search algorithm for general \(\phi \)-divergence measures. In several special cases, our results can be strengthened such that we can derive closed-form expressions for the perturbed risk levels. In addition, we show that the conservatism of DCC vanishes as the size of historical data goes to infinity. Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between the conservatism of DCC and the size of historical data, which can help indicate the value of data. Finally, we conduct extensive computational experiments to test the performance of the proposed DCC model and compare various \(\phi \)-divergence measures based on a capacitated lot-sizing problem with a quality-of-service requirement.",Ruiwei Jiang1 & Yongpei Guan,Mathematical Programming,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-015-0929-7,"Stochastic programming,Chance constraints, Semi-infinite programming"

A set of experiments with twelve standard global optimization benchmarks is performed to compare evolutionary annealing with six other stochastic optimization methods.

We provide a sequence of inner approximations \({\mathbf {X}}^d_\varepsilon =\{{\mathbf {x}}\in {\mathbf {X}}:w_d({\mathbf {x}}) <\varepsilon \}\), \(d\in {\mathbb {N}}\), where \(w_d\) is a polynomial of degree d whose vector of coefficients is an optimal solution of a semidefinite program. The size of the latter increases with the degree d. We also obtain the strong and highly desirable asymptotic guarantee that \(\lambda ({\mathbf {X}}^*_\varepsilon {\setminus } {\mathbf {X}}^d_\varepsilon )\rightarrow 0\) as d increases, where \(\lambda \) is the Lebesgue measure on \({\mathbf {X}}\). Same results are also obtained for the more intricated case of distributionally robust “joint” chance-constraints. There is a price to pay for this strong asymptotic guarantee which is the scalability of such a numerical scheme, and so far this important drawback makes it limited to problems of modest dimension.

0,A Mean-Field Approximation of SIR Epidemics on an Erdös–Rényi Network Model,"The stochastic nature of epidemic dynamics on a network makes their direct study very challenging. One avenue to reduce the complexity is a mean-field approximation (or mean-field equation) of the dynamics; however, the classic mean-field equation has been shown to perform sub-optimally in many applications. Here, we adapt a recently developed mean-field equation for SIR epidemics on a network in continuous time to the discrete time case. With this new discrete mean-field approximation, this proof-of-concept study shows that, given the density of the network, there is a strong correspondence between the epidemics on an Erdös–Rényi network and a system of discrete equations. Through this connection, we developed a parameter fitting procedure that allowed us to use synthetic daily SIR data to approximate the underlying SIR epidemic parameters on the network. This procedure has improved accuracy in the estimation of the network epidemic parameters as the network density increases, and is extremely cheap computationally.

0,A discrete MMAP for analysing the behaviour of a multi-state complex dynamic system subject to multiple events,"A complex multi-state system subject to different types of failures, repairable and/or non-repairable, external shocks and preventive maintenance is modelled by considering a discrete Markovian arrival process with marked arrivals (D-MMAP). The internal performance of the system is composed of several degradation states partitioned into minor and major damage states according to the risk of failure. Random external events can produce failures throughout the system. If an external shock occurs, there may be an aggravation of the internal degradation, cumulative external damage or extreme external failure. The internal performance and the cumulative external damage are observed by random inspection. If major degradation is observed, the unit goes to the repair facility for preventive maintenance. If a repairable failure occurs then the system goes to corrective repair with different time distributions depending on the failure state. Time distributions for corrective repair and preventive maintenance depend on the failure state. Rewards and costs depending on the state at which the device failed or was inspected are introduced. The system is modelled and several measures of interest are built into transient and stationary regimes. A preventive maintenance policy is shown to determine the effectiveness of preventive maintenance and the optimum state of internal and cumulative external damage at which preventive maintenance should be taken into account. A numerical example is presented, revealing the efficacy of the model. Correlations between the numbers of different events over time and in non-overlapping intervals are calculated.

0,Maximization of AUC and Buffered AUC in binary classification,"In binary classification, performance metrics that are defined as the probability that some error exceeds a threshold are numerically difficult to optimize directly and also hide potentially important information about the magnitude of errors larger than the threshold. Defining similar metrics, instead, using Buffered Probability of Exceedance (bPOE) generates counterpart metrics that resolve both of these issues. We apply this approach to the case of AUC, the Area Under the ROC curve, and define Buffered AUC (bAUC). We show that bAUC can provide insights into classifier performance not revealed by AUC, while being closely related as the tightest concave lower bound and representable as the area under a modified ROC curve. Additionally, while AUC is numerically difficult to optimize directly, we show that bAUC optimization often reduces to convex or linear programming. Extending these results, we show that AUC and bAUC are special cases of Generalized bAUC and that popular Support Vector Machine (SVM) formulations for approximately maximizing AUC are equivalent to direct maximization of Generalized bAUC. We also prove bAUC generalization bounds for these SVM’s. As a central component to these results, we provide an important, novel formula for calculating bPOE, the inverse of Conditional Value-at-Risk. Using this formula, we show that particular bPOE minimization problems reduce to convex and linear programming.",Matthew Norton1 & Stan Uryasev,Mathematical Programming,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-018-1312-2,"Buffered Probability of Exceedance,Conditional-Value-at-Risk,AUC,ROC curve,Buffered AUC,Support Vector Machine,Convex programming,Classification performance metric,Generalization"

We prove that the center of the instanton, suitably normalized, converges to a Brownian motion. Moreover, given any two initial data, each one close to an instanton, we construct a coupling of the corresponding processes so that in the limit ε→0+ the time of success of the coupling (suitably normalized) converges in law to the first encounter of two Brownian paths starting from the centers of the instantons that approximate the initial data.","S.

0,Fubini Type Products for Densities and Liftings,"
In our former paper (Fund. Math. 166, 281–303, 2000) we discussed densities and liftings in the product of two probability spaces with good section properties analogous to that for measures and measurable sets in the Fubini Theorem. In the present paper we investigate the following more delicate problem: Let (Ω,Σ,μ) and (Θ,T,ν) be two probability spaces endowed with densities υ and τ, respectively. Can we define a density on the product space by means of a Fubini type formula 
\((\upsilon\odot\tau)(E)=\{(\omega,\theta):\omega\in\upsilon(\{\bar {\omega}:\theta\in\tau(E_{\bar{\omega}}\})\}\)
, for E measurable in the product, and the same for liftings instead of densities? We single out classes of marginal densities υ and τ which admit a positive solution in case of densities, where we have sometimes to replace the Fubini type product by its upper hull, which we call box product. For liftings the answer is in general negative, but our analysis of the above problem leads to a new method, which allows us to find a positive solution. In this way we solved one of the main problems of Musiał, Strauss and Macheras (Fund. Math. 166, 281–303, 2000).

0,Scenario reduction for stochastic programs with Conditional Value-at-Risk,"In this paper we discuss scenario reduction methods for risk-averse stochastic optimization problems. Scenario reduction techniques have received some attention in the literature and are used by practitioners, as such methods allow for an approximation of the random variables in the problem with a moderate number of scenarios, which in turn make the optimization problem easier to solve. The majority of works for scenario reduction are designed for classical risk-neutral stochastic optimization problems; however, it is intuitive that in the risk-averse case one is more concerned with scenarios that correspond to high cost. By building upon the notion of effective scenarios recently introduced in the literature, we formalize that intuitive idea and propose a scenario reduction technique for stochastic optimization problems where the objective function is a Conditional Value-at-Risk. Numerical results presented with problems from the literature illustrate the performance of the method and indicate the cases where we expect it to perform well.","Sebastián Arpón1, Tito Homem-de-Mello

0,A Combinatorial Analysis of Interacting Diffusions,"We attempt to unify the analysis of several families of naturally occurring multidimensional stochastic processes by studying the underlying combinatorics involved. At equilibrium, the behavior of these processes is determined by the properties of a randomly chosen point of a corresponding polyhedron. How such a randomly chosen point behaves is a difficult question which is intertwined with the geometry and the symmetry of the polyhedron. The simplest of all cases is the simplex where a complete probabilistic study is known. A possible general strategy is through triangulation of the polyhedron where we decompose it as a union of simplices with non-intersecting interiors. In particular we study the case when the polyhedron is a simplicial polytope, since they correspond to the natural examples of stochastic processes. This is the case when the polytope is invariant under a Coxeter group action, which leads to a simple and explicit description of the equilibrium behavior of the stochastic processes in terms of independent and identically distributed Exponential random variables. Another class of examples is furnished by processes indexed by weighted graphs, all of which generate simplicial polytopes with n! faces. We show that the proportion of volume contained in each component simplex corresponds to a probability distribution on the group of permutations, some of which have surprising connections with the classical urn models.",Sourav Chatterjee1 & Soumik Pal,Journal of Theoretical Probability,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10959-009-0269-8,"Interacting diffusions,Coxeter groups,Atlas model,Rank-based interactions"

This is achieved by a fully encapsulated operator, called Registrar, which is effortlessly placed between the GA and the objective function. The Registrar does not approximate the objective function. Instead, it replaces the chromosomes requested by the GA with similar ones taken from the registry, bypassing the function evaluation. Unlike other methods that use external memory to increase genetic diversity, our simple implementation encourages revisits in order to avoid evaluations in an aggressive manner. Significant increase in performance is observed which is present even at the early stages of evolution, in accordance with the Birthday Problem of probability theory.

0,"Structural, continuity, and asymptotic properties of a branching particle system","We delineate a connection between the stochastic evolution of the cluster structure of a specific branching–diffusing particle system and a certain previously unknown structure-invariance property of a related class of distributions. Thus, we demonstrate that a Pólya–Aeppli sum of i.i.d.r.v.’s with a common zero-modified geometric distribution also follows a Pólya–Aeppli law. The consideration of these classes is motivated by and applied to studying subtle properties of this branching–diffusing particle system, which belongs to the domain of attraction of a continuous Dawson–Watanabe superprocess. We illustrate this structure-invariance property by considering the Athreya–Ney-type representation of the cluster structure of our particle system. Also, we apply this representation to prove the continuity in mean square of a related real-valued stochastic process. In contrast to other works in this field, we impose the condition that the initial random number of particles follows a Pólya–Aeppli law – a condition that is consistent with stochastic models that emerge in such varied fields as population genetics, ecology, insurance risk, and bacteriophage growth. Our results extend some recent work of Vinogradov. Specifically, we resolve the issue of noninvariance of the initial field and manage to avoid related anomalies that arose in earlier studies. Also, we demonstrate that under natural additional assumptions, our particle system must have evolved from a scaled Poisson field starting at a specified time. In some sense, this result provides a partial justification for assuming that the system had originated at a certain time in the past from a Poisson field of particles. We demonstrate that the corresponding high-density limit of our branching–diffusing particle system inherits an analogous backward-evolution property. Several of our results illustrate a general convergence theorem of Jørgensen et al. to members of the power-variance family of distributions. Finally, combining a Poisson mixture representation for the branching particle system considered with certain sharp analytical methods gives us an explicit representation for the leading error term of the high-density approximation as a linear combination of related Bessel functions. This refines a theorem of Vinogradov on the rate of convergence.",K. J. Hochberg1 & V.

0,Optimal Sampling and Christoffel Functions on General Domains,"We consider the problem of reconstructing an unknown function \(u\in L^2(D,\mu )\) from its evaluations at given sampling points \(x^1,\dots ,x^m\in D\), where \(D\subset {\mathbb {R}}^d\) is a general domain and \(\mu \) a probability measure. The approximation is picked from a linear space \(V_n\) of interest where \(n=\dim (V_n)\). Recent results (Cohen and Migliorati in SMAI J Comput Math 3:181–203, 2017, Doostan and Hampton in Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 290:73–97, 2015, Jakeman et al. in Math Comput 86:1913–1947, 2017) have revealed that certain weighted least-squares methods achieve near best (or instance optimal) approximation with a sampling budget m that is proportional to n, up to a logarithmic factor \(\ln (2n/\varepsilon )\), where \(\varepsilon >0\) is a probability of failure. The sampling points should be picked at random according to a well-chosen probability measure \(\sigma \) whose density is given by the inverse Christoffel function that depends both on \(V_n\) and \(\mu \). While this approach is greatly facilitated when D and \(\mu \) have tensor product structure, it becomes problematic for domains D with arbitrary geometry since the optimal measure depends on an orthonormal basis of \(V_n\) in \(L^2(D,\mu )\) which is not explicitly given, even for simple polynomial spaces. Therefore, sampling according to this measure is not practically feasible. One computational solution recently proposed in Adcock and Huybrechs (Approximating smooth, multivariate functions on irregular domains, forum of mathematics, sigma, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2020) relies on using the restrictions of an orthonormal basis of \(V_n\) defined on a simpler bounding domain and sampling according to the original probability measure \(\mu \), in turn giving up on the optimal sampling budget \(m\sim n\). In this paper, we discuss practical sampling strategies, which amounts to using a perturbed measure \(\widetilde{\sigma }\) that can be computed in an offline stage, not involving the measurement of u, as recently proposed in Adcock and Cardenas (SIAM J Math Data Sci 2:607–630, 2020) and Migliorati (IMA J Numer Anal, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1093/imanum/draa023). We show that near best approximation is attained by the resulting weighted least-squares method at near-optimal sampling budget and we discuss multilevel approaches that preserve optimality of the cumulated sampling budget when the spaces \(V_n\) are iteratively enriched. These strategies rely on the knowledge of a-priori upper bounds B(n) on the inverse Christoffel function for the space \(V_n\) and the domain D. We establish bounds of the form \(\mathcal O(n^r)\) for spaces \(V_n\) of multivariate algebraic polynomials of given total degree, and for general domains D. The exact growth rate r depends on the regularity of the domain, in particular \(r=2\) for domains with Lipschitz boundaries and \(r=\frac{d+1}{d}\) for smooth domains.",Matthieu Dolbeault1 & Albert Cohen,Constructive Approximation,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00365-021-09558-x,"Least-squares approximation,Optimal recovery,Random sampling,Christoffel functions,Multivariate polynomials"

In particular, it is concerned with the presumption that the analogy holds in terms of interpreting a special spherical limiting distribution, the hyperspherical Brownian distribution, as the distribution of the resultant rotation composed by a sequence of successive random rotations under similarly mild assumptions as applied in the central limit theorem for Euclidean space. This interpretation has been stressed at several instances to indicate the superiority of the spherical Brownian distribution for applications in texture component fit methods. Here it is shown, however, that this presumption is false.

This is achieved by introducing nonanticipativity constraints for the first stage decision variables, rearranging the minimax problem through Lagrange decomposition and applying the well-known primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method to the new minimax problem. The algorithmic framework does not depend on specific structure of the ambiguity set. To extend the algorithm to the case that the underlying random variables are continuously distributed, we propose a discretization scheme and quantify the error arising from the discretization in terms of the optimal value and the optimal solutions when the ambiguity set is constructed through generalized prior moment conditions, the Kantorovich ball and \(\phi\)-divergence centred at an empirical probability distribution.

A random sample \(\mathbb {X}_n = \{X_1,\ldots ,X_n\}\subset \mathbb {R}^D\) composed of points close to a d-dimensional submanifold M, with or without outliers drawn in the ambient space, is observed. Based on the tangential Delaunay complex (Discrete Comput Geom 51(1):221–267 2014), we construct an estimator \(\widehat{M}\) that is ambient isotopic and Hausdorff-close to M with high probability. The estimator \(\widehat{M}\) is built from existing algorithms. In a model with additive noise of small amplitude, we show that this estimator is asymptotically minimax optimal for the Hausdorff distance over a class of submanifolds satisfying a reach constraint. Therefore, even with no a priori information on the tangent spaces of M, our estimator based on Tangential Delaunay Complexes is optimal. This shows that the optimal rate of convergence can be achieved through existing algorithms. A similar result is also derived in a model with outliers. A geometric interpolation result is derived, showing that the Tangential Delaunay Complex is stable with respect to noise and perturbations of the tangent spaces. In the process, a decluttering procedure and a tangent space estimator both based on local principal component analysis (PCA) are studied.","Eddie Aamari

0,Stochastic PDEs and Lack of Regularity,"We review results on the existence and uniqueness for a surface growth model with or without space–time white noise. If the surface is a graph, then this model has striking similarities to the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in terms of energy estimates and scaling properties, and in both models the question of uniqueness of global weak solutions remains open.In the physically relevant dimension \(d=2\) and with the physically relevant space–time white noise driving the equation, the direct fixed-point argument for mild solutions fails, as there is not sufficient regularity for the stochastic forcing. The situation is the simplest case where the method of regularity structures introduced by Martin Hairer can be applied, although we follow here a significantly simpler approach to highlight the key problems. Using spectral Galerkin method or any other type of regularization of the noise, one can give a rigorous meaning to the stochastic PDE and show existence and uniqueness of local solutions in that setting. Moreover, several types of regularization seem to yield all the same solution.We finally comment briefly on possible blow up phenomena and show with a simple argument that many complex-valued solutions actually do blow up in finite time. This shows that energy estimates alone are not enough to verify global uniqueness of solutions.

The scaling approach and the diffusion approximation techniques which are widely used in mathematical population genetics provide modeling tools and conceptual background to assist in the study of species dynamics, and help exploring the analogy between trait-dependent species diversification and the evolution of allele frequencies in the population genetics setting. The analytical framework specified is then applied to models incorporating diversity-dependence, in order to infer effective results from processes in which the net diversification of species depends on the total number of species. In particular, the long term fate of a rare trait may be analyzed under a partly symmetric scenario, using a time-change transform technique.","Ingemar Kaj

0,Measuring Edge Importance: A Quantitative Analysis of the Stochastic Shielding Approximation for Random Processes on Graphs,"Mathematical models of cellular physiological mechanisms often involve random walks on graphs representing transitions within networks of functional states. Schmandt and Galán recently introduced a novel stochastic shielding approximation as a fast, accurate method for generating approximate sample paths from a finite state Markov process in which only a subset of states are observable. For example, in ion-channel models, such as the Hodgkin–Huxley or other conductance-based neural models, a nerve cell has a population of ion channels whose states comprise the nodes of a graph, only some of which allow a transmembrane current to pass. The stochastic shielding approximation consists of neglecting fluctuations in the dynamics associated with edges in the graph not directly affecting the observable states. We consider the problem of finding the optimal complexity reducing mapping from a stochastic process on a graph to an approximate process on a smaller sample space, as determined by the choice of a particular linear measurement functional on the graph. The partitioning of ion-channel states into conducting versus nonconducting states provides a case in point. In addition to establishing that Schmandt and Galán’s approximation is in fact optimal in a specific sense, we use recent results from random matrix theory to provide heuristic error estimates for the accuracy of the stochastic shielding approximation for an ensemble of random graphs. Moreover, we provide a novel quantitative measure of the contribution of individual transitions within the reaction graph to the accuracy of the approximate process.","Deena R Schmidt1,2 & Peter J Thomas1,2,",The Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2190-8567-4-6,"Markov process,Complexity reduction,Ion channel,Hodgkin–Huxley model,Networks,Random graphs"

0,"Modelling persistence diagrams with planar point processes, and revealing topology with bagplots","We introduce a new model for planar point processes, with the aim of capturing the structure of point interaction and spread in persistence diagrams. Persistence diagrams themselves are a key tool of topological data analysis (TDA), crucial for the delineation and estimation of global topological structure in large data sets. To a large extent, the statistical analysis of persistence diagrams has been hindered by difficulties in providing replications, a problem that was addressed in an earlier paper, which introduced a procedure called replicating statistical topology (RST). Here we significantly improve on the power of RST via the introduction of a more realistic class of models for the persistence diagrams. In addition, we introduce to TDA the idea of bagplotting, a powerful technique from non-parametric statistics well adapted for differentiating between topologically significant points, and noise, in persistence diagrams. Outside the setting of TDA, our model provides a setting for fashioning point processes, in any dimension, in which both local interactions between the points, along with global restraints on the overall, global, shape of the point cloud, are important and perhaps competing.

0,"Random variables, monotone relations, and convex analysis","Random variables can be described by their cumulative distribution functions, a class of nondecreasing functions on the real line. Those functions can in turn be identified, after the possible vertical gaps in their graphs are filled in, with maximal monotone relations. Such relations are known to be the subdifferentials of convex functions. Analysis of these connections yields new insights. The generalized inversion operation between distribution functions and quantile functions corresponds to graphical inversion of monotone relations. In subdifferential terms, it corresponds to passing to conjugate convex functions under the Legendre–Fenchel transform. Among other things, this shows that convergence in distribution for sequences of random variables is equivalent to graphical convergence of the monotone relations and epigraphical convergence of the associated convex functions. Measures of risk that employ quantiles (VaR) and superquantiles (CVaR), either individually or in mixtures, are illuminated in this way. Formulas for their calculation are seen from a perspective that reveals how they were discovered. The approach leads further to developments in which the superquantiles for a given distribution are interpreted as the quantiles for an overlying “superdistribution.” In this way a generalization of Koenker–Basset error is derived which lays a foundation for superquantile regression as a higher-order extension of quantile regression.",R.

Our argument uses the method of characteristics along with a careful estimate involving an equation of the edge. With the rigidity estimates as an input, we prove a central limit theorem for mesoscopic statistics near the edge, which, as far as we know, has been done for the first time in this paper. Additionally, combining our results with Landon and Yau (Edge statistics of Dyson Brownian motion. arXiv:1712.03881, 2017), we give a proof of the local ergodicity of the Dyson Brownian motion for general \(\beta \) and potential at the edge, i.e., we show the distribution of extreme particles converges to the Tracy–Widom \(\beta \) distribution in a short time.

0,"Properties of isoperimetric, functional and Transport-Entropy inequalities via concentration","Various properties of isoperimetric, functional, Transport-Entropy and concentration inequalities are studied on a Riemannian manifold equipped with a measure, whose generalized Ricci curvature is bounded from below. First, stability of these inequalities with respect to perturbation of the measure is obtained. The extent of the perturbation is measured using several different distances between perturbed and original measure, such as a one-sided L
∞ bound on the ratio between their densities, Wasserstein distances, and Kullback–Leibler divergence. In particular, an extension of the Holley–Stroock perturbation lemma for the log-Sobolev inequality is obtained, and the dependence on the perturbation parameter is improved from linear to logarithmic. Second, the equivalence of Transport-Entropy inequalities with different cost-functions is verified, by obtaining a reverse Jensen type inequality. The main tool used is a previous precise result on the equivalence between concentration and isoperimetric inequalities in the described setting. Of independent interest is a new dimension independent characterization of Transport-Entropy inequalities with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance, which does not assume any curvature lower bound.",Emanuel Milman,Probability Theory and Related Fields,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-010-0328-1,"Isoperimetric inequality,Log-Sobolev inequality,Transport-Entropy inequality,Concentration inequality,Stability under perturbation,Wasserstein distance"

0,"Multi-point Gaussian States, Quadratic–Exponential Cost Functionals, and Large Deviations Estimates for Linear Quantum Stochastic Systems","This paper is concerned with risk-sensitive performance analysis for linear quantum stochastic systems interacting with external bosonic fields. We consider a cost functional in the form of the exponential moment of the integral of a quadratic polynomial of the system variables over a bounded time interval. Such functionals are related to more conservative behaviour and robustness of systems with respect to statistical uncertainty, which makes the challenging problems of their computation and minimization practically important. To this end, we obtain an integro-differential equation for the time evolution of the quadratic–exponential functional, which is different from the original quantum risk-sensitive performance criterion employed previously for measurement-based quantum control and filtering problems. Using multi-point Gaussian quantum states for the past history of the system variables and their first four moments, we discuss a quartic approximation of the cost functional and its infinite-horizon asymptotic behaviour. The computation of the asymptotic growth rate of this approximation is reduced to solving two algebraic Lyapunov equations. Further approximations of the cost functional, based on higher-order cumulants and their growth rates, are applied to large deviations estimates in the form of upper bounds for tail distributions. We discuss an auxiliary classical Gaussian–Markov diffusion process in a complex Euclidean space which reproduces the quantum system variables at the level of covariances but has different fourth-order cumulants, thus showing that the risk-sensitive criteria are not reducible to quadratic–exponential moments of classical Gaussian processes. The results of the paper are illustrated by a numerical example and may find applications to coherent quantum risk-sensitive control problems, where the plant and controller form a fully quantum closed-loop system, and other settings with nonquadratic cost functionals.","Igor G.

A special case is the Gaussian setting, i.e. when the underlying process is fractional Brownian motion, in which our result settles a conjecture by Molchan [Commun. Math.

0,Developing a statistically powerful measure for quartet tree inference using phylogenetic identities and Markov invariants,"Recently there has been renewed interest in phylogenetic inference methods based on phylogenetic invariants, alongside the related Markov invariants. Broadly speaking, both these approaches give rise to polynomial functions of sequence site patterns that, in expectation value, either vanish for particular evolutionary trees (in the case of phylogenetic invariants) or have well understood transformation properties (in the case of Markov invariants). While both approaches have been valued for their intrinsic mathematical interest, it is not clear how they relate to each other, and to what extent they can be used as practical tools for inference of phylogenetic trees. In this paper, by focusing on the special case of binary sequence data and quartets of taxa, we are able to view these two different polynomial-based approaches within a common framework. To motivate the discussion, we present three desirable statistical properties that we argue any invariant-based phylogenetic method should satisfy: (1) sensible behaviour under reordering of input sequences; (2) stability as the taxa evolve independently according to a Markov process; and (3) explicit dependence on the assumption of a continuous-time process. Motivated by these statistical properties, we develop and explore several new phylogenetic inference methods. In particular, we develop a statistically bias-corrected version of the Markov invariants approach which satisfies all three properties. We also extend previous work by showing that the phylogenetic invariants can be implemented in such a way as to satisfy property (3). A simulation study shows that, in comparison to other methods, our new proposed approach based on bias-corrected Markov invariants is extremely powerful for phylogenetic inference. The binary case is of particular theoretical interest as—in this case only—the Markov invariants can be expressed as linear combinations of the phylogenetic invariants. A wider implication of this is that, for models with more than two states—for example DNA sequence alignments with four-state models—we find that methods which rely on phylogenetic invariants are incapable of satisfying all three of the stated statistical properties. This is because in these cases the relevant Markov invariants belong to a class of polynomials independent from the phylogenetic invariants.","Jeremy G. Sumner

0,Recurrence of inhomogeneous random walks,"
Inhomogeneous random walk means to study the time evolution of a sum of independent vector valued random variables (called “steps”), where we go beyond the traditional framework of Random Walks by dropping the usual condition of “identically distributed steps”. Our results show that genuinely 2-dimensional steps suffice—we do not need identically distributed steps to prove 2-dimensional Pólya type theorems. It turns out that we do not even need a whole 2-dimensional random walk: we can guarantee recurrence in a given sparse subsequence of the steps. An interesting example is the two-dimensional simple symmetric random walk on the lattice \(\mathbb {Z}^2\), where we can prove recurrence for the sequence of primes; more precisely, for the sets \(\{ p+1{:}\ p\ge 3\ \mathrm{prime}\}\), or \(\{ p-1{:}\ p\ge 3\ \mathrm{prime}\}\), or \(\{ 2p{:}\ p\ge 3\ \mathrm{prime}\}\), etc. (since for return we clearly need a set of even numbers). In this direction we can prove optimal results, describing the class of sparsest subsequences still exhibiting recurrence. In fact, we can prove these best possible results for the larger class of inhomogeneous random walks. We can also prove the one-dimensional analogs, which—not surprisingly—turn out to be easier.","József Beck

The resulting algorithm is shown to both have an associated best s-term recovery guarantee in the given BOPB, and also to work well numerically for solving sparse approximation problems involving functions contained in the span of fairly general sets of as many as \(\sim 10^{230}\) orthonormal basis functions. All code is made publicly available. As part of the proof of the main recovery guarantee new variants of the well known CoSaMP algorithm are proposed which can utilize any sufficiently accurate support identification procedure satisfying a Support Identification Property (SIP) in order to obtain strong sparse approximation guarantees. These new CoSaMP variants are then proven to have both runtime and recovery error behavior which are largely determined by the associated runtime and error behavior of the chosen support identification method. The main theoretical results of the paper are then shown by developing a sublinear-time support identification algorithm for general BOPB sets which is robust to arbitrary additive errors. Using this new support identification method to create a new CoSaMP variant then results in a new robust sublinear-time compressive sensing algorithm for BOPB-compressible functions of many variables.","Bosu Choi1, Mark Iwen2,3 & Toni Volkmer",Numerische Mathematik,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-021-01200-z,"High-dimensional function approximation,Sublinear-time algorithms,Function learning,Sparse approximation,Compressive Sensing,Sparse Fourier transforms (SFT)"

ACM-SIAM Sympos. Discrete Algo., pp. 484–493, 2006), which is based, as is the present paper, on Cohen’s technique for approximate range counting (Cohen in J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 55:441–453, 1997). In this approach, one chooses a small number of random permutations of P, and then constructs, for each permutation π, a data structure that answers efficiently minimum range queries: Given a query halfspace h, find the minimum-rank element (according to π) in P∩h. By repeating this process for all chosen permutations, the approximate count can be obtained, with high probability, using a certain averaging process over the minimum-rank outputs.In the previous study, the authors have constructed such a data structure in ℝ3, using a combinatorial result about the overlay of minimization diagrams in a randomized incremental construction of lower envelopes.In the present work, we propose an alternative approach to the range-minimum problem, based on cuttings, which achieves better performance. Specifically, it uses, for each permutation, O(n

0,Anisotropic local laws for random matrices,"We develop a new method for deriving local laws for a large class of random matrices. It is applicable to many matrix models built from sums and products of deterministic or independent random matrices. In particular, it may be used to obtain local laws for matrix ensembles that are anisotropic in the sense that their resolvents are well approximated by deterministic matrices that are not multiples of the identity. For definiteness, we present the method for sample covariance matrices of the form , where T is deterministic and X is random with independent entries. We prove that with high probability the resolvent of Q is close to a deterministic matrix, with an optimal error bound and down to optimal spectral scales. As an application, we prove the edge universality of Q by establishing the Tracy–Widom–Airy statistics of the eigenvalues of Q near the soft edges. This result applies in the single-cut and multi-cut cases.

0,Stochastic Pareto local search: Pareto neighbourhood exploration and perturbation strategies,"Pareto local search (PLS) methods are local search algorithms for multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems based on the Pareto dominance criterion. PLS explores the Pareto neighbourhood of a set of non-dominated solutions until it reaches a local optimal Pareto front. In this paper, we discuss and analyse three different Pareto neighbourhood exploration strategies: best, first, and neutral improvement. Furthermore, we introduce a deactivation mechanism that restarts PLS from an archive of solutions rather than from a single solution in order to avoid the exploration of already explored regions. To escape from a local optimal solution set we apply stochastic perturbation strategies, leading to stochastic Pareto local search algorithms (SPLS). We consider two perturbation strategies: mutation and path-guided mutation. While the former is unbiased, the latter is biased towards preserving common substructures between 2 solutions. We apply SPLS on a set of large, correlated bi-objective quadratic assignment problems (bQAPs) and observe that SPLS significantly outperforms multi-start PLS. We investigate the reason of this performance gain by studying the fitness landscape structure of the bQAPs using random walks. The best performing method uses the stochastic perturbation algorithms, the first improvement Pareto neigborhood exploration and the deactivation technique.","Mădălina M.

0,Number of 1-Factorizations of Regular High-Degree Graphs,"A 1-factor in an n-vertex graph G is a collection of \(\frac{n}{2}\) vertex-disjoint edges and a 1-factorization of G is a partition of its edges into edge-disjoint 1-factors. Clearly, a 1-factorization of G cannot exist unless n is even and G is regular (that is, all vertices are of the same degree). The problem of finding 1-factorizations in graphs goes back to a paper of Kirkman in 1847 and has been extensively studied since then. Deciding whether a graph has a 1-factorization is usually a very difficult question. For example, it took more than 60 years and an impressive tour de force of Csaba, Kühn, Lo, Osthus and Treglown to prove an old conjecture of Dirac from the 1950s, which says that every d-regular graph on n vertices contains a 1-factorization, provided that n is even and \(d \geqslant 2\left[ {\frac{n}{4}} \right] - 1\). In this paper we address the natural question of estimating F(n, d), the number of 1-factorizations in d-regular graphs on an even number of vertices, provided that \(d \geqslant \left[ {\frac{n}{2}} \right] + \varepsilon n\). Improving upon a recent result of Ferber and Jain, which itself improved upon a result of Cameron from the 1970s, we show that \(F\left( {n,\,d} \right) \geqslant {\left( {\left( {1 + o\left( 1 \right)} \right)\frac{d}{{{e^2}}}} \right)^{nd/2}}\), which is asymptotically best possible.","Asaf Ferber1, Vishesh Jain2 & Benny Sudakov",Combinatorica,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00493-019-3970-y,"05C70,05D40"

The new pricing operator guarantees put-call parity to hold for model prices and the value of a forward contract to match the buy-and-hold strategy, even if the underlying follows strict local martingale dynamics. More precisely, we discuss a change of numéraire (change of currency) technique when the underlying is only a local martingale, modelling for example an exchange rate. The new pricing operator assigns prices to contingent claims according to the minimal cost for superreplication strategies that succeed with probability one for both currencies as numéraire. Within this context, we interpret the lack of the martingale property of an exchange rate as a reflection of the possibility that the numéraire currency may devalue completely against the asset currency (hyperinflation).","Peter Carr1, Travis Fisher & Johannes Ruf",Finance and Stochastics,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-013-0218-3,"Foreign exchange,Pricing operator,Put-call parity,Strict local martingales,Föllmer measure,Change of numéraire,Hyperinflation"

The proposed numerical scheme can be applied to different multivariate Lévy constructions such as subordination and linear combination provided that the joint characteristic function is available. The proposed FFT-network can be thought of as a lattice approach implemented through the characteristic function. With the prevalent implementation of FFT, the network approach results in significant computational time reduction while maintaining satisfactory accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate option pricing on a single asset where the asset return and its volatility are driven by a pair of dependent Lévy processes. Such a model is also called the random time-changed Lévy process.

We provide the theoretical analysis as well as the detailed runtime comparison of these algorithms on concrete biological models.

However, it is based on an antipodal way of thinking to the thinking that leads constrained minimization methods. Instead of adapting unconstrained minimization algorithms to handling constraints, it adapts feasibility-seeking algorithms to reduce (not necessarily minimize) target function values. This is done while retaining the feasibility-seeking nature of the algorithm and without paying a high computational price. A guarantee that the local target function reduction steps properly accumulate to a global target function value reduction is still missing in spite of an ever-growing body of publications that supply evidence of the success of the superiorization method in various problems.

0,Overcoming the Curse of Dimensionality in the Numerical Approximation of Parabolic Partial Differential Equations with Gradient-Dependent Nonlinearities ,"Partial differential equations (PDEs) are a fundamental tool in the modeling of many real-world phenomena. In a number of such real-world phenomena the PDEs under consideration contain gradient-dependent nonlinearities and are high-dimensional. Such high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs can in nearly all cases not be solved explicitly, and it is one of the most challenging tasks in applied mathematics to solve high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs approximately. It is especially very challenging to design approximation algorithms for nonlinear PDEs for which one can rigorously prove that they do overcome the so-called curse of dimensionality in the sense that the number of computational operations of the approximation algorithm needed to achieve an approximation precision of size \({\varepsilon }> 0\) grows at most polynomially in both the PDE dimension \(d \in \mathbb {N}\) and the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy \({\varepsilon }\). In particular, to the best of our knowledge there exists no approximation algorithm in the scientific literature which has been proven to overcome the curse of dimensionality in the case of a class of nonlinear PDEs with general time horizons and gradient-dependent nonlinearities. It is the key contribution of this article to overcome this difficulty. More specifically, it is the key contribution of this article (i) to propose a new full-history recursive multilevel Picard approximation algorithm for high-dimensional nonlinear heat equations with general time horizons and gradient-dependent nonlinearities and (ii) to rigorously prove that this full-history recursive multilevel Picard approximation algorithm does indeed overcome the curse of dimensionality in the case of such nonlinear heat equations with gradient-dependent nonlinearities.","Martin Hutzenthaler1, Arnulf Jentzen2,3 & Thomas Kruse",Foundations of Computational Mathematics,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-021-09514-y,"Curse of dimensionality,Partial differential equation,PDE,Backward stochastic differential equation,BSDE,Multilevel Picard,Multilevel Monte Carlo,Gradient-dependent nonlinearity"

0,Distributed Dynamic Reinforcement of Efficient Outcomes in Multiagent Coordination and Network Formation,"We analyze reinforcement learning under so-called “dynamic reinforcement.” In reinforcement learning, each agent repeatedly interacts with an unknown environment (i.e., other agents), receives a reward, and updates the probabilities of its next action based on its own previous actions and received rewards. Unlike standard reinforcement learning, dynamic reinforcement uses a combination of long-term rewards and recent rewards to construct myopically forward looking action selection probabilities. We analyze the long-term stability of the learning dynamics for general games with pure strategy Nash equilibria and specialize the results for coordination games and distributed network formation. In this class of problems, more than one stable equilibrium (i.e., coordination configuration) may exist. We demonstrate equilibrium selection under dynamic reinforcement. In particular, we show how a single agent is able to destabilize an equilibrium in favor of another by appropriately adjusting its dynamic reinforcement parameters. We contrast the conclusions with prior game theoretic results according to which the risk-dominant equilibrium is the only robust equilibrium when agents’ decisions are subject to small randomized perturbations.

0,Invariant Rigid Geometric Structures and Smooth Projective Factors,"We consider actions of non-compact simple Lie groups preserving an analytic rigid geometric structure of algebraic type on a compact manifold. The structure is not assumed to be unimodular, so an invariant measure may not exist. Ergodic stationary measures always exist, and when such a measure has full support, we show the following:


1.
Either the manifold admits a smooth equivariant map onto a homogeneous projective variety, defined on an open dense conull invariant set, or the Lie algebra of the Zariski closure of the Gromov representation of the fundamental group contains a Lie subalgebra isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the acting group. As a corollary, a smooth non-trivial homogeneous projective factor does exist whenever the fundamental group of M admits only virtually solvable linear representations, and thus in particular when M is simply connected, regardless of the real rank.


2.
There exist explicit examples showing that analytic rigid actions of certain simple real rank one groups may indeed fail to have a smooth projective factor.


3.
It is possible to generalize Gromov’s theorem on the algebraic hull of the representation of the fundamental group of the manifold to the case of rigid non-unimodular structures, again for actions of groups of any real rank.

0,Time-dependent propagators for stochastic models of gene expression: an analytical method,"The inherent stochasticity of gene expression in the context of regulatory networks profoundly influences the dynamics of the involved species. Mathematically speaking, the propagators which describe the evolution of such networks in time are typically defined as solutions of the corresponding chemical master equation (CME). However, it is not possible in general to obtain exact solutions to the CME in closed form, which is due largely to its high dimensionality. In the present article, we propose an analytical method for the efficient approximation of these propagators. We illustrate our method on the basis of two categories of stochastic models for gene expression that have been discussed in the literature. The requisite procedure consists of three steps: a probability-generating function is introduced which transforms the CME into (a system of) partial differential equations (PDEs); application of the method of characteristics then yields (a system of) ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which can be solved using dynamical systems techniques, giving closed-form expressions for the generating function; finally, propagator probabilities can be reconstructed numerically from these expressions via the Cauchy integral formula. The resulting ‘library’ of propagators lends itself naturally to implementation in a Bayesian parameter inference scheme, and can be generalised systematically to related categories of stochastic models beyond the ones considered here.","Frits Veerman1, Carsten Marr2 & Nikola Popović",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-017-1196-4,"Stochastic gene expression,Probability generating function,Propagator,Dynamical systems,Perturbation techniques,Asymptotic analysis"

We show that this empirical distribution converges to a limit almost surely as the number of intervals goes to infinity.

The convergence is established by showing that the size-biased empirical distribution evolves in the limit according to a certain deterministic evolution equation. Although this equation involves a non-local, non-linear operator, it can be studied thanks to a carefully chosen norm with respect to which this operator is contractive.In finite-dimensional settings, convergence results like this usually go under the name of stochastic approximation and can be approached by a general method of Kushner and Clark.

Eleven different copulas were selected to construct multivariate distribution and estimate the value-at-risk for RMB exchange rate. Empirical results show that time-invariant Student-t copula is the best model to fit the sample data. The positive upper and lower dependence indicates that CNY and CNH series tend to move in the same direction. Moreover, the dependence between the two exchange rates is asymmetric, which means that traditional models, such as Pearson’s correlation, are inappropriate to measure the correlations between these markets. The best fitted model is chosen to estimate the financial risk, which can help business practitioners and policymakers track risk evolution and make good decisions.","Jiangze Du1 & Kin Keung Lai2,",Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-017-5147-3,"Copula modeling,RMB exchange rate,RMB internationalization,value-at-risk"

The key contributions of this study include, the determination of the expected number of the leukemic stem cells, progenitor cells, mature leukemic cells, as well as total number of these cells (in terms of probabilities, and contingent on the initial cell count), expected time to reach a threshold level of total and injurious leukemic cells, as well as the critical time when the disease changes its phases, the probability of extinction of CML, and the dynamics of CML evolution consequent to primary therapy.

(J R Soc Interface 9(70):890–906, 2012). These models allow for a range of complex behaviors, and in particular allow us to explicitly incorporate duration of a contact into our mathematical models. Our focus here is to identify conditions under which simpler models may be substituted for more detailed models, and in so doing we define a hierarchy of epidemic models. In particular we provide conditions under which it is appropriate to use the standard mass action SIR model, and we show what happens when these conditions fail. Using our hierarchy, we provide a procedure leading to the choice of the appropriate model for a given population. Our result about the convergence of models to the mass action model gives clear, rigorous conditions under which the mass action model is accurate.","Joel C. Miller1,2,3 & Erik M.

In this general framework, we can reprove known results such as the average Lang–Trotter conjecture, the average Koblitz conjecture, and the vertical Sato–Tate conjecture, even for very short intervals, not accessible by previous methods. We also compute statistics for new questions, such as the problem of amicable pairs and aliquot cycles, first introduced by Silverman and Stange. Our technique is rather flexible and should be easily applicable to a wide range of similar problems. The starting point of our results is a theorem of Gekeler which gives a reinterpretation of Deuring’s theorem in terms of an Euler product involving random matrices, thus making a direct connection between the (conjectural) horizontal distributions and the vertical distributions. Our main technical result then shows that, under certain conditions, a weighted average of Euler products is asymptotic to the Euler product of the average factors.","Chantal David1, Dimitris Koukoulopoulos2 & Ethan Smith",Mathematische Annalen,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00208-016-1482-2,"11G07,11N45"

An absorption path is parametrized by the total probability of absorption in past play rather than by time, and it accommodates both discrete-time aspects and continuous-time aspects. We then define the concept of sequentially 0-perfect absorption paths, which are shown to be limits of \(\varepsilon \)-equilibrium strategy profiles as \(\varepsilon \) goes to 0. We establish that all quitting games that do not have simple equilibria (that is, an equilibrium where the game terminates in the first period or one where the game never terminates) have a sequentially 0-perfect absorption path. Finally, we prove the existence of sequentially 0-perfect absorption paths in a new class of quitting games.

0,"Heterogeneous network epidemics: real-time growth, variance and extinction of infection","Recent years have seen a large amount of interest in epidemics on networks as a way of representing the complex structure of contacts capable of spreading infections through the modern human population. The configuration model is a popular choice in theoretical studies since it combines the ability to specify the distribution of the number of contacts (degree) with analytical tractability. Here we consider the early real-time behaviour of the Markovian SIR epidemic model on a configuration model network using a multitype branching process. We find closed-form analytic expressions for the mean and variance of the number of infectious individuals as a function of time and the degree of the initially infected individual(s), and write down a system of differential equations for the probability of extinction by time t that are numerically fast compared to Monte Carlo simulation. We show that these quantities are all sensitive to the degree distribution—in particular we confirm that the mean prevalence of infection depends on the first two moments of the degree distribution and the variance in prevalence depends on the first three moments of the degree distribution. In contrast to most existing analytic approaches, the accuracy of these results does not depend on having a large number of infectious individuals, meaning that in the large population limit they would be asymptotically exact even for one initial infectious individual.","Frank Ball

We model this behavior using an integrodifference equation where the individual dispersal probability is a monotone increasing function of local density. We investigate how this dispersal probability affects the spreading speed of a single population and its ability to persist in fragmented habitats. We demonstrate that density-dependent dispersal probability can act as a mechanism for coexistence of otherwise non-coexisting competitors. We show that in time-varying habitats, an intermediate dispersal probability will evolve. Analytically, we find that the spreading speed for the integrodifference equation with density-dependent dispersal probability is not linearly determined. Furthermore, the next-generation operator is not compact and, in general, neither order-preserving nor monotonicity-preserving.

It generalizes the previous models based on the nucleotide mutation matrices 4× 4 and the trinucleotide mutation matrix 64× 64 with three and six parameters. It determines at some time t the exact occurrence probabilities of trinucleotides mutating randomly according to these nine substitution parameters. An application of this model allows an evolutionary study of the common circular code \(\mathcal{C}\) of eukaryotes and prokaryotes and its 12 coded amino acids. The main property of this code \(\mathcal{C}\) is the retrieval of the reading frames in genes, both locally, i.e. anywhere in genes and in particular without a start codon, and automatically with a window of a few nucleotides. However, since its identification in 1996, amino acid information coded by \(\mathcal{C}\) has never been studied. Very unexpectedly, this evolutionary model demonstrates that random substitutions in this code \(\mathcal{C}\) and with particular values for the nine substitutions parameters retrieve after a certain time of evolution a frequency distribution of these 12 amino acids very close to the one coded by the actual genes.",Christian J.

0,Precision and Reliability in Animal Navigation,"Uncertainty plays an important role in several navigational computations. Navigation typically depends on multiple sources of information, and different navigational systems may operate both in parallel and in combination. The optimal combination of information from different sources must take into account the uncertainty of that information. We distinguish between two types of spatial uncertainty, precision, and reliability. Precision is the inverse variance of the probability distribution that describes the information a cue contributes to an organism’s knowledge of its location. Reliability is the probability of the cue being correctly identified, or the probability of a cue being related to a target location. We argue that in most environments, precision and reliability are negatively correlated. In case of cue conflict, precision and reliability must be traded off against each other. We offer a quantitative description of optimal behaviour. Knowledge of uncertainty is also needed to optimally determine the point where a search should start when an organism has more precise spatial information in one of the spatial dimensions. We show that if there is any cost to travel, it is advantageous to head off to one side of the most likely target location and head toward the target. The magnitude of the optimal offset depends on both travel cost and search cost.","G. Pfuhl1, H. Tjelmeland2 & R.

0,RenoRmalization Group and Fractional Calculus Methods in a Complex World: A Review,"The concept of the renormalization group (RG) emerged from the renormalization of quantum field variables, which is typically used to deal with the issue of divergences to infinity in quantum field theory. Meanwhile, in the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena, it was found that the self–similarity of systems near critical points can be described using RG methods. Furthermore, since self–similarity is often a defining feature of a complex system, the RG method is also devoted to characterizing complexity. In addition, the RG approach has also proven to be a useful tool to analyze the asymptotic behavior of solutions in the singular perturbation theory.In this review paper, we discuss the origin, development, and application of the RG method in a variety of fields from the physical, social and life sciences, in singular perturbation theory, and reveal the need to connect the RG and the fractional calculus (FC). The FC is another basic mathematical approach for describing complexity. RG and FC entail a potentially new world view, which we present as a way of thinking that differs from the classical Newtonian view. In this new framework, we discuss the essential properties of complex systems from different points of view, as well as, presenting recommendations for future research based on this new way of thinking.","Lihong Guo1,2, YangQuan Chen2, Shaoyun Shi1 & …Bruce J.

Each edge is open with probability \(p\in (0,1)\), closed with probability \(1-p\) and then the process is conditioned to have a unique open connected component (bounded or unbounded). The model is defined on \({\mathbb {Z}}^d\) by passing to the limit for a sequence of finite volume models with general boundary conditions. Several questions and problems are investigated: existence, uniqueness, phase transition, DLR equations. Our main result involves the existence of a threshold \(0<p^*(d)<1\) such that any infinite volume model is necessary the vacuum state in subcritical regime (no open edges) and is non trivial in the supercritical regime (existence of a stationary unbounded connected cluster). Bounds for \(p^*(d)\) are given and show that it is drastically smaller than the standard bond percolation threshold in \({\mathbb {Z}}^d\). For instance \(0.128<p^*(2)<0.202\) (rigorous bounds) whereas the 2D bond percolation threshold is equal to 1/2.

0,"Layered Networks, Equilibrium Dynamics, and Stable Coalitions","An important aspect of network dynamics that has been missing from our understanding of network dynamics in various applied settings is the influence of strategic behavior in determining equilibrium network dynamics. Our main objective hear to say what we can regarding the emergence of stable club networks—and therefore, stable coalition structures—based on the stability properties of strategically determined equilibrium network formation dynamics. Because club networks are layered networks, our work here can be thought of as a first work on the strategic dynamics of layered networks. In addition to constructing a discounted stochastic game model (i.e., a DSG model) of club network formation, (1) we show that our DSG of network formation possesses a stationary Markov perfect equilibrium in players’ membership-action strategies; (2) we identify the assumptions on primitives which ensure that the induced equilibrium Markov process of layered club network formation satisfies the Tweedie Stability Conditions (Tweedie in Stoch Process Appl 92:345–354, 2001) and (3) we show that, as a consequence, the equilibrium Markov network formation process generates a unique decomposition of the set of state-network pairs into a transient set together with finitely many basins of attraction. Moreover, we show that if there is a basin containing a vio set (a visited infinitely often set) of club networks sufficiently close together, then the coalition structures across club networks in the vio set will be the same (i.e., closeness across networks in a vio set leads to invariance in coalition structure across networks in a vio set).","Jing Fu

0,Upper bounds on the one-arm exponent for dependent percolation models,"We prove upper bounds on the one-arm exponent \(\eta _1\) for a class of dependent percolation models which generalise Bernoulli percolation; while our main interest is level set percolation of Gaussian fields, the arguments apply to other models in the Bernoulli percolation universality class, including Poisson–Voronoi and Poisson–Boolean percolation. More precisely, in dimension \(d=2\) we prove that \(\eta _1 \le 1/3\) for continuous Gaussian fields with rapid correlation decay (e.g. the Bargmann–Fock field), and in \(d \ge 3\) we prove \(\eta _1 \le d/3\) for finite-range fields, both discrete and continuous, and \(\eta _1 \le d-2\) for fields with rapid correlation decay. Although these results are classical for Bernoulli percolation (indeed they are best-known in general), existing proofs do not extend to dependent percolation models, and we develop a new approach based on exploration and relative entropy arguments. The proof also makes use of a new Russo-type inequality for Gaussian fields, which we apply to prove the sharpness of the phase transition and the mean-field bound for finite-range fields.

0,Parallel multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for batch scheduling in heterogeneous computing and grid systems,This article presents six parallel multiobjective evolutionary algorithms applied to solve the scheduling problem in distributed heterogeneous computing and grid systems. The studied evolutionary algorithms follow an explicit multiobjective approach to tackle the simultaneous optimization of a system-related (i.e. makespan) and a user-related (i.e. flowtime) objectives. Parallel models of the proposed methods are developed in order to efficiently solve the problem. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed evolutionary algorithms are able to efficiently compute accurate results when solving standard and new large problem instances. The best of the proposed methods outperforms both deterministic scheduling heuristics and single-objective evolutionary methods previously applied to the problem.,Sergio Nesmachnow,Computational Optimization and Applications,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10589-012-9531-6,"Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms,Parallelism,Heterogeneous computing,Grid,Scheduling"
0,Trail formation based on directed pheromone deposition,"We propose an Individual-Based Model of ant-trail formation. The ants are modeled as self-propelled particles which deposit directed pheromone particles and interact with them through alignment interaction. The directed pheromone particles intend to model pieces of trails, while the alignment interaction translates the tendency for an ant to follow a trail when it meets it. Thanks to adequate quantitative descriptors of the trail patterns, the existence of a phase transition as the ant–pheromone interaction frequency is increased can be evidenced. We propose both kinetic and fluid descriptions of this model and analyze the capabilities of the fluid model to develop trail patterns. We observe that the development of patterns by fluid models require extra trail amplification mechanisms that are not needed at the Individual-Based Model level.","Emmanuel Boissard1,2, Pierre Degond1,2 & Sebastien Motsch",Journal of Mathematical Biology,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-012-0529-6,"Self-propelled particles,Pheromone deposition,Directed pheromones,Alignment interaction,Individual-Based Model,Trail detection,Pattern formation,Kinetic models,Fluid models"

0,The reconstructed tree in the lineage-based model of protracted speciation,"A popular line of research in evolutionary biology is the use of time-calibrated phylogenies for the inference of diversification processes. This requires computing the likelihood of a given ultrametric tree as the reconstructed tree produced by a given model of diversification. Etienne and Rosindell in Syst Biol 61(2):204–213, (2012) proposed a lineage-based model of diversification, called protracted speciation, where species remain incipient during a random duration before turning good species, and showed that this can explain the slowdown in lineage accumulation observed in real phylogenies. However, they were unable to provide a general likelihood formula. Here, we present a likelihood formula for protracted speciation models, where rates at which species turn good or become extinct can depend both on their age and on time. Our only restrictive assumption is that speciation rate does not depend on species status. Our likelihood formula utilizes a new technique, based on the contour of the phylogenetic tree and first developed by Lambert in Ann Probab 38(1):348–395, (2010). We consider the reconstructed trees spanned by all extant species, by all good extant species, or by all representative species, which are either good extant species or incipient species representative of some good extinct species. Specifically, we prove that each of these trees is a coalescent point process, that is, a planar, ultrametric tree where the coalescence times between two consecutive tips are independent, identically distributed random variables. We characterize the common distribution of these coalescence times in some, biologically meaningful, special cases for which the likelihood reduces to an elegant analytical formula or becomes numerically tractable.","Amaury Lambert1,2, Hélène Morlon3,4 & Rampal S.

0,Stochastic modelling of tropical cyclone tracks,"A stochastic model for the tracks of tropical cyclones that allows for the computerised generation of a large number of synthetic cyclone tracks is introduced. This will provide a larger dataset than previously available for the assessment of risks in areas affected by tropical cyclones. To improve homogeneity, the historical tracks are first split into six classes. The points of cyclone genesis are modelled as a spatial Poisson point process, the intensity of which is estimated using a generalised version of a kernel estimator. For these points, initial values of direction, translation speed, and wind speed are drawn from histograms of the historical values of these variables observed in the neighbourhood of the respective points, thereby generating a first 6-h segment of a track. The subsequent segments are then generated by drawing changes in theses variables from histograms of the historical data available near the cyclone’s current location. A termination probability for the track is determined after each segment as a function of wind speed and location. In the present paper, the model is applied to historical cyclone data from the western North Pacific, but it is general enough to be transferred to other ocean basins with only minor adjustments. A version for the North Atlantic is currently under preparation.","Jonas Rumpf1, Helga Weindl2, Peter Höppe2, Ernst Rauch2 & …Volker Schmidt",Mathematical Methods of Operations Research,2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00186-007-0168-7,"Stochastic model,Monte-Carlo simulation,Inhomogeneous Poisson point process,Generalised spatial random walk,Tropical cyclones,Risk assessment"

This work builds on previous connectivity analyses that assumed connectivity strength to be constant with respect to the stimulus. Since unmeasured neuron activity can modulate with the stimulus, the effective strength of common input connections from such hidden neurons can also modulate with the stimulus. By explicitly accounting for the resulting stimulus-dependence of effective interactions among measured neurons, we are able to remove ambiguity in the classification of causal interactions that resulted from classification errors in the previous analyses. In this way, we can more reliably distinguish causal connections among measured neurons from common input connections that arise from hidden network nodes. The approach is derived in a general mathematical framework that can be applied to other types of networks.

0,RNA folding kinetics using Monte Carlo and Gillespie algorithms,"RNA secondary structure folding kinetics is known to be important for the biological function of certain processes, such as the hok/sok system in E. coli. Although linear algebra provides an exact computational solution of secondary structure folding kinetics with respect to the Turner energy model for tiny (\(\approx \)20 nt) RNA sequences, the folding kinetics for larger sequences can only be approximated by binning structures into macrostates in a coarse-grained model, or by repeatedly simulating secondary structure folding with either the Monte Carlo algorithm or the Gillespie algorithm. Here we investigate the relation between the Monte Carlo algorithm and the Gillespie algorithm. We prove that asymptotically, the expected time for a K-step trajectory of the Monte Carlo algorithm is equal to \(\langle N \rangle \) times that of the Gillespie algorithm, where \(\langle N \rangle \) denotes the Boltzmann expected network degree. If the network is regular (i.e. every node has the same degree), then the mean first passage time (MFPT) computed by the Monte Carlo algorithm is equal to MFPT computed by the Gillespie algorithm multiplied by \(\langle N \rangle \); however, this is not true for non-regular networks. In particular, RNA secondary structure folding kinetics, as computed by the Monte Carlo algorithm, is not equal to the folding kinetics, as computed by the Gillespie algorithm, although the mean first passage times are roughly correlated. Simulation software for RNA secondary structure folding according to the Monte Carlo and Gillespie algorithms is publicly available, as is our software to compute the expected degree of the network of secondary structures of a given RNA sequence—see http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clote/RNAexpNumNbors.","Peter Clote

0,The energy transformation method for the Metropolis algorithm compared with Simulated Annealing," We present and analyze a new speed-up technique for Monte Carlo optimization: the Iterated Energy Transformation algorithm, where the Metropolis algorithm is used repeatedly with more and more favourable energy functions derived from the original one by increasing transformations. We show that this method allows a better speed-up than Simulated Annealing when convergence speed is measured by the probability of failure of the algorithm after a large number of iterations. We study also the limit of a large state space in the special case when the energy is made of a sum of independent terms. We show that the convergence time of the I.E.T. algorithm is polynomial in the size (number of coordinates) of the problem, but with a worse exponent than for Simulated Annealing. This indicates that the I.E.T. algorithm is well suited for moderate size problems but not for too large ones. The independent component case is a good model for the end of many optimization processes, when at low temperature a neighbourhood of a local minimum is explored by small and far apart modifications of the current solution. We show that in this case both global optimization methods, Simulated Annealing and the I.E.T. algorithm, are less efficient than repeated local stochastic optimizations. Using the general concept of “slow stochastic optimization algorithm”, we show that any “slow” global optimization scheme should be followed by a local one to perform the last approach to a minimum.",Olivier Catoni,Probability Theory and Related Fields,1998,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004400050145,"AMS Subject Classification(1991): 60J10,90C42"

In this paper, defence plans are constructed to guide the allocation and scheduling of different types of defence weapons against anti-ship missiles, subject to various physical and operational constraints. To reduce the frequency of replanning, decision trees are considered to explicitly account, in a probabilistic manner, for all possible outcomes of a particular action. A construction heuristic is first developed to generate an initial tree. A tabu search heuristic then improves this tree through the removal or addition of defence actions, followed by update operations aimed at maintaining the consistency. Numerical results obtained on scenarios with an increasing number of threats show that substantial improvements, in terms of survivability of the ship, can be obtained in reasonable computation times using tabu search.","Dale E.

0,The role of quantum correlations in Cop and Robber game,"We introduce and study quantized versions of Cop and Robber game. We achieve this by using graph-preserving quantum operations, which are the quantum analogues of stochastic operations preserving the graph. We provide the tight bound for the number of operations required to reach the given state. By extending them to the controlled operations, we define a quantum-controlled Cop and Robber game, which expands the classical Cop and Robber game, as well as the classically controlled quantum Cop and Robber game. In contrast to the typical scheme for introducing quantum games, we assume that both parties can utilise full information about the opponent’s strategy. We show that the utilisation of the full knowledge about the opponent’s state does not provide the advantage. Moreover, the chances of catching the Robber decrease for classical cop-win graphs. This result does not depend on the chosen model of evolution. On the other hand, the possibility to execute controlled quantum operations allows catching the Robber on almost all classical cop-win graphs. By this, we demonstrate that it is necessary to enrich the structure of correlations between the players’ systems to provide a non-trivial quantized Cop and Robber game. Thus the quantum controlled operations offer a significant advantage over the classically controlled quantum operations.","Adam Glos

We show that stochastic relations can be used to constrain priors and in some case uniquely determine them. The principle of maximum entropy turns stochastic relations into (over)determined systems of partial difference equations for the partition function. All statistical consequences of the stochastic relations are determined by the space of solutions of the system.,Per K. Jakobsen1 & V. V.

0,All adapted topologies are equal,"A number of researchers have introduced topological structures on the set of laws of stochastic processes. A unifying goal of these authors is to strengthen the usual weak topology in order to adequately capture the temporal structure of stochastic processes. Aldous defines an extended weak topology based on the weak convergence of prediction processes. In the economic literature, Hellwig introduced the information topology to study the stability of equilibrium problems. Bion–Nadal and Talay introduce a version of the Wasserstein distance between the laws of diffusion processes. Pflug and Pichler consider the nested distance (and the weak nested topology) to obtain continuity of stochastic multistage programming problems. These distances can be seen as a symmetrization of Lassalle’s causal transport problem, but there are also further natural ways to derive a topology from causal transport. Our main result is that all of these seemingly independent approaches define the same topology in finite discrete time. Moreover we show that this ‘weak adapted topology’ is characterized as the coarsest topology that guarantees continuity of optimal stopping problems for continuous bounded reward functions.

The amount of contributions paid by participants is determined by splitting it into the price of the stop-loss protection limiting the community’s total payout and an appropriate provision for the coverage of the lower layer which is mutualized inside the P2P community.

First, we present a review of some relevant recent results related to the stability criteria of similar systems. Sufficient stability conditions were obtained by Avrachenkov and Morozov (2014), which hold for a rather general retrial system. However, only in the case of Poisson input is an explicit expression provided; otherwise one has to rely on simulation. On the other hand, the stability criteria derived by Lillo (1996) can be easily computed but only hold for the case of exponential service times. We present new sufficient stability conditions, which are less tight than the ones obtained by Avrachenkov and Morozov (2010), but have an analytical expression under rather general assumptions. A key assumption is that interarrival times belongs to the class of new better than used (NBU) distributions.

0,Analysis of Individual Cell Trajectories in Lattice-Gas Cellular Automaton Models for Migrating Cell Populations,"Collective dynamics of migrating cell populations drive key processes in tissue formation and maintenance under normal and diseased conditions. Collective cell behavior at the tissue level is typically characterized by considering cell density patterns such as clusters and moving cell fronts. However, there are also important observables of collective dynamics related to individual cell behavior. In particular, individual cell trajectories are footprints of emergent behavior in populations of migrating cells. Lattice-gas cellular automata (LGCA) have proven successful to model and analyze collective behavior arising from interactions of migrating cells. There are well-established methods to analyze cell density patterns in LGCA models. Although LGCA dynamics are defined by cell-based rules, individual cells are not distinguished. Therefore, individual cell trajectories cannot be analyzed in LGCA so far. Here, we extend the classical LGCA framework to allow labeling and tracking of individual cells. We consider cell number conserving LGCA models of migrating cell populations where cell interactions are regulated by local cell density and derive stochastic differential equations approximating individual cell trajectories in LGCA. This result allows the prediction of complex individual cell trajectories emerging in LGCA models and is a basis for model–experiment comparisons at the individual cell level.","Carsten Mente1, Anja Voss-Böhme1 & Andreas Deutsch",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-015-0079-3,"Individual cell trajectories,Migrating cell populations,Lattice-gas cellular automata,Stochastic differential equations"
0,Topology Optimization of Trusses—Random Cost Method Versus Evolutionary Algorithms,"The recently proposed random cost method is applied to the topology optimization of trusses. Its performance is compared to previous genetic algorithm and evolution strategy simulations. Random cost turns out to be an optimization method with attractive features.

Furthermore it is found that in contrast to evolution strategy, the random cost strategy's ability to find optima, is independent of the initial structure.

0,The stabilizing effect of a random environment,"It is shown that the lottery competition model permits coexistence in a stochastic environment, but not in a constant environment. Conditions for coexistence and competitive exclusion are determined. Analysis of these conditions shows that the essential requirements for coexistence are overlapping generations and fluctuating birth rates which ensure that each species has periods when it is increasing. It is found that a species may persist provided only that it is favored sufficiently by the environment during favorable periods independently of the extent to which the other species is favored during its favorable periods.Coexistence is defined in terms of the stochastic boundedness criterion for species persistence. Using the lottery model as an example this criterion is justified and compared with other persistence criteria. Properties of the stationary distribution of population density are determined for an interesting limiting case of the lottery model and these are related to stochastic boundedness. An attempt is then made to relate stochastic boundedness for infinite population models to the behavior of finite population models.",Peter L.

Based on the available information, the probability density functions are attributed to every random variable to describe the dispersion of the model parameters. Numerous realizations are carried out, and the corresponding arterial pressure results are compared with the human non-invasive clinical data recorded over a mean cardiac cycle. Furthermore, the Monte Carlo simulations are performed, the convergence of the probabilistic model is proven. The different realizations are useful to define a reliable confidence region, in which the probability to have a realization is equal to 95%. It is shown through the obtained results that the error in the estimation of the arterial pressure can reach 35% when the estimation of the model parameters is subjected to an uncertainty ratio of 5%.

0,"Gibbs rapidly samples colorings of G(n, d/n)","Gibbs sampling also known as Glauber dynamics is a popular technique for sampling high dimensional distributions defined on graphs. Of special interest is the behavior of Gibbs sampling on the Erdős–Rényi random graph G(n, d/n), where each edge is chosen independently with probability d/n and d is fixed. While the average degree in G(n, d/n) is d(1−o(1)), it contains many nodes of degree of order (log n) / (log log n). The existence of nodes of almost logarithmic degrees implies that for many natural distributions defined on G(n, d/n) such as uniform coloring (with a constant number of colors) or the Ising model at any fixed inverse temperature β, the mixing time of Gibbs sampling is at least n
1+Ω(1 / log log
n) with high probability. High degree nodes pose a technical challenge in proving polynomial time mixing of the dynamics for many models including coloring. Almost all known sufficient conditions in terms of number of colors needed for rapid mixing of Gibbs samplers are stated in terms of the maximum degree of the underlying graph. In this work we consider sampling q-colorings and show that for every d < ∞ there exists q(d) < ∞ such that for all q ≥ q(d) the mixing time of the Gibbs sampling on G(n, d/n) is polynomial in n with high probability. Our results are the first polynomial time mixing results proven for the coloring model on G(n, d/n) for d > 1 where the number of colors does not depend on n. They also provide a rare example where one can prove a polynomial time mixing of Gibbs sampler in a situation where the actual mixing time is slower than npolylog(n). In previous work we have shown that similar results hold for the ferromagnetic Ising model. However, the proof for the Ising model crucially relied on monotonicity arguments and the “Weitz tree”, both of which have no counterparts in the coloring setting. Our proof presented here exploits in novel ways the local treelike structure of Erdős–Rényi random graphs, block dynamics, spatial decay properties and coupling arguments. Our results give the first polynomial-time algorithm to approximately sample colorings on G(n, d/n) with a constant number of colors. They extend to much more general families of graphs which are sparse in some average sense and to much more general interactions. In particular, they apply to any graph for which there exists an α > 0 such that every vertex v of the graph has a neighborhood N(v) of radius O(log n) in which the induced sub-graph is the union of a tree and at most O(1) edges and where each simple path Γ of length O(log n) satisfies \({\sum_{u \in \Gamma}\sum_{v \neq u}\alpha^{d(u,v)} = O({\rm log} n)}\) .

0,Polar Decomposition of Scale-Homogeneous Measures with Application to Lévy Measures of Strictly Stable Laws,"A scaling on some space is a measurable action of the group of positive real numbers. A measure on a measurable space equipped with a scaling is said to be \(\alpha \)-homogeneous for some nonzero real number \(\alpha \) if the mass of any measurable set scaled by any factor \(t > 0\) is the multiple \(t^{-\alpha }\) of the set’s original mass. It is shown rather generally that given an \(\alpha \)-homogeneous measure on a measurable space there is a measurable bijection between the space and the Cartesian product of a subset of the space and the positive real numbers (that is, a “system of polar coordinates”) such that the push-forward of the \(\alpha \)-homogeneous measure by this bijection is the product of a probability measure on the first component (that is, on the “angular” component) and an \(\alpha \)-homogeneous measure on the positive half line (that is, on the “radial” component). This result is applied to the intensity measures of Poisson processes that arise in Lévy-Khinchin-Itô-like representations of infinitely divisible random elements. It is established that if a strictly stable random element in a convex cone admits a series representation as the sum of points of a Poisson process, then it necessarily has a LePage representation as the sum of i.i.d. random elements of the cone scaled by the successive points of an independent unit-intensity Poisson process on the positive half line each raised to the power \(-\frac{1}{\alpha }\).",Steven N.

0,Phase transition in loop percolation,"We are interested in the clusters formed by a Poisson ensemble of Markovian loops on infinite graphs. This model was introduced and studied in Le Jan (C R Math Acad Sci Paris 350(13–14):643–646, 2012, Ill J Math 57(2):525–558, 2013). It is a model with long range correlations with two parameters \(\alpha \) and \(\kappa \). The non-negative parameter \(\alpha \) measures the amount of loops, and \(\kappa \) plays the role of killing on vertices penalizing (\(\kappa >0\)) or favoring (\(\kappa <0\)) appearance of large loops. It was shown in Le Jan (Ill J Math 57(2):525–558, 2013) that for any fixed \(\kappa \) and large enough \(\alpha \), there exists an infinite cluster in the loop percolation on \({\mathbb {Z}}^d\). In the present article, we show a non-trivial phase transition on the integer lattice \({\mathbb {Z}}^d\) (\(d\ge 3\)) for \(\kappa =0\). More precisely, we show that there is no loop percolation for \(\kappa =0\) and \(\alpha \) small enough. Interestingly, we observe a critical like behavior on the whole sub-critical domain of \(\alpha \), namely, for \(\kappa =0\) and any sub-critical value of \(\alpha \), the probability of one-arm event decays at most polynomially. For \(d\ge 5\), we prove that there exists a non-trivial threshold for the finiteness of the expected cluster size. For \(\alpha \) below this threshold, we calculate, up to a constant factor, the decay of the probability of one-arm event, two point function, and the tail distribution of the cluster size. These rates are comparable with the ones obtained from a single large loop and only depend on the dimension. For \(d=3\) or 4, we give better lower bounds on the decay of the probability of one-arm event, which show importance of small loops for long connections. In addition, we show that the one-arm exponent in dimension 3 depends on the intensity \(\alpha \).",Yinshan Chang1 & Artëm Sapozhnikov,Probability Theory and Related Fields,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00440-015-0624-x,"60K35,60J10"
0,A survey of unequal crossover systems and their mathematical properties,"We present a model of gene duplication by means of unequal crossover (UCO) where the probability of any given pairing between homologous sequences scales as a penalty factor p
z ≤ 1, with z the number of mismatches due to asymmetric sequence alignment. From this general representation, we derive several limiting case models of UCO, some of which have been treated elsewhere in the literature. One limiting case is random unequal crossover (RUCO), obtained by setting p = 1 (corresponding to equiprobable pairings at each site). Another limiting case scenario (the ‘Krueger-Vogel’ model) proposes an optimal ‘endpoint’ alignment which strongly penalizes both overhang and deviations from endpoint matching positions. For both of these scenarios, we make use of the symmetry properties of the transition operator (together with the more general UCO properties of copy number conservation and equal parent-offspring mean copy number) to derive the stationary distribution of gene copy number generated by UCO. For RUCO, the stationary distribution of genotypes is shown to be a negative binomial, or alternatively, a convolution of geometric distributions on ‘haplotype’ frequencies. A different type of model derived from the general representation only allows recombination without overhang (internal UCO or IntUCO). This process has the special property of converging to a single copy length or a distribution on a pair of copy lengths in the absence of any other evolutionary forces. For UCO systems in general, we also show that selection can readily act on gene copy number in all of the UCO systems we investigate due to the perfect heritability (h
2 = 1) imposed by conservation of copy number. Finally, some preliminary work is presented which suggests that the more general models based on misalignment probabilities seem to also converge to stationary distributions, which are most likely functions of parameter value p.",Max Shpak1 & Kevin Atteson1 nAff,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2002,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1006/bulm.2001.0299,"Stationary Distribution,Gene Copy Number,Global Attractor,Detailed Balance,Negative Binomial"

0,Weak Convergence of n-Particle Systems Using Bilinear Forms,The paper is concerned with the weak convergence of n-particle processes to deterministic stationary paths as \({n \rightarrow \infty}\). A Mosco type convergence of a class of bilinear forms is introduced. The Mosco type convergence of bilinear forms results in a certain convergence of the resolvents of the n-particle systems. Based on this convergence a criterion in order to verify weak convergence of invariant measures is established. Under additional conditions weak convergence of stationary n-particle processes to stationary deterministic paths is proved. The method is applied to the particle approximation of a Ginzburg-Landau type diffusion. The present paper is in close relation to the paper [9].  Different definitions of bilinear forms and versions of Mosco type convergence are introduced. Both papers demonstrate that the choice of the form and the type of convergence relates to the particular particle system.,Jörg-Uwe Löbus,Milan Journal of Mathematics,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00032-013-0200-8,"Primary 47D07,Secondary 60K35,60J35"

0,A Semigroup Approach to Harmonic Maps,"We present a semigroup approach to harmonic maps between metric spaces. Our basic assumption on the target space (N,d) is that it admits a “barycenter contraction”, i.e. a contracting map which assigns to each probability measure q on N a point b(q) in N. This includes all metric spaces with globally nonpositive curvature in the sense of Alexandrov as well as all metric spaces with globally nonpositive curvature in the sense of Busemann. It also includes all Banach spaces.The analytic input comes from the domain space (M,ρ) where we assume that we are given a Markov semigroup (pt)t>0. Typical examples come from elliptic or parabolic second-order operators on Rn, from Lévy type operators, from Laplacians on manifolds or on metric measure spaces and from convolution operators on groups. In contrast to the work of Korevaar and Schoen (1993, 1997), Jost (1994, 1997), Eells and Fuglede (2001) our semigroups are not required to be symmetric.The linear semigroup acting, e.g., on the space of bounded measurable functions u:M→R gives rise to a nonlinear semigroup (P
*t
)t acting on certain classes of measurable maps f:M → N. We will show that contraction and smoothing properties of the linear semigroup (pt)t can be extended to the nonlinear semigroup (P
*t
)t, for instance, Lp–Lq smoothing, hypercontractivity, and exponentially fast convergence to equilibrium. Among others, we state existence and uniqueness of the solution to the Dirichlet problem for harmonic maps between metric spaces. Moreover, for this solution we prove Lipschitz continuity in the interior and Hölder continuity at the boundary.Our approach also yields a new interpretation of curvature assumptions which are usually required to deduce regularity results for the harmonic map flow: lower Ricci curvature bounds on the domain space are equivalent to estimates of the L1-Wasserstein distance between the distribution of two Brownian motions in terms of the distance of their starting points; nonpositive sectional curvature on the target space is equivalent to the fact that the L1-Wasserstein distance of two distributions always dominates the distance of their barycenters.",Karl-Theodor Sturm,Potential Analysis,2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11118-004-7740-z,"harmonic map,barycenter,Markov semigroup,nonlinear Markov operator,NPC space,Hadamard space,Dirichlet problem,coupling,Wasserstein distance"

0,A certified Branch & Bound approach for reliability-based optimization problems,"Reliability-based optimization problems are optimization problems considering a constraint that measures reliability of the modelled system: the probability of a safety event with respect to controllable decision variables and uncertain random variables. Most solving approaches use approximate techniques for evaluating this reliability constraint. As a consequence, the reliability of the computed optimal decision is not guaranteed. In this paper, we investigate an interval-based Branch & Bound for solving globally reliability-based optimization problems with numerical guarantee. It combines an interval Branch & Bound framework with a certified reliability analysis technique. This technique considers the reliability constraint and induced safety region modelled within Probabilistic Continuous Constraint Programming paradigm. The certified reliability analysis is numerically handled by an interval quadrature algorithm. In addition, a new interval quadrature function for two random variables, based on linear models of the safety region is described. Two implementations of the Branch & Bound, which differ on how the certified reliability analysis is handled throughout the optimization process, are presented. A numerical study of these two variants shows the relevance of the interval linear model-based quadrature function.","Benjamin Martin1,2, Marco Correia1 & Jorge Cruz",Journal of Global Optimization,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-017-0529-6,"Reliability-based optimization,Branch & Bound,Interval analysis,Probabilistic constraints"
0,Stochastic stable population growth in integral projection models: theory and application,"Stochastic matrix projection models are widely used to model age- or stage-structured populations with vital rates that fluctuate randomly over time. Practical applications of these models rest on qualitative properties such as the existence of a long term population growth rate, asymptotic log-normality of total population size, and weak ergodicity of population structure. We show here that these properties are shared by a general stochastic integral projection model, by using results in (Eveson in D. Phil. Thesis, University of Sussex, 1991, Eveson in Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. 70, 411–440, 1993) to extend the approach in (Lange and Holmes in J. Appl. Prob. 18, 325–344, 1981). Integral projection models allow individuals to be cross-classified by multiple attributes, either discrete or continuous, and allow the classification to change during the life cycle. These features are present in plant populations with size and age as important predictors of individual fate, populations with a persistent bank of dormant seeds or eggs, and animal species with complex life cycles. We also present a case-study based on a 6-year field study of the Illyrian thistle, Onopordum illyricum, to demonstrate how easily a stochastic integral model can be parameterized from field data and then applied using familiar matrix software and methods. Thistle demography is affected by multiple traits (size, age and a latent “quality” variable), which would be difficult to accomodate in a classical matrix model. We use the model to explore the evolution of size- and age-dependent flowering using an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) approach. We find close agreement between the observed flowering behavior and the predicted ESS from the stochastic model, whereas the ESS predicted from a deterministic version of the model is very different from observed flowering behavior. These results strongly suggest that the flowering strategy in O. illyricum is an adaptation to random between-year variation in vital rates.",Stephen P.

Our work differs from that of others who have developed rather general models for chemotaxis in the use of a non-smooth anisotropic tumbling frequency function that responds biphasically to the combined temporal and spatial chemoattractant gradients. General three-dimensional expressions for the bacterial transport parameters were derived for chemotactic bacteria, followed by a perturbation analysis under the planar geometry. The bacterial random motility and chemotaxis were summarized by a motility tensor and a chemotactic velocity vector, respectively. The consequence of invoking the diffusion-approximation assumption and using intrinsic one-dimensional models with modified cellular swimming speeds was investigated by numerical simulations. Characterizing the bacterial random orientation after tumbles by a turn angle probability distribution function, we found that only the first-order angular moment of this turn angle probability distribution is important in influencing the bacterial long-term transport.

Furthermore, we will assume that such a probability measure is opportunely updated to take into account the increased experience that the agent obtains while exploring the environment, approximating with increasing accuracy the underlying dynamics. Under these assumptions, we will show that the optimal control obtained by solving the “average” linear quadratic optimal control problem with respect to a certain \(\pi \) converges to the optimal control driven related to the linear quadratic optimal control problem governed by the actual, underlying dynamics. This approach is closely related to model-based reinforcement learning algorithms where prior and posterior probability distributions describing the knowledge on the uncertain system are recursively updated.

0,Truthful ownership transfer with expert advice,"When a company undergoes a merger or transfers its ownership, the existing governing body has an opinion on which buyer should take over as the new owner. Similar situations occur while assigning the host of big sports tournaments, like the World Cup or the Olympics. In all these settings, the values of the external bidders are as important as the opinions of the internal experts. Motivated by such scenarios, we consider a social welfare maximizing approach to design and analyze truthful mechanisms in hybrid social choice settings, where payments can be imposed to the bidders, but not to the experts. Since this problem is a combination of mechanism design with and without monetary transfers, classical solutions like VCG cannot be applied, making this a novel mechanism design problem. We consider the simple but fundamental scenario with one expert and two bidders, and provide tight approximation guarantees of the optimal social welfare. We distinguish between mechanisms that use ordinal and cardinal information, as well as between mechanisms that base their decisions on one of the two sides (either the bidders or the expert) or both.

0,An innovative unification process for probabilistic hesitant fuzzy elements and its application to decision making,"The probabilistic hesitant fuzzy element (PHFE) is a worthwhile extension of hesitant fuzzy element (HFE) which is a means of allowing the decision makers more flexibility in expressing their preferences by the use of hesitant information in practical decision making process. To derive a more realistic expression of decision information, it is necessary to unify the arrangement of elements in PHFEs without imposing artificial elements. Up to now, several processes concerning the unification and arrangement of elements in PHFEs have been proposed, and while, most suffer from different drawbacks being critically discussed in the present study. The main aim of this study is to propose a PHFE unification process which does not have the shortcomings of existing processes, and does not change the inherent characteristic of PHFE probabilities. Based on the proposed unification process, the current study seeks to extend the theory of arithmetic operations on PHFEs by proposing and developing novel types of PHFS division and subtraction. Finally, the proposed PHFE unification process is applied to a number of multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems for illustrating its vast range of applicability.",Bahram Farhadinia,Fuzzy Optimization and Decision Making,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10700-021-09369-6,"Probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set,Unification process,Multiple criteria decision making"

In this paper, we show that a decision maker’s attitude towards ambiguity is similarly crucial for investment decisions. We capture the investor’s individual ambiguity attitude by applying α-MEU preferences to a standard investment problem. We show that the presence of ambiguity often leads to an increase in the subjective project value, and entrepreneurs are more eager to invest. Thereby, our investment model helps to explain differences in investment behavior in situations which are objectively identical.",David Schröder,Mathematics and Financial Economics,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11579-011-0036-3,"Investment decision,Ambiguity,Knightian uncertainty,Ambiguity aversion,Optimism,Pessimism,Real option,Dynamic consistency,α-MEU preferences"

In single-objective optimization there exists a global optimum, while in the multi-objective case no optimal solution is clearly defined but rather a set of solutions, called the Pareto-optimal front. Thus, the goal of multi-objective strategies is to generate a set of non-dominated solutions as an approximation to this front. However, the majority of problems of this kind cannot be solved exactly because they have very large and highly complex search spaces. In recent years, meta-heuristics have become important tools for solving multi-objective problems encountered in industry as well as in the theoretical field.

In this context, the main objective of our present work lies in trying to conceive further solutions to solve the problem of the intricate algorithmic complexity imposed during the learning of Bayesian classifiers structure through the use of sophisticated algorithms.

0,"Improving the prediction of complex nonlinear turbulent dynamical systems using nonlinear filter, smoother and backward sampling techniques","Predicting complex nonlinear turbulent dynamical systems using partial observations is an important topic. Despite the simplicity of the forecast based on the ensemble mean time series, several critical shortcomings in the ensemble mean forecast and using path-wise measurements to quantify the prediction error are illustrated in this article. Then, a new ensemble method is developed for improving the long-range forecast. This new approach utilizes a mixture of the posterior distributions from data assimilation and is more skillful in predicting non-Gaussian statistics and extreme events than the traditional method by simply running the forecast model forward. Next, a systematic framework of improving forecast models is established, aiming at advancing the predictions at all ranges. The starting model in this new framework belongs to a rich class of nonlinear systems with conditional Gaussian structures. These models allow an efficient nonlinear smoother for state estimation using partial observations, which in turn facilitates a rapid parameter estimation based on an expectation–maximization algorithm. Conditioned on the partially observed time series, the nonlinear smoother further advances an efficient backward sampling of the hidden trajectories, the dynamical and statistical characteristics from which allow a systematic quantification of model error through information theory. The sampled trajectories then serve as the recovered observations of the hidden variables that promote the use of general nonlinear data-driven modeling techniques for a further improvement of the forecast model. A low-order model of the layered topographic equations with regime switching and rare events is used as a test example to illustrate this framework.",Nan Chen,Research in the Mathematical Sciences,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40687-020-00216-5,"Prediction,Data assimilation,Nonlinear smoother,Backward sampling,Information theory,Extreme events"

With the aim of providing more generality, in a first step, all involved input parameters are assumed to be statistically dependent random variables having an arbitrary joint probability density function. Second, the particular case that just initial conditions are random variables is also analysed. Both problems have common and distinctive feature which are highlighted in our analysis. The study is based on random variable transformation method. As a consequence of our study, the well-known deterministic results are nicely generalized. Several illustrative examples are included.","M.-C. Casabán1, J.-C. Cortés1, J.-V. Romero1 & …M.-D. Roselló

In risk preferences concerning random cash-flows, convexity corresponds to the fundamental diversification principle. Convexity is a basic property also of budget constraints both in classical linear models as well as in more realistic models with transaction costs and constraints. Moreover, modern securities markets are based on trading protocols that result in convex trading costs.

0,Iterated Mixed Strategies and Pascal’s Wager,"Mixed strategies have been used to show that Pascal’s Wager fails to offer sufficient pragmatic reasons for believing in God. Their proponents have argued that, in addition to outright belief in God, rational agents can follow alternatives strategies whose expected utility is infinite as well. One objection that has been raised against this way of blocking Pascal’s Wager is that applying a mixed strategy in Pascal’s case is tantamount to applying an iterated mixed strategy which, properly understood, collapses into the pure strategy of becoming a theist (Monton, Analysis 71:642–645, 2011).

While most theoretical risk models use the concept of time continuity, the practical reality is discrete. For instance, recursive formulas for discretetime models can be obtained without assuming a claim severity distribution and are readily programmable in practice. Hence themodels, techniques used, and results reviewed here for discrete-time risk models are of independent scientific interest. Yet, results for discrete-time risk models can give, in addition, a simpler understanding of their continuous-time analogue. For example, these results can serve as approximations or bounds for the corresponding results in continuous-time models.

(Bull Math Biol 66(6):1621–1644, 2004. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bulm.2004.03.004). Their classification is based on whether each strategy is a Nash equilibrium and whether the fixation probability for a single individual of each strategy is larger or smaller than its value for neutral evolution. We improve on this analysis by showing that each evolutionary scenario is characterized by a definite graph shape for the fixation probability function. A second class of results deals with the behavior of the fixation probability when the population size tends to infinity. We develop asymptotic formulae that approximate the fixation probability in this limit and conclude that some of the evolutionary scenarios cannot exist when the population size is large.","Evandro P. de Souza1, Eliza M.

In particular, a flexible procedure for the generation of insurers’ compressed contract portfolios that respects the given biometric structure is presented, extending the existing literature on stochastic ALM modeling. The introduced balance sheet model is in line with the principles of double-entry bookkeeping as required in accounting. We further focus on the incorporation of new business, i.e. the addition of newly concluded contracts and thus of insured in each period. Efficient simulations are obtained by integrating new policies into existing cohorts according to contract-related criteria. We provide new results on the consistency of the balance sheet equations. In extensive simulation studies for different scenarios regarding the business form of today’s life insurers, we utilize these to analyze the long-term behavior and the stability of the components of the balance sheet for different asset–liability approaches. Finally, we investigate the robustness of two prominent investment strategies against crashes in the capital markets, which lead to extreme liquidity shocks and thus threaten the insurer’s financial health.","Maximilian Diehl1, Roman Horsky2, Susanne Reetz2 & …Jörn Sass

We develop a mathematical model that provides a basis for a rigorous theoretical analysis of these processes as well as for direct simulation. A discrete, stochastic approach is adopted because several molecules appear in small numbers only. Our model is a non-Markovian stochastic process. The main theoretical results include a constructive proof of the existence of the process and a derivation of the rates for initiation and completion of reactions with delays. These results guarantee that the stochastic process is a consistent and realistic description of the molecular system. They also serve as a theoretical justification of recent work on delay stochastic simulation.

Here, a class of approximate deterministic models is introduced into the field of epidemiology that reduces this state space to one that is numerically feasible. However, these reduced state space master equations do not in general form a closed set. To resolve this, the equations are approximated using closure approximations. This process results in a method for constructing deterministic differential equation models with a potentially large scope of application including dynamic directed contact networks and heterogeneous systems using time dependent parameters. The method is exemplified in the case of an SIR (susceptible-infectious-removed) epidemiological model and is numerically evaluated on a range of networks from spatially local to random. In the context of epidemics propagated on contact networks, this work assists in clarifying the link between stochastic simulation and traditional population level deterministic models.","Kieran J.

However, the potential for efficiencies in the implementation, which requires a randomization at each move to create the biwalk, lead us to a different approach that uses fixed patterns in generating the biwalks. We define Sphere and Box Biwalks that are pattern-based and easily implemented for discrete and mixed continuous/discrete domains. The pattern-based Hit-and-Run Markov chains preserve the convergence properties of Hit-and-Run to a target distribution. They also converge to continuous Hit-and-Run as the mesh of the discretized variables becomes finer, approaching a continuum. Moreover, we provide bounds on the finite time performance for the discrete cases of Sphere and Box Biwalks.

As lattice models are spatially discrete models, we address here the problem of invasions trough patchy habitats, where every node in the lattice represents a different patch. Distributed generation times for the individuals are considered, so that different temporal patterns can be studied. Specifically, we explore some examples of seasonal and nonseasonal patterns which may be of ecological interest. The main advantage of the LMs described here is that a direct correspondence between these discrete models and a mesoscopic description of Continuous-Time Random Walks (CTRW) can be found. This point is of great importance, since many times one needs analytical expressions to support or validate numerical results, or vice versa. Finally, that correspondence allows us to provide a discussion about some general aspects of reaction-dispersal models.","Daniel Campos1,2, Vicenç Méndez2 & Vicente Ortega-Cejas",Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-008-9333-2,"Lattice-models,Reactions–diffusion,Traveling fronts"

This limit is shown to be a δ-measure supported by the unit square (Theorem 1). It implies that the majority of partition blocks have approximately the same length.

0,Phylogenetic mixtures and linear invariants for equal input models,"The reconstruction of phylogenetic trees from molecular sequence data relies on modelling site substitutions by a Markov process, or a mixture of such processes. In general, allowing mixed processes can result in different tree topologies becoming indistinguishable from the data, even for infinitely long sequences. However, when the underlying Markov process supports linear phylogenetic invariants, then provided these are sufficiently informative, the identifiability of the tree topology can be restored. In this paper, we investigate a class of processes that support linear invariants once the stationary distribution is fixed, the ‘equal input model’. This model generalizes the ‘Felsenstein 1981’ model (and thereby the Jukes–Cantor model) from four states to an arbitrary number of states (finite or infinite), and it can also be described by a ‘random cluster’ process. We describe the structure and dimension of the vector spaces of phylogenetic mixtures and of linear invariants for any fixed phylogenetic tree (and for all trees—the so called ‘model invariants’), on any number n of leaves. We also provide a precise description of the space of mixtures and linear invariants for the special case of \(n=4\) leaves. By combining techniques from discrete random processes and (multi-) linear algebra, our results build on a classic result that was first established by James Lake (Mol Biol Evol 4:167–191, 1987).",Marta Casanellas1 & Mike Steel,Journal of Mathematical Biology,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-016-1055-8,"Phylogenetic tree,Markov processes,Linear invariants"

0,A Stochastic Game Analysis of the Binary Exponential Backoff Algorithm with Multi-Power Diversity and Transmission Cost,"In this paper, we present a game analysis of the Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB), a popular bandwidth allocation mechanism used by a large number of distributed wireless technologies. A Markov chain analysis is used to obtain equilibrium retransmission probabilities and throughput. Numerical results show that when the arrival probability increases, the behavior of mobile stations MSs become more and more aggressive resulting in a global deterioration of the system throughput. We then consider a non-cooperative game framework to study the operation and evaluate the performance of the BEB algorithm when a group of MSs competing with each other to gain access to the wireless channel. We focus our attention to the case when an MS acts selfishly by attempting to gain access to the channel using a higher retransmission probability as a means to increase its own throughput. As a means to improve the system performance, we further explore the use of two transmission mechanisms and policies. First, we introduce the use of multiple power levels (MPLs) for the data transmission. The use of multiple power levels results on a capture effect allowing the receiver to properly decode the message even in the presence of a collision. Under the proposed scheme, named MPL-BEB, the effect of the aggressive behavior, higher transmission probabilities, is diminished since the power level is chosen randomly and independently by each and every station. Second, we introduce a disutility policy for power consumption. The resulting mechanism, named MPL-BEB with costs, is of prime interest in wireless networks composed of battery-powered nodes. Under this scheme aggressive behavior is discouraged since each retransmission translates into the depletion of the energy stored in the battery. Via price of anarchy, our results identify a behavior similar to the well-know prisoner’s dilemma. A non-efficiency of Nash equilibrium is observed for all schemes (BEB, MPL-BEB, MPL-BEB with costs) under heavy traffic with a notable outperformance of MPL-BEB with costs over both MPL-BEB and BEB.","Abdelillah Karouit1, Essaid Sabir2, Fernando Ramirez-Mireles3, Luis Orozco Barbosa4 & …Abdelkrim Haqiq",Journal of Mathematical Modelling and Algorithms in Operations Research,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10852-012-9190-8,"Random access,Capture effect,Nash equilibrium,Price of anarchy,Stochastic game,BEB algorithm with multi-power diversity,Pricing"

More precisely, we consider a version where the fragmentation stops when the mass of a fragment is below some given threshold, and we study the associated random tree. Dean and Majumdar found a phase transition for this process: the number of fragmentations is asymptotically normal for some dislocation laws but not for others, depending on the position of roots of a certain characteristic equation. This parallels the behavior of discrete analogues with various random trees that have been studied in computer science. We give rigorous proofs of this phase transition, and add further details.

We propose a characterization of the reciprocal class as the unique set of probability measures on which a family of time and space transformations induces the same density, expressed in terms of the reciprocal invariants. The geometry of \(\mathcal {A}\) plays a crucial role in the design of the transformations, and we use tools from discrete geometry to obtain an optimal characterization. We deduce explicit conditions for two Markov jump processes to belong to the same class. Finally, we provide a natural interpretation of the invariants as short-time asymptotics for the probability that the reference process makes a cycle around its current state.","Giovanni Conforti1, Paolo Dai Pra2 & Sylvie Rœlly",Journal of Theoretical Probability,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10959-015-0655-3,"Reciprocal processes,Stochastic bridges,Jump processes,Compound Poisson processes"

0,The uniqueness of protein sequences: A Monte Carlo analysis,"Amino acid sequences have already been examined in some detail in order to relate them to structural aspects, homology and gene duplication. This report introduces the concept of internal uniqueness of tripeptides within protein sequences and uses the Monte Carlo method to study this property. Some idea of internal uniqueness may be obtained from such an analysis using only a single sequence if the probability of the random occurrence is about 0.001 or less. This method of analysis is similar to that used in quantitative evaluations of homology. When the probability of the random occurrence is larger than 0.001 a homologous group of sequences is required and the random probabilities may be compared with the real occurrences within the group. From such an examination insulin and cytochrome c are identified as protein sequences with high internal uniqueness.A comparison of data from internal uniqueness and gene duplication analyses shows that these two properties need not be related. Results of the analysis point to internal uniqueness as an additional parameter for inclusion in speculations on why twenty amino acids are coded in protein structure.",H. A. Saroff1 & F. A.

0,Bifurcation Analysis of Models with Uncertain Function Specification: How Should We Proceed?,"When we investigate the bifurcation structure of models of natural phenomena, we usually assume that all model functions are mathematically specified and that the only existing uncertainty is with respect to the parameters of these functions. In this case, we can split the parameter space into domains corresponding to qualitatively similar dynamics, separated by bifurcation hypersurfaces. On the other hand, in the biological sciences, the exact shape of the model functions is often unknown, and only some qualitative properties of the functions can be specified: mathematically, we can consider that the unknown functions belong to a specific class of functions. However, the use of two different functions belonging to the same class can result in qualitatively different dynamical behaviour in the model and different types of bifurcation. In the literature, the conventional way to avoid such ambiguity is to narrow the class of unknown functions, which allows us to keep patterns of dynamical behaviour consistent for varying functions. The main shortcoming of this approach is that the restrictions on the model functions are often given by cumbersome expressions and are strictly model-dependent: biologically, they are meaningless. In this paper, we suggest a new framework (based on the ODE paradigm) which allows us to investigate deterministic biological models in which the mathematical formulation of some functions is unspecified except for some generic qualitative properties. We demonstrate that in such models, the conventional idea of revealing a concrete bifurcation structure becomes irrelevant: we can only describe bifurcations with a certain probability. We then propose a method to define the probability of a bifurcation taking place when there is uncertainty in the parameterisation in our model. As an illustrative example, we consider a generic predator–prey model where the use of different parameterisations of the logistic-type prey growth function can result in different dynamics in terms of the type of the Hopf bifurcation through which the coexistence equilibrium loses stability. Using this system, we demonstrate a framework for evaluating the probability of having a supercritical or subcritical Hopf bifurcation.","M. W. Adamson1 & A. Yu.

0,"A Mathematical Framework for Critical Transitions: Normal Forms, Variance and Applications","Critical transitions occur in a wide variety of applications including mathematical biology, climate change, human physiology and economics. Therefore it is highly desirable to find early-warning signs. We show that it is possible to classify critical transitions by using bifurcation theory and normal forms in the singular limit. Based on this elementary classification, we analyze stochastic fluctuations and calculate scaling laws of the variance of stochastic sample paths near critical transitions for fast-subsystem bifurcations up to codimension two. The theory is applied to several models: the Stommel–Cessi box model for the thermohaline circulation from geoscience, an epidemic-spreading model on an adaptive network, an activator–inhibitor switch from systems biology, a predator–prey system from ecology and to the Euler buckling problem from classical mechanics. For the Stommel–Cessi model we compare different detrending techniques to calculate early-warning signs. In the epidemics model we show that link densities could be better variables for prediction than population densities. The activator–inhibitor switch demonstrates effects in three time-scale systems and points out that excitable cells and molecular units have information for subthreshold prediction. In the predator–prey model explosive population growth near a codimension-two bifurcation is investigated and we show that early-warnings from normal forms can be misleading in this context. In the biomechanical model we demonstrate that early-warning signs for buckling depend crucially on the control strategy near the instability which illustrates the effect of multiplicative noise.","Christian Kuehn1,",Journal of Nonlinear Science,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00332-012-9158-x,"Critical transition,Tipping point,Fast-slow system,Invariant manifold,Stochastic differential equation,Multiple time scales,Moment estimates,Asymptotic analysis,Laplace integral,Thermohaline circulation,Activator–inhibitor system,Adaptive networks,SIS-epidemics,Bazykin predator–prey model,Euler buckling"

0,A Kalman particle filter for online parameter estimation with applications to affine models,"In this paper we address the problem of estimating the posterior distribution of the static parameters of a continuous-time state space model with discrete-time observations by an algorithm that combines the Kalman filter and a particle filter. The proposed algorithm is semi-recursive and has a two layer structure, in which the outer layer provides the estimation of the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters and the inner layer provides the estimation of the posterior distribution of the state variables. This algorithm has a similar structure as the so-called recursive nested particle filter, but unlike the latter filter, in which both layers use a particle filter, our algorithm introduces a dynamic kernel to sample the parameter particles in the outer layer to obtain a higher convergence speed. Moreover, this algorithm also implements the Kalman filter in the inner layer to reduce the computational time. This algorithm can also be used to estimate the parameters that suddenly change value. We prove that, for a state space model with a certain structure, the estimated posterior distribution of the unknown parameters and the state variables converge to the actual distribution in \(L^p\) with rate of order \({\mathcal {O}}(N^{-\frac{1}{2}}+\varDelta ^{\frac{1}{2}})\), where N is the number of particles for the parameters in the outer layer and \(\varDelta \) is the maximum time step between two consecutive observations. We present numerical results of the implementation of this algorithm, in particularly we implement this algorithm for affine interest models, possibly with stochastic volatility, although the algorithm can be applied to a much broader class of models.","Jian He

The virus is transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, but direct (sexual) transmission has been documented. We formulate a reaction diffusion model that considers spatial movement of humans and vectors, with local contact transmission of Zika virus. Vaccination is introduced as a control variable, giving immunity to susceptible humans, in order to characterize an optimal vaccination strategy that minimizes the costs associated with infections and vaccines. The optimal control characterization is obtained in terms of state and adjoint equations.

This problem is analogous to that of a Chaplygin sleigh when the nonholonomic constraint prohibiting motions of the fixed point on the platform across the direction prescribed on it is replaced by viscous friction. We present numerical results which confirm correspondence between the phenomenology of complex dynamics of the model with a nonholonomic constraint and a system with viscous friction — phase portraits of attractors, bifurcation diagram, and Lyapunov exponents. In particular, we show the possibility of the platform’s motion being accelerated by oscillations of the internal mass, although, in contrast to the nonholonomic model, the effect of acceleration tends to saturation. We also show the possibility of chaotic dynamics related to strange attractors of equations for generalized velocities, which is accompanied by a two-dimensional random walk of the platform in a laboratory reference system. The results obtained may be of interest to applications in the context of the problem of developing robotic mechanisms for motion in a fluid under the action of the motions of internal masses.","Alexey V.

Despite the popularity of this method, useful theoretical estimates for its rate of convergence are still scarce. We introduce a randomized version of the Kaczmarz method for consistent, overdetermined linear systems and we prove that it converges with expected exponential rate. Furthermore, this is the first solver whose rate does not depend on the number of equations in the system. The solver does not even need to know the whole system but only a small random part of it. It thus outperforms all previously known methods on general extremely overdetermined systems.

0,A Stochastic Model of Gene Evolution with Time Dependent Pseudochaotic Mutations,"We develop here a new class of stochastic models of gene evolution in which a random subset of the 64 possible trinucleotides mutates at each evolutionary time t according to some time dependent substitution probabilities. Therefore, at each time t, the numbers and the types of mutable trinucleotides are unknown. Thus, the mutation matrix changes at each time t. This pseudochaotic model developed generalizes the standard model in which all the trinucleotides mutate at each time t. It determines the occurrence probabilities at time t of trinucleotides which pseudochaotically mutate according to 3 time dependent substitution parameters associated with the 3 trinucleotide sites. The main result proves that under suitable assumptions, this pseudochaotic model converges to a uniform probability vector identical to that of the standard model. Furthermore, an application of this pseudochaotic model allows an evolutionary study of the 3 circular codes identified in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes. A circular code is a particular set of trinucleotides whose main property is the retrieval of the frames in genes locally, i.e., anywhere in genes and particularly without start codons, and automatically with a window of a few nucleotides. After a certain evolutionary time and with particular time dependent functions for the 3 substitution parameters, precisely an exponential decrease in the 1st and 2nd trinucleotide sites and an exponential increase in the 3rd one, this pseudochaotic model retrieves the main statistical properties of the 3 circular codes observed in genes. Furthermore, it leads to a circular code asymmetry stronger than the standard model (nonpseudochaotic) and, therefore, to a better correlation with the genes.",Jacques M. Bahi1 & Christian J.

We describe an approach to adaptive sensing based on approximately solving a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) formulation of the problem. Such approximations are necessary because of the very large state space involved in practical adaptive sensing problems, precluding exact computation of optimal solutions. We review the theory of POMDPs and show how the theory applies to adaptive sensing problems. We then describe a variety of approximation methods, with examples to illustrate their application in adaptive sensing. The examples also demonstrate the gains that are possible from nonmyopic methods relative to myopic methods, and highlight some insights into the dependence of such gains on the sensing resources and environment.","Edwin K.

0,A practical approach to parameter estimation applied to model predicting heart rate regulation,"Mathematical models have long been used for prediction of dynamics in biological systems. Recently, several efforts have been made to render these models patient specific. One way to do so is to employ techniques to estimate parameters that enable model based prediction of observed quantities. Knowledge of variation in parameters within and between groups of subjects have potential to provide insight into biological function. Often it is not possible to estimate all parameters in a given model, in particular if the model is complex and the data is sparse. However, it may be possible to estimate a subset of model parameters reducing the complexity of the problem. In this study, we compare three methods that allow identification of parameter subsets that can be estimated given a model and a set of data. These methods will be used to estimate patient specific parameters in a model predicting baroreceptor feedback regulation of heart rate during head-up tilt. The three methods include: structured analysis of the correlation matrix, analysis via singular value decomposition followed by QR factorization, and identification of the subspace closest to the one spanned by eigenvectors of the model Hessian. Results showed that all three methods facilitate identification of a parameter subset. The “best” subset was obtained using the structured correlation method, though this method was also the most computationally intensive. Subsets obtained using the other two methods were easier to compute, but analysis revealed that the final subsets contained correlated parameters. In conclusion, to avoid lengthy computations, these three methods may be combined for efficient identification of parameter subsets.","Mette S. Olufsen1,2 & Johnny T.

The per capita death rate depends on the organism’s size, as for example when the main cause of death is predation. In the analysis of the net production model, the size at maturity is calculated along with the probability of reaching that size. We show that a small probability of survival to maturity is incompatible with the simple assumption of an exponential survival probability. We demonstrate that when the hazard rate is significantly greater for small individuals than large ones, it is possible for the optimum strategy to be for an individual to grow to a large size in spite of an arbitrarily small probability of survival to maturity. Numerical simulations indicate how the optimal allocation strategies depend on the parameter values.","Glenn Ledder1, J.

The general jury theorem also indicates that given two groups of individuals with the same average probability of making the correct choice, the one with a more varied or diverse distribution of probabilities will have a higher probability of making the correct choice. In particular, we proved that as the number of decision makers in the group increases to infinity, this probability tends to the limit 1.

On the study of the operator’s kernel some progress has been achieved for some specific classes of singular integral operators whose properties allow the use of particular strategies. However, the existing algorithms allow, in general, to study the dimension of the kernel of some classes of singular integral operators but are not designed to be implemented on a computer. The main goal of this paper is to show how the symbolic and numeric capabilities of a computer algebra system can be used to study the kernel of special classes of paired singular integral operators with essentially bounded coefficients defined on the unit circle. It is described how some factorization algorithms can be used to compute the dimension of the kernel of special classes of singular integral operators. The analytical algorithms [ADimKerPaired-Scalar], [AKerPaired-Scalar], and [ADimKerPaired-Matrix] are presented. The design of these new algorithms was focused on the possibility of implementing on a computer all the extensive symbolic and numeric calculations present in the algorithms.

In recent publications, its efficiency has been shown on different types of combinatorial optimization problems like routing, machine scheduling and covering. In this paper the FSS is adapted to multi-objective problems for finding Pareto Front approximations. This adaptation is illustrated for the bi-objective Minimum Weighted Vertex Cover Problem (MWVCP). In this work, a simple and effective bi-objective GRASP algorithm for the MWVCP is developed in the first stage. One important characteristic of the proposed GRASP is that it avoids the use of weighted sums of objective functions in the local search and the greedy algorithm. In the second stage, the bi-objective GRASP is extended to the FSS by adding a learning mechanism adapted to multi-objective problems. The conducted computational experiments show that the proposed FSS and GRASP algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods for the bi-objective MWVCP.

0,Feasibility preserving constraint-handling strategies for real parameter evolutionary optimization,"Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are being routinely applied for a variety of optimization tasks, and real-parameter optimization in the presence of constraints is one such important area. During constrained optimization EAs often create solutions that fall outside the feasible region; hence a viable constraint-handling strategy is needed. This paper focuses on the class of constraint-handling strategies that repair infeasible solutions by bringing them back into the search space and explicitly preserve feasibility of the solutions. Several existing constraint-handling strategies are studied, and two new single parameter constraint-handling methodologies based on parent-centric and inverse parabolic probability (IP) distribution are proposed. The existing and newly proposed constraint-handling methods are first studied with PSO, DE, GAs, and simulation results on four scalable test-problems under different location settings of the optimum are presented. The newly proposed constraint-handling methods exhibit robustness in terms of performance and also succeed on search spaces comprising up-to \(500\) variables while locating the optimum within an error of \(10^{-10}\). The working principle of the IP based methods is also demonstrated on (i) some generic constrained optimization problems, and (ii) a classic ‘Weld’ problem from structural design and mechanics. The successful performance of the proposed methods clearly exhibits their efficacy as a generic constrained-handling strategy for a wide range of applications.","Nikhil Padhye1, Pulkit Mittal2 & Kalyanmoy Deb",Computational Optimization and Applications,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10589-015-9752-6,"Constraint-handling,Nonlinear and constrained optimization,Particle swarm optimization,Real-parameter genetic algorithms,Differential evolution"

We assume the firm finances its risky assets by mainly issuing short- and long-term debt. Short-term debt can have either a discrete or a more realistic staggered tenor structure. At rollover dates of short-term debt, creditors face a dynamic coordination problem. We show that a unique threshold strategy (i.e., a debt run barrier) exists for short-term creditors to decide when to withdraw their funding, and this strategy is closely related to the solution of a non-standard optimal stopping time problem with control constraints. We decompose the total credit risk into an insolvency component and an illiquidity component based on such an endogenous debt run barrier together with an exogenous insolvency barrier.","Gechun Liang1, Eva Lütkebohmert2 & Wei Wei",Mathematics and Financial Economics,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11579-015-0144-6,"Structural credit risk model,Debt run,Liquidity risk,First passage time,Optimal stopping time"
0,Cyclic Negative Feedback Systems: What is the Chance of Oscillation?,"Many biological oscillators have a cyclic structure consisting of negative feedback loops. In this paper, we analyze the impact that the addition of a positive or a negative self-feedback loop has on the oscillatory behavior of the three negative feedback oscillators proposed by Tsai et al. (Science 231:126–129, 2008) where, in contrast with numerous oscillator models, the interactions between elements occur via the modulation of the degradation rates. Through analytical and computational studies we show that an additional self-feedback affects the oscillatory behavior. In the high-cooperativity limit, i.e., for large Hill coefficients, we derive exact analytical conditions for oscillations and show that the relative location between the dissociation constants of the Hill functions and the ratio of kinetic parameters determines the possibility of oscillatory activities. We compute analytically the probability of oscillations for the three models and show that the smallest domain of periodic behavior is obtained for the negative-plus-negative feedback system whereas the additional positive self-feedback loop does not modify significantly the chance to oscillate. We numerically investigate to what extent the properties obtained in the sharp situation applied in the smooth case. Results suggest that a switch-like coupling behavior, a time-scale separation, and a repressilator-type architecture with an even number of elements facilitate the emergence of sustained oscillations in biological systems. An additional positive self-feedback loop produces robustness and adaptability whereas an additional negative self-feedback loop reduces the chance to oscillate.",Arnaud Tonnelier,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-014-9959-1,"Oscillation,Feedback,Limit cycle,Repressilator, Helmholtz decomposition"

0,A multistage stochastic programming asset-liability management model: an application to the Brazilian pension fund industry,This paper proposes a multistage stochastic programming approach for the asset-liability management of Brazilian pension funds. We generate asset price scenarios with stochastic differential equations—Geometric Brownian Motion model for stocks and Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model for fixed income securities. Intertemporal solvency regulatory rules for Brazilian pension funds are considered endogenously in the model and enforced with a combinatorial constraint. A VaR probabilistic constraint is incorporated to obtain a positive funding ratio at each time period with high probability. Our approach uses multiple trees to provide a representative characterization of the uncertainty and is not computationally prohibitive. We evaluate the insolvency probability under different initial funding ratios through extensive simulations. The study reveals that the likely decrease of interest rate premiums in the next years will force pension fund managers to significantly change their portfolio strategies.

When discussing such a more general supermarket model, this paper makes some new results and advances as follows: (1) Providing a detailed probability analysis for setting up an infinite-dimensional system of differential vector equations satisfied by the expected fraction vector, where the invariance of environment factors is given as an important result.

Finally, we use some numerical examples to illustrate how the performance measures of this supermarket model depend on the non-Poisson inputs and on the non-exponential service times.

participants at one of time points known in advance. The cost functional may depend both on the
time when the game ends and the position of the system at that time and on the player who
initiates the game stopping. When optimizing the expectation of this functional, each player,
based on the information the player has about the realized trajectory of the system, makes
decisions both about his/her probability of stopping the game and about his/her own control of
the conflict-controlled system; however, nondeterministic distribution rules are also allowed. The
existence of the game value is shown under the assumption of a saddle point condition in the small
game (the Isaacs condition). The construction of a stochastic guide whose model is a
continuous-time Markov chain was used to construct approximately optimal strategies for the

0,A topological approach to inferring the intrinsic dimension of convex sensing data,"We consider a common measurement paradigm, where an unknown subset of an affine space is measured by unknown continuous quasi-convex functions. Given the measurement data, can one determine the dimension of this space? In this paper, we develop a method for inferring the intrinsic dimension of the data from measurements by quasi-convex functions, under natural assumptions. The dimension inference problem depends only on discrete data of the ordering of the measured points of space, induced by the sensor functions. We construct a filtration of Dowker complexes, associated to measurements by quasi-convex functions. Topological features of these complexes are then used to infer the intrinsic dimension. We prove convergence theorems that guarantee obtaining the correct intrinsic dimension in the limit of large data, under natural assumptions. We also illustrate the usability of this method in simulations.",Min-Chun Wu1 & Vladimir Itskov,Journal of Applied and Computational Topology,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41468-021-00081-3,"Convex sensing,Dowker complex,Dimension estimate,Topological inference,Random topology"
0,"Analysis of a continuous time SM[K]/PH[K]/1/FCFS queue: Age process, sojourn times, and queue lengths","This paper studies a continuous time queueing system with multiple types of customers and a first-come-first-served service discipline. Customers arrive according to a semi-Markov arrival process and the service times of individual types of customers have PH-distributions. A GI /M/1 type Markov process for a generalized age process of batches of customers is constructed. The stationary distribution of the GI /M/1 type Markov process is found explicitly and, consequently, the distributions of the age of the batch in service, the total workload in the system, waiting times, and sojourn times of different batches and different types of customers are obtained. The paper gives the matrix representations of the PH-distributions of waiting times and sojourn times. Some results are obtained for the distributions of queue lengths at departure epochs and at an arbitrary time. These results can be used to analyze not only the queue length, but also the composition of the queue. Computational methods are developed for calculating steady state distributions related to the queue lengths, sojourn times, and waiting times.",Qiming He,Journal of Systems Science and Complexity,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-012-9138-0,"

0,The stable doubly infinite pedigree process of supercritical branching populations,"An individual is sampled randomly from a supercritical general branching population and the pedigree process, which centers around this ‘ego’-individual, is studied. The process describes not only lineage backwards and forwards, but also the lives of all individuals involved. Under mild conditions and in several senses, the process is shown to stabilize, as time passes. The limit is a doubly infinite population process, which generalizes the stable age distribution of branching processes and demography. It displays a nice independence structure, and can easily be constructed from the original branching law. The results are applied to certain kin-number problems, the process of ego's ancestors' births, and to the FLM-curve of cell kinetics.","Olle Nerman1,2 & Peter Jagers1,",Zeitschrift für Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Verwandte Gebiete,1984,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00533746,"Point Process,Cell Kinetic,Left Limit,Birth Time,Life Space"
0,Local approximation of a metapopulation’s equilibrium,"We consider the approximation of the equilibrium of a metapopulation model, in which a finite number of patches are randomly distributed over a bounded subset \(\Omega \) of Euclidean space. The approximation is good when a large number of patches contribute to the colonization pressure on any given unoccupied patch, and when the quality of the patches varies little over the length scale determined by the colonization radius. If this is the case, the equilibrium probability of a patch at z being occupied is shown to be close to \(q_1(z)\), the equilibrium occupation probability in Levins’s model, at any point \(z \in \Omega \) not too close to the boundary, if the local colonization pressure and extinction rates appropriate to z are assumed. The approximation is justified by giving explicit upper and lower bounds for the occupation probabilities, expressed in terms of the model parameters. Since the patches are distributed randomly, the occupation probabilities are also random, and we complement our bounds with explicit bounds on the probability that they are satisfied at all patches simultaneously.","A.

0,Deducing the Density Hales–Jewett Theorem from an Infinitary Removal Lemma,"We offer a new proof of Furstenberg and Katznelson’s density version of the Hales–Jewett Theorem:
Theorem
For any
δ>0 there is some
N
0≥1 such that whenever
A⊆[k]N
with
N≥N
0
and |A|≥δk
N, A
contains a combinatorial line, that is, for some
I⊆[N] nonempty and
w
0∈[k][N]∖I
we have
$$A \supseteq \{w:\ w|_{[N]\setminus I} = w_0,\,w|_I = \mathrm{const.}\}.$$
Following Furstenberg and Katznelson, we first show that this result is equivalent to a ‘multiple recurrence’ assertion for a class of probability measures enjoying a certain kind of stationarity. However, we then give a quite different proof of this latter assertion through a reduction to an infinitary removal lemma in the spirit of Tao (J. Anal. Math. 103, 1–45, 2007) (and also its recent re-interpretation in (J. Anal. Math., to appear)). This reduction is based on a structural analysis of these stationary laws closely analogous to the classical representation theorems for various partially exchangeable stochastic processes in the sense of Hoover (Relations on probability spaces and arrays of random variables, 1979), Aldous (in Exchangeability in Probability and Statistics, 165–170, 1982; Lecture Notes in Math. 1117, 1–198, 1985) and Kallenberg (J. Theor. Probab. 5(4), 727–765, 1992). However, the underlying combinatorial arguments used to prove this theorem are rather different from those required to work with exchangeable arrays, and involve crucially an observation that arose during ongoing work by a collaborative team of authors (http://gowers.wordpress.com/) to give a purely finitary proof of the above theorem.",Tim Austin,Journal of Theoretical Probability,2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10959-011-0373-4,"Exchangeability,Ergodic Ramsey theory,Density Hales–Jewett"
0,A penalty function-based differential evolution algorithm for constrained global optimization,"We propose a differential evolution-based algorithm for constrained global optimization. Although differential evolution has been used as the underlying global solver, central to our approach is the penalty function that we introduce. The adaptive nature of the penalty function makes the results of the algorithm mostly insensitive to low values of the penalty parameter. We have also demonstrated both empirically and theoretically that the high value of the penalty parameter is detrimental to convergence, specially for functions with multiple local minimizers. Hence, the penalty function can dispense with the penalty parameter. We have extensively tested our penalty function-based DE algorithm on a set of 24 benchmark test problems. Results obtained are compared with those of some recent algorithms.",M. M. Ali1 & W. X.

We prove that the annealed law of the empirical measure on path space of these dynamics satisfy a large deviation principle in the high temperature regime. We study the rate function of this large deviation principle and prove that it achieves its minimum value at a unique probability measureQ which is not markovian. We deduce that the quenched law of the empirical measure converges to δ

0,Stable Lévy Motion with Values in the Skorokhod Space: Construction and Approximation,"In this article, we introduce an infinite-dimensional analogue of the \(\alpha \)-stable Lévy motion, defined as a Lévy process \(Z=\{Z(t)\}_{t \ge 0}\) with values in the space \({\mathbb {D}}\) of càdlàg functions on [0, 1], equipped with Skorokhod’s \(J_1\) topology. For each \(t \ge 0\), Z(t) is an \(\alpha \)-stable process with sample paths in \({\mathbb {D}}\), denoted by \(\{Z(t,s)\}_{s\in [0,1]}\). Intuitively, Z(t, s) gives the value of the process Z at time t and location s in space. This process is closely related to the concept of regular variation for random elements in \({\mathbb {D}}\) introduced in de Haan and Lin (Ann Probab 29:467–483, 2001) and Hult and Lindskog (Stoch Proc Appl 115:249–274, 2005). We give a construction of Z based on a Poisson random measure, and we show that Z has a modification whose sample paths are càdlàg functions on \([0,\infty )\) with values in \({\mathbb {D}}\). Finally, we prove a functional limit theorem which identifies the distribution of this modification as the limit of the partial sum sequence \(\{S_n(t)=\sum _{i=1}^{[nt]}X_i\}_{t\ge 0}\), suitably normalized and centered, associated with a sequence \((X_i)_{i\ge 1}\) of i.i.d. regularly varying elements in \({\mathbb {D}}\).","Raluca M.

0,Spiking the random matrix hard edge,"We characterize the limiting smallest eigenvalue distributions (or hard edge laws) for sample covariance type matrices drawn from a spiked population. In the case of a single spike, the results are valid in the context of the general \(\beta \) ensembles. For multiple spikes, the necessary construction restricts matters to real, complex or quaternion (\(\beta =1,2,\) or 4) ensembles. The limit laws are described in terms of random integral operators, and partial differential equations satisfied by the corresponding distribution functions are derived as corollaries. We also show that, under a natural limit, all spiked hard edge laws derived here degenerate to the critically spiked soft edge laws (or deformed Tracy–Widom laws). The latter were first described at \(\beta =2\) by Baik, Ben Arous, and Peché (Ann Probab 33:1643–1697, 2005), and from a unified \(\beta \) random operator point of view by Bloemendal and Virág (Probab Theory Relat Fields 156:795–825, 2013; Ann Probab arXiv:1109.3704, 2011).","José A.

We focus on the case where θ is a continuous parameter, and also consider estimation of the derivative α′(θ). One approach for doing that, when θ is a parameter of the probability law that governs the system, is based on the use of likelihood ratios and score functions. In this paper, we study a different approach, called split-and-merge, for the case where θ is a threshold parameter. This approach can be viewed as a practical way of running parallel simulations at an infinite number of values of θ, with common random numbers. We give several examples showing how different kinds of parameters such as the arrival rate in a queue, the probability that an arriving customer be of a given type, a scale parameter of a service time distribution, and so on, can be turned into threshold parameters.

With this stopping rule, we construct several confidence intervals for D by difference procedures. Some bias reduction techniques are used to modify the confidence intervals.

0,Kinetically constrained spin models,"We analyze the density and size dependence of the relaxation time for kinetically constrained spin models (KCSM) intensively studied in the physics literature as simple models sharing some of the features of the glass transition. KCSM are interacting particle systems on \({\mathbb{Z}}^d\) with Glauber-like dynamics, reversible w.r.t. a simple product i.i.d Bernoulli(p) measure. The essential feature of a KCSM is that the creation/destruction of a particle at a given site can occur only if the current configuration around it satisfies certain constraints which completely define each specific model. No other interaction is present in the model. From the mathematical point of view, the basic issues concerning positivity of the spectral gap inside the ergodicity region and its scaling with the particle density p remained open for most KCSM (with the notably exception of the East model in d = 1; Aldous and Diaconis in J Stat Phys 107(5–6):945–975, 2002). Here for the first time we: (i) identify the ergodicity region by establishing a connection with an associated bootstrap percolation model; (ii) develop a novel multi-scale approach which proves positivity of the spectral gap in the whole ergodic region; (iii) establish, sometimes optimal, bounds on the behavior of the spectral gap near the boundary of the ergodicity region and (iv) establish pure exponential decay at equilibrium for the persistence function, i.e. the probability that the occupation variable at the origin does not change before time t.
