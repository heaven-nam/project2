## Introduction

MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. It is
a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.5+**.

<details open>
<summary>Major features</summary>

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the detection framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized object detection framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple frameworks out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary detection frameworks, *e.g.* Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, RetinaNet, etc.

- **High efficiency**

  All basic bbox and mask operations run on GPUs. The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases, including [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark) and [SimpleDet](https://github.com/TuSimple/simpledet).

- **State of the art**

  The toolbox stems from the codebase developed by the *MMDet* team, who won [COCO Detection Challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard) in 2018, and we keep pushing it forward.

</details>

Apart from MMDetection, we also released a library [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) for computer vision research, which is heavily depended on by this toolbox.

## What's New

**2.25.0** was released in 1/6/2022:

- Support dedicated `MMDetWandbHook` hook
- Support [ConvNeXt](configs/convnext), [DDOD](configs/ddod), [SOLOv2](configs/solov2)
- Support [Mask2Former](configs/mask2former) for instance segmentation
- Rename [config files of Mask2Former](configs/mask2former)

Please refer to [changelog.md](docs/en/changelog.md) for details and release history.

For compatibility changes between different versions of MMDetection, please refer to [compatibility.md](docs/en/compatibility.md).
