0,Blow-up analysis for approximate Dirac-harmonic maps in dimension 2 with applications to the Dirac-harmonic heat flow,"Dirac-harmonic maps couple a second order harmonic map type system with a first nonlinear Dirac equation. We consider approximate Dirac-harmonic maps \(\{(\phi _n,\psi _n)\}\), that is, maps that satisfy the Dirac-harmonic system up to controlled error terms. We show that such approximate Dirac-harmonic maps defined on a Riemann surface, that is, in dimension 2, continue to satisfy the basic properties of blow-up analysis like the energy identity and the no neck property. The assumptions are such that they hold for solutions of the heat flow of Dirac-harmonic maps. That flow turns the harmonic map type system into a parabolic system, but simply keeps the Dirac equation as a nonlinear first order constraint along the flow. As a corollary of the main result of this paper, when such a flow blows up at infinite time at interior points, we obtain an energy identity and the no neck property."
0,On harmonic analysis of causal operators,We follow the group representation theory approach to define causal operators on Banach modules and present some of their spectral properties.
0,Harmonic analysis on the infinite-dimensional unitary group,"The goal of harmonic analysis on the infinite-dimensional unitary group is to decompose a certain family of unitary representations of this group, which is a substitute for the nonexisting regular representations and depends on two complex parameters (Olshanski, 2003). In the case of noninteger parameters, the decomposing measure is described in terms of determinantal point processes (Borondin and Olshanski, 2005). The aim of the present paper is to describe the decomposition for integer parameters; in this case, the spectrum of the decompositions changes drastically. A similar result was earlier obtained for the infinite symmetric group (Kerov, Olshanski, and Vershik, 2004), but the case of the unitary group turned out to be much more complicated. In the proof we use Gustafson’s multilateral summation formula for hypergeometric series. Bibliography: 6 titles."

0,Symmetry problems in harmonic analysis,"Symmetry problems in harmonic analysis are formulated and solved. One of these problems is equivalent to the refined Schiffer’s conjecture which was recently proved by the author. Let \(k=const>0\) be fixed, \(S^2\) be the unit sphere in \({\mathbb R}^3\), D be a connected bounded domain with \(C^2-\)smooth connected boundary S, \(j_0(r)\) be the spherical Bessel function. The harmonic analysis symmetry problems are stated in the following theorems. Theorem A Assume that \(\int _S e^{ik\beta \cdot s}ds=0\) for all \(\beta \in S^2\). Then S is a sphere of radius a, where \(j_0(ka)=0\). Theorem B Assume that \(\int _D e^{ik\beta \cdot x}dx=0\) for all \(\beta \in S^2\). Then D is a ball."
0,Homotopy analysis approach to Duffing-harmonic oscillator,This paper uses the homotopy analysis for the Duffing-harmonic oscillator. The auxiliary parameter in the deformation equation is numerically determined. The response and the frequency of the Duffing-harmonic oscillator are calculated. The analytical results are validated in numerical simulations.
0,Analysis method of chaos and sub-harmonic resonance of nonlinear system without small parameters,"The Melnikov method is important for detecting the presence of transverse homoclinic orbits and the occurrence of homoclinic bifurcations. Unfortunately, the traditional Melnikov methods strongly depend on small parameters, which do not exist in most practical systems. Those methods are limited in dealing with the systems with strong nonlinearities. This paper presents a procedure to study the chaos and sub-harmonic resonance of strongly nonlinear practical systems by employing a homotopy method that is used to extend the Melnikov functions to the strongly nonlinear systems. Applied to a given example, the procedure shows the effectiveness via the comparison of the theoretical results and the numerical simulation."

0,Integration of a zonal function related to the local harmonic analysis on spheres,"In studying local harmonic analysis on the sphere Sn, R.S. Strichartz introduced certain zonal functions ϕ2(d(x, y)) which satisfy the equation\(\Delta _z \varphi _h \left( {d\left( {x,y} \right)} \right) = \mu \cdot \varphi _h \left( {d\left( {x,y} \right)} \right) + a\left( \lambda \right) \cdot \delta _{ - y} \left( x \right), \mu = \sigma ^2 - \lambda ^2 ,0 = \frac{{n - 1}}{2}\), where Δz is the Laplace operator and δ−y the Dirac measure. The explicit expression of the constant a (λ) is given by R.S. Strichartz in the case that n is odd. Appyling the Apéry identity, we show in this paper that\(a\left( \lambda \right) = \frac{2}{\pi }( - 1)^{\pi + \frac{1}{2}} \cdot \omega _{\pi - 1} \gamma _\pi ^2 \left\{ {\prod\limits_{k = 0}^{\pi - 3/2} {\left( {\lambda ^2 - (k + \frac{1}{2})^2 } \right)^{} } } \right\}^{ - 1} \cdot \cos \left( {\pi \lambda } \right)\) for n even, where wn-1 is the surface area of Sn-1,\(\gamma _n = \left( {n - 2} \right) \cdot \left( {n - 4} \right) \cdots 2\)."

0,Reduced synthesis in harmonic analysis and compact synthesis in operator theory,"The notion of reduced synthesis in the context of harmonic analysis on general locally compact groups is introduced; in the classical situation of commutative groups, this notion means that a function f in the Fourier algebra is annihilated by any pseudofunction supported on f −1(0). A relationship between reduced synthesis and compact synthesis (i.e., the possibility of approximating compact operators by pseudointegral ones without increasing the support) is determined, which makes it possible to obtain new results both in operator theory and in harmonic analysis. Applications to the theory of linear operator equations are also given."
0,A Fortran computer programme for spherical harmonic analysis of geomagnetic field by numerical integration,"A computer program in Fortran IV language for evaluating the spherical harmonic coefficients from grid values of the field componentsX, Y andZ over the surface of a sphere and for separating the harmonic coefficients into ‘internal’ and ‘external’ part is detailed. The method of “Numerical integration” using orthogonality relations of the associated Legendre functions is adopted wherein arbitrary relative weights for observations generally used in the method of “least squares” is eliminated and the derived coefficients are independent of the number of terms retained in the series. The computer program is tested for correctness using the charted values of the field components for two epochs 1945·0 and 1965·0."

0,Practical methods of harmonic analysis for geophysical problems,"The use of a Fourier series in expanding a function into a sum of trigonometric terms, and its application to the problem of resolving a daily variation into its harmonic components are discussed. Various practical methods adopted for the harmonic analysis of a daily variation are reviewed. A new form of analysis of a 12 ordinate scheme is suggested. This is both quicker and easier to handle than the earlier methods. It enables one to evaluate in about 5 minutes the first and the second harmonics from 12 bi-hourly values of a daily variation. Also, with the help of a supplementary chart, the higher harmonics can be evaluated without much extra labour.A similar method of harmonic analysis for a 24 ordinate scheme is suggested."

0,The Refined Analysis on the Convergence Behavior of Harmonic Map Sequence from Cylinders,"In this paper, we are concerned with the convergence behavior of a sequence of harmonic maps from long cylinders with uniformly bounded energy. If the bubbling phenomenon does not occur, we give the length formula of the limit map (i.e., geodesic in the target manifold). Furthermore, we provide a geometric explanation of the energy identity for a sequence of harmonic maps from degenerating Riemann surfaces with uniformly bounded energy, proved by M. Zhu."
0,Harmonic Analysis Invariants for Infinite Graphs Via Operators and Algorithms,"We present recent advances in harmonic analysis on infinite graphs. Our approach combines combinatorial tools with new results from the theory of unbounded Hermitian operators in Hilbert space, geometry, boundary constructions, and spectral invariants. We focus on particular classes of infinite graphs, including such weighted graphs which arise in electrical network models, as well as new diagrammatic graph representations. We further stress some direct parallels between our present analysis on infinite graphs, on the one hand, and, on the other, specific areas of potential theory, probability, harmonic functions, and boundary theory. The limit constructions, finite to infinite, and local to global, can be used in various applications."
0,Asymptotic Boundary Value Problem of Harmonic Maps via Harmonic Boundary,"We prove that given any continuous data f on the harmonic boundary of a complete Riemannian manifold with image within a ball in the normal range, there exists a harmonic map from the manifold into the ball taking the same boundary value at each harmonic boundary point as that of f."
0,On some classes of harmonic functions with nonnegative harmonic majorants in the half-plane,"Some ω-weighted classes of harmonic functions are introduced in the upper half-plane, the representations of these classes are found. A description of the boundary values of the functions from the considered classes is given by means of a notion of ω-capacity on the real axis, which becomes an analog of Frostman’s α-capacity in a particular case."
0,Computability in Harmonic Analysis,"We study the question of constructive approximation of the harmonic measure \(\omega _x^\varOmega \) of a bounded domain \(\varOmega \) with respect to a point \(x\in \varOmega \). In particular, using a new notion of computable harmonic approximation, we show that for an arbitrary such \(\varOmega \), computability of the harmonic measure \(\omega ^\varOmega _x\) for a single point \(x\in \varOmega \) implies computability of \(\omega _y^\varOmega \) for any  \(y\in \varOmega \). This may require a different algorithm for different points y, which leads us to the construction of surprising natural examples of continuous functions that arise as solutions to a Dirichlet problem, whose values can be computed at any point, but cannot be computed with the use of the same algorithm on all of their domains. We further study the conditions under which the harmonic measure is computable uniformly, that is by a single algorithm, and characterize them for regular domains with computable boundaries."
0,Harmonic analysis on symmetric Stein manifolds from the point of view of complex analysis,The classical theory of finite dimensional representations of compact and complex semisimple Lie groups is discussed from the perspective of multidimensional complex geometry and analysis.

Somewhat less complete results on theL 2 spectrum — in both the Mackey Machine and Orbit Method modes — are given for general semidirect product symmetric spaces."

This result is required in order to calculate the explicit decomposition of the oscillator representation wn for the dual pair G = SL(2, ℂ) × SO(n, ℂ) and to prove that every wn(G)-invariant Hilbert subspace of the space of tempered distributions decomposes multiplicity free."
0,Some Problems of Harmonic Analysis on Reductive Groups,An algebraic approach to harmonic analysis on reductive Lie groups is proposed. The case of complex semisimple Lie groups is considered in details. Some problems for real reductive Lie groups are discussed.
0,Limiting Weak-Type Behaviors for Certain Classical Operators in Harmonic Analysis,"This paper explores the limiting weak-type behaviors of certain classical operators in harmonic analysis including maximal operators, singular and fractional integral operators and maximal truncated singular integrals as well as the general convolution operators with weak-type Young’s inequalities. Some optimal limiting weak-type behaviors are given, which essentially improve and extend the previous results. As applications, several characterizations on the weak-type endpoint boundedness for fractional integral operators and maximal operators with homogeneous kernels, and the weak-type Young’s inequality for the general convolution operator are also obtained."
0,Harmonic analysis of stochastic equations and backward stochastic differential equations,"The BMO martingale theory is extensively used to study nonlinear multi-dimensional stochastic equations in \({\mathcal{R}^p}\) (\({p\in [1,\infty)}\)) and backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in \({\mathcal{R}^p\times \mathcal{H}^p}\) (\({p\in (1, \infty)}\)) and in \({\mathcal{R}^\infty\times\overline{L^\infty}^{\rm BMO}}\) , with the coefficients being allowed to be unbounded. In particular, the probabilistic version of Fefferman’s inequality plays a crucial role in the development of our theory, which seems to be new. Several new results are consequently obtained. The particular multi-dimensional linear cases for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and BSDEs are separately investigated, and the existence and uniqueness of a solution is connected to the property that the elementary solutions-matrix for the associated homogeneous SDE satisfies the reverse Hölder inequality for some suitable exponent p ≥ 1. Finally, some relations are established between Kazamaki’s quadratic critical exponent b(M) of a BMO martingale M and the spectral radius of the stochastic integral operator with respect to M, which lead to a characterization of Kazamaki’s quadratic critical exponent of BMO martingales being infinite."
0,"The convergence inL
1 of singular integrals in harmonic analysis and ergodic theory","We study the behavior of the ergodic singular integral τ associated to a nonsingular measurable flow {τ:t ∈ ℝ} on a finite measure space and a Calderón—Zygmund kernel with support in (0, ∞). We show that if the flow preserves the measure or, with more generality, if the flow is such that the semiflow {τt:t>-0} is Cesàrobounded,f and τf are integrable functions, then the truncations of the singular integral converge to τf not only in the a.e. sense but also in the L1-norm. To obtain this result we study the problem for the singular integrals in the real line and in the setting of the weighted L1-spaces."
0,Extended harmonic analysis of phase space representations for the Galilei group,"The spectral resolution of phase space representations of the Galilei group is achieved by deriving all possible decompositions into irreducible representations corresponding to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Spectral syntheses in terms of eigenfunction expansions, as well as in terms of continuous resolutions of the identity, are achieved. For the latter, the existence, uniqueness and other basic properties of resolution generators are established. This is shown to lead to systems of covariance related to measurements of stochastic phase space values performed with extended quantum test particles, whose proper wavefunctions are the aforementioned resolution generators."
0,Harmonic Analysis Associated with the Multivariate Laguerre Function,"In this paper, the generalized Laguerre hypergroup \(\mathbb {K}=[0,+\infty [^{n}\times \mathbb {R}\) is introduced via the multivariate Laguerre function. The inversion theorem, the Plancherel theorem and a Paley–Wiener-type theorem are established for the generalized Fourier–Laguerre transform."
0,Finite Element Analysis of an Optimal Control Problem in the Coefficients of Time-Harmonic Eddy Current Equations,"This paper is concerned with an optimal control problem governed by time-harmonic eddy current equations on a Lipschitz polyhedral domain. The controls are given by scalar functions entering in the coefficients of the curl-curl differential operator in the state equation. We present a mathematical analysis of the optimal control problem, including sensitivity analysis, regularity results, existence of an optimal control, and optimality conditions. Based on these results, we study the finite element analysis of the optimal control problem. Here, the state is discretized by the lowest order edge elements of Nédélec’s first family, and the control is discretized by continuous piecewise linear elements. Our main findings are convergence results of the finite element discretization (without a rate)."

0,Self-Similarity in Harmonic Analysis,"This is a survey of recent work involving concepts of self-similarity that relate to harmonic analysis. Perhaps the main theme is the question: how does the fractal or self-similar nature of an object express itself on the Fourier transform side? A wide range of related topics are discussed, including self-similar measures and distributions, fractal Plancherel theorems, Lp dimensions and densities of measures, multiperiodic functions and their asymptotic behavior, convolution equations with self-similar measures, self-similar tilings, and the development of self-similar analysis on stratified nilpotent Lie groups."
0,Harmonic analysis of additive Lévy processes,"Let X 1, . . . ,X  N  denote N independent d-dimensional Lévy processes, and consider the N-parameter random field $$\mathfrak{X}(t) := X_1(t_1)+\cdots+ X_N(t_N).$$First we demonstrate that for all nonrandom Borel sets \({F\subseteq{{\bf R}^d}}\) , the Minkowski sum \({\mathfrak{X}({{\bf R}^{N}_{+}})\oplus F}\) , of the range \({\mathfrak{X}({{\bf R}^{N}_{+}})}\) of \({\mathfrak{X}}\) with F, can have positive d-dimensional Lebesgue measure if and only if a certain capacity of F is positive. This improves our earlier joint effort with Yuquan Zhong by removing a certain condition of symmetry in Khoshnevisan et al. (Ann Probab 31(2):1097–1141, 2003). Moreover, we show that under mild regularity conditions, our necessary and sufficient condition can be recast in terms of one-potential densities. This rests on developing results in classical (non-probabilistic) harmonic analysis that might be of independent interest. As was shown in Khoshnevisan et al. (Ann Probab 31(2):1097–1141, 2003), the potential theory of the type studied here has a large number of consequences in the theory of Lévy processes. Presently, we highlight a few new consequences."
0,Harmonic analysis on tori,"We consider measurable subsets Ω∋{ofR}n with 0<m(Ω)<∞, and we assume that Ω has a spectral set Λ. (In the special case when Ω is also assumed open, Λ may be obtained as the joint spectrum of a family of commuting self-adjoint operators {H k: 1≤k≤n} in L 2 (Ω) such that each H k is an extension of i(∂/∂x k) on C c ∞(Ω), k=1, ..., n.)It is known that Ω is a fundamental domain for a lattice if Λ is itself a lattice. In this paper, we consider a class of examples where Λ is not assumed to be a lattice. Instead Λ is assumed to have a certain inhomogeneous form, and we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for Ω to be a fundamental domain for some lattice in {ofR}n. We are thus able to decide the question, ‘fundamental domain or not’, by considering only properties of the spectrum Λ. Our criterion is obtained as a corollary to a theorem concerning partitions of sets Ω which have a spectrum of inhomogeneous form."
0,Some Non-standard Biparametric Poincaré Type Inequalities Through Harmonic Analysis,We show some non-standard Poincaré type estimates in the biparametric setting with appropriate weights. We will derive these results using variants from classical estimates exploiting the interplay between maximal functions and fractional integrals. We also provide a sharper result by using extrapolation techniques.
0,"A unified approach to the topological centre 
problem for certain Banach algebras arising in abstract harmonic analysis","Let  \( \cal G \)  be a locally compact group. Consider the Banach algebra \( L_{1}(\cal G)^{**} \) , equipped with the first Arens multiplication, as well as the algebra LUC \( (\cal G)^* \)  , the dual of the space of bounded left uniformly continuous functions on  \( \cal G \)  , whose product extends the convolution in the measure algebra M \( (\cal G) \) . We present (for the most interesting case of a non-compact group) completely different - in particular, direct - proofs and even obtain  sharpened versions of the results, first proved by Lau-Losert in [9] and Lau in [8], that the topological centres of the latter algebras precisely are  \( L_{1}(\cal G) \)  and M \( (\cal G) \) , respectively. The special interest of our new approach lies in the fact that it shows a fairly general pattern of solving the topological centre problem for various kinds of Banach algebras; in particular, it avoids the use of any measure theoretical techniques. At the same time, deriving both results in perfect parallelity, our method reveals the nature of their close relation."
0,New matrix method for response analysis of circumferentially stiffened non-circular cylindrical shells under harmonic pressure,"Based on the governing equation of vibration of a kind of cylindrical shells written in a matrix differential equation of the first order, a new matrix method is presented for steady-state vibration analysis of a noncircular cylindrical shell simply supported at two ends and circumferentially stiffened by rings under harmonic pressure. Its difference from the existing works by Yamada and Irie is that the matrix differential equation is solved by using the extended homogeneous capacity precision integration approach other than the Runge-Kutta-Gill integration method. The transfer matrix can easily be determined by a high precision integration scheme. In addition, besides the normal interacting forces, which were commonly adopted by researchers earlier, the tangential interacting forces between the cylindrical shell and the rings are considered at the same time by means of the Dirac-δ function. The effects of the exciting frequencies on displacements and stresses responses have been investigated. Numerical results show that the proposed method is more efficient than the aforementioned method."
0,Analysis of biochemical phase shift oscillators by a harmonic balancing technique,"The use of harmonic balancing techniques for theoretically investigating a large class of biochemical phase shift oscillators is outlined and the accuracy of this approximate technique for large dimension nonlinear chemical systems is considered. It is concluded that for the equations under study these techniques can be successfully employed to both find periodic solutions and to indicate those cases which can not oscillate. The technique is a general one and it is possible to state a step by step procedure for its application. It has a substantial advantage in producing results which are immediately valid for arbitrary dimension. As the accuracy of the method increases with dimension, it complements classical small dimension methods.The results obtained by harmonic balancing analysis are compared with those obtained by studying the local stability properties of the singular points of the differential equation. A general theorem is derived which identifies those special cases where the results of first order harmonic balancing are identical to those of local stability analysis, and a necessary condition for this equivalence is derived. As a concrete example, the n-dimensional Goodwin oscillator is considered where ϱ, the Hill coefficient of the feedback metabolite, is equal to three and four. It is shown that for ϱ =3 or 4 and n≤4 the approximation indicates that it is impossible to construct a set of physically permissible reaction constants such that the system possesses a periodic solution. However for n≥5 it is always possible to find a large domain in the reaction constant space giving stable oscillations. A means of constructing such a parameter set is given. The results obtained here are compared with previously derived results for ϱ=1 and ϱ=2."

Fourier transforms, displacements in the GF(p ℓ)×GF(p ℓ) phase space and symplectic transforms of these functions are studied. It is shown that the formalism inherits many features from the theory of Galois fields. For example, Frobenius transformations and Galois groups are introduced in the present context. The relationship between harmonic analysis on GF(p ℓ) and harmonic analysis on its subfields, is studied."

We look for solutions \(f(\underline{x},x_{n})\) where the first variable is invariant under rotations. A special type of solution is generated by the so called spherical monogenic functions. These solutions may be characterize by a Vekua-type system and this system may be solved using Bessel functions. We will see that the solution of the equation \({\mathcal {M}}_\kappa f=0\) in this case will be a product of Bessel functions."

Since the p-adic Lizorkin spaces are invariant under these operators, they can play a key role in considerations related to fractional operator problems. Solutions of pseudo-differential equations are also constructed.

0,Some topics in the history of harmonic analysis in the twentieth century,"In December 2015 I gave a series of six lectures at the Indian Institute of Science in which I sketched the thematic development of some of the main techniques and results of 20th-century harmonic analysis. The subjects of the lectures were, briefly, as follows:   1. Fourier series, 1900-1950.   2. Singular integrals (part I).   3. Hp, BMO, and singular integrals (part II).   4. Littlewood-Paley theory: the history of a technique.   5. Harmonic analysis on groups.   6. Wavelets.   I emphasized interconnections, both the way in which the material in the first lecture provided the roots out of which most of the developments in the other lectures grew, and the ways in which those developments interacted with each other. I included sketches of as many proofs as the time would permit: some very brief, but some fairly complete, especially those whose methodology is an important part of the subject. Much was omitted, of course, and there was a natural bias toward the areas where I have spent periods of my own mathematical life. Many developments, particularly those of the final quarter-century, received at most a brief mention.This paper is a written account of these lectures with a few more details fleshed out, a few topics reorganized, and a few items added. I hope that others may find it an interesting narrative and a useful reference, and that it may lead some of them to share my enjoyment of exploring the original sources. I have tried to provide the references to those sources wherever possible, and for the more recent developments I also provide references to various expository works as the occasion arises. For the pre-1950 results discussed here and their proofs, however, there is one canonical reference, which I give here once and for all: Antoni Zygmund’s treatise [96]. (The more fundamental ones can also be found in Folland [29].)"

0,Harmonic analysis operators related to symmetrized Jacobi expansions for all admissible parameters,"This is an ultimate completion of our earlier paper [3] where mapping properties of several fundamental harmonic analysis operators in the setting of symmetrized Jacobi trigonometric expansions were investigated under certain restrictions on the underlying parameters of type. In the present article we take advantage of very recent results due to Nowak, Sjögren and Szarek to fully release those restrictions, and also to provide shorter and more transparent proofs of the previous restricted results. Moreover, we also study mapping properties of analogous operators in the parallel context of symmetrized Jacobi function expansions. Furthermore, as a consequence of our main results we conclude some new results related to the classical non-symmetrized Jacobi polynomial and function expansions."
0,Harmonic analysis of some classes of linear operators on a real Banach space,"For some classes of bounded linear operators acting in a real Banach space, the methods of abstract harmonic analysis are used to obtain conditions for these operators to be decomposable in the sense of Foiaş and the conditions for the existence of a nontrivial invariant subspace."
0,Subgaussian estimates in probability and harmonic analysis,We will discuss subgaussian estimates in harmonic analysis involving the non-tangential maximal function \(N_{\alpha }f\) and the area function \(A_{\beta } f\) of a function f on \({\mathbb {R}}^n.\) We will first introduce subgaussian estimates in the setting of martingales; these then lead to analogous estimates for harmonic functions. Among the consequences of these are sharp \(L^p\) inequalities \(\Vert N_{\alpha }f\Vert _p \le C_p \Vert A_{\beta }f\Vert _p\); here \(C_p= O(\sqrt{p})\) as \(p \rightarrow \infty \) and this order is sharp. The subgaussian estimates produce Laws of the Iterated Logarithm (LILs) involving the non-tangential maximal function and area function. These ideas are also applied to lacunary series of more general functions to yield LILs.
0,Optimal mean squared error analysis of the harmonic gradient estimators,This paper presents a mean squared error analysis of the harmonic gradient estimators for steady-state discrete-event simulation outputs. Optimal mean squared errors for the harmonic gradient estimators are shown to converge to zero as the simulation run length approaches infinity at the same rate as the optimal mean squared errors for the symmetric (two-sided) finite-difference gradient estimator. Implications of this result are discussed.
0,"Harmonic analysis on SL(2,ℂ) and projectively adapted pattern representation) and projectively adapted pattern representation","Among all image transforms, the classical (Euclidean) Fourier transform has had the widest range of applications in image processing. Here its projective analogue, given by the double cover groupSL(2, ℂ) of the projective groupPSL(2, ℂ) for patterns, is developed. First, a projectively invariant classification of patterns is constructed in terms of orbits of the groupPSL(2, ℂ) acting on the image plane (with complex coordinates) by linear-fractional transformations. Then,SL(2, ℂ)-harmonic analysis, in the noncompact picture of induced representations, is used to decompose patterns into the components invariant under irreducible representations of the principal series ofSL(2, ℂ). Usefulness in digital image processing problems is studied by providing a camera model in which the action ofSL(2, ℂ) on the complex image plane corresponds to, and exhausts, planar central projections as produced when aerial images of the same scene are taken from different vantage points. The projectively adapted properties of theSL(2, ℂ)-harmonic analysis, as applied to the problems, in image processing, are confirmed by computational tests. Therefore, it should be an important step in developing a system for automated perspective-independent object recognition."
0,Harmonic analysis on compact commutative hypergroups: The role of the maximum subgroup,"The article is written in two parts: Part I develops basic results within a new axiomatic development introduced by one of the authors in a previous work. It allows for a larger category of measure algebras to be included than did the former axioms (DJS-hypergroups). While new and independent proofs are given, this part of the article is expository.Part II is the core of the paper: its focus is the study of the spectral properties of compact commutative hypergroup measure algebras. These share commonL 1 andL 2 theories; but the spectra of the measure algebras are much more diverse, and we pursue a classification based on the maximal ideal spaces of these algebras. Important features depend on the existence and structure of a non-trivial maximum subgroup. We investigate symmetry, idempotents, and Sidon sets with respect to these considerations. The results generalize earlier studies of K. Ross, Y. Kanjin, and the authors.In the context of theL 1 theory, we use Dixmier's symbolic calculus to construct special approximate identities. Concrete examples are provided. The two parts may be read independently of each other, but the whole paper is self-contained."
0,Harmonic Analysis on the SU(2) Dynamical Quantum Group,"Dynamical quantum groups were recently introduced by Etingof and Varchenko as an algebraic framework for studying the dynamical Yang–Baxter equation, which is precisely the Yang–Baxter equation satisfied by 6j-symbols. We investigate one of the simplest examples, generalizing the standard SU(2) quantum group. The matrix elements for its corepresentations are identified with Askey–Wilson polynomials, and the Haar measure with the Askey–Wilson measure. The discrete orthogonality of the matrix elements yield the orthogonality of q-Racah polynomials (or quantum 6j-symbols). The Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for representations and corepresentations are also identified with q-Racah polynomials. This results in new algebraic proofs of the Biedenharn–Elliott identity satisfied by quantum 6j-symbols."

The computation speeds obtained on computers with 32-bit and 64-bit processors are compared. It is shown that the use of all mentioned possibilities and the Intel Itanium 2 processor provides from to threefold to tenfold total saving of time, depending on the operating system and the computer type. Parallelization of the algorithm for different operating systems in combination with the use of a library adapted to the processor can increase the program’s execution speed by a factor of 1.5–3."
0,On Primitives and Conjugate Harmonic Pairs in Hermitian Clifford Analysis,"The notion of a conjugate harmonic pair in the context of Hermitian Clifford analysis is introduced as a pair of specific harmonic functions summing up to a Hermitian monogenic function in an open region \(\Omega \) of \(\mathbb C ^n\). Hermitian monogenic functions are special monogenic functions, which are at the core of so-called Clifford analyis, a straightforward generalization to higher dimension of the holomorphic functions in the complex plane. Under certain geometric conditions on \(\Omega \) the conjugate harmonic to a given specific harmonic is explicitly constructed and the potential or primitive of a Hermitian monogenic function is determined."
0,Harmonic analysis on the Iwahori–Hecke algebra,"These are purely expository notes of Opdam’s analysis [O1] of the trace form τ(f) = f(e) on the Hecke algebra H = C  c (I\G/I) of compactly supported functions f on a connected reductive split p-adic group G which are biinvariant under an Iwahori subgroup I, extending Macdonald’s work. We attempt to give details of the proofs, and choose notations which seem to us more standard. Many objects of harmonic analysis are met: principal series, Macdonald’s spherical forms, trace forms, Bernstein forms. The latter were introduced by Opdam under the name Eisenstein series for H. The idea of the proof is that the last two linear forms are proportional, and the proportionality constant is computed by projection to Macdonald’s spherical forms. Crucial use is made of Bernstein’s presentation of the Iwahori–Hecke algebra by means of generators and relations, as an extension of a finite dimensional algebra by a large commutative subalgebra. We give a complete proof of this using the universal unramified principal series right H-module M = C  c (A(O)N\G/I) to develop a theory of intertwining operators algebraically."
0,Spectral Decomposition of Cyclic Operators in Discrete Harmonic Analysis,"For the operators of the discrete Fourier transform, the discrete Vilenkin–Christenson transform, and all linear transpositions of the discrete Walsh transform, we obtain their spectral decompositions and calculate the dimensions of eigenspaces. For complex operators, namely, the discrete Fourier transform and the Vilenkin–Christenson transform, we obtain real projectors on eigenspaces. For the discrete Walsh transform, we consider in detail the Paley and Walsh orderings and a new ordering in which the matrices of operators are symmetric. For operators of linear transpositions of the discrete Walsh transforms with nonsymmetric matrices, we obtain a spectral decomposition with complex projectors on eigenspaces. We also present the Parseval frame for eigenspaces of the discrete Walsh transform."

A reformulation of this result in terms of a Hadwiger-type theorem for continuous translation-invariant and SO(n)-equivariant tensor valuations is also given. As an application, symmetry properties of rigid-motion invariant and homogeneous bivaluations are established and then used to prove new inequalities of Brunn–Minkowski type for convex body valued valuations."

On a uniform rectangular prism mesh, superclose property is achieved for electric field E and magnetic filed H with the boundary condition E×n=0 by means of the asymptotic expansion. Applying postprocessing operators, a superconvergence result is stated for the discretization error of the postprocessed discrete solution to the solution itself. To our best knowledge, this is the first global superconvergence analysis of nonconforming mixed finite elements for the Maxwell’s equations. Furthermore, the approximation accuracy will be improved by extrapolation method."

We establish weighted ℓp-boundedness properties of maximal operators and Littlewood-Paley g-functions defined by Poisson and heat semigroups generated by the difference operator $$ {\Delta}_{\lambda} f(n):=a_{n}^{\lambda} f(n+1)-2f(n)+a_{n-1}^{\lambda} f(n-1),\quad n\in \mathbb{N}, \lambda >0, $$where \(a_{n}^{\lambda } :=\{(2\lambda +n)(n+1)/[(n+\lambda )(n+1+\lambda )]\}^{1/2}\), \(n\in \mathbb {N}\), and \(a_{-1}^{\lambda }:=0\). We also prove weighted ℓp-boundedness properties of transplantation operators associated with the system \(\{\varphi _{n}^{\lambda } \}_{n\in \mathbb {N}}\) of ultraspherical functions, a family of eigenfunctions of Δλ. In order to show our results we previously establish a vector-valued local Calderón-Zygmund theorem in our discrete setting."
0,Mathematical problems of stochastic quantum mechanics: Harmonic analysis on phase space and quantum geometry,"In this paper we review the mathematical methods and problems that are specific to the programme of stochastic quantum mechanics and quantum spacetime. The physical origin of these problems is explained, and then the mathematical models are developed. Three notions emerge as central to the programme: positive operator-valued (POV) measures on a Hilbert space, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and fibre bundle formulations of quantum geometries. A close connection between the first two notions is shown to exist, which provides a natural setting for introducing a fibration on the associated overcomplete family of vectors. The introduction of group covariance leads to an extended version of harmonic analysis on phase space. It also yields a theory of induced group representations, which extends the results of Mackey on imprimitivity systems for locally compact groups to the more general case of systems of covariance. Quantum geometries emerge as fibre bundles whose base spaces are manifolds of mean stochastic locations for quantum test particles (i.e., spacetime excitons) that display a phase space structure, and whose fibres and structure groups contain, respectively, the aforementioned overcomplete families of vectors and unitary group representations of phase space systems of covariance."

0,Harmonic analysis and asymptotic behavior of solutions to the abstract cauchy problem,"LetC ub (\(\mathbb{J}\), X) denote the Banach space of all uniformly continuous bounded functions defined on\(\mathbb{J}\)2 ε {ℝ+, ℝ} with values in a Banach spaceX. Let ℱ be a class fromC ub(\(\mathbb{J}\),X). We introduce a spectrumspℱ(φ) of a functionφ εC ub (ℝ,X) with respect to ℱ. This notion of spectrum enables us to investigate all twice differentiable bounded uniformly continuous solutions on ℝ to the abstract Cauchy problem (*)ω′(t) =Aω(t) +φ(t),φ(0) =x,φ ε ℱ, whereA is the generator of aC 0-semigroupT(t) of bounded operators. Ifφ = 0 andσ(A) ∩iℝ is countable, all bounded uniformly continuous mild solutions on ℝ+ to (*) are studied. We prove the bound-edness and uniform continuity of all mild solutions on ℝ+ in the cases (i)T(t) is a uniformly exponentially stableC 0-semigroup andφ εC ub(ℝ,X); (ii)T(t) is a uniformly bounded analyticC 0-semigroup,φ εC ub (ℝ,X) andσ(A) ∩i sp(φ) = Ø. Under the condition (i) if the restriction ofφ to ℝ+ belongs to ℱ = ℱ(ℝ+,X), then the solutions belong to ℱ. In case (ii) if the restriction ofφ to ℝ+ belongs to ℱ = ℱ(ℝ+,X), andT(t) is almost periodic, then the solutions belong to ℱ. The existence of mild solutions on ℝ to (*) is also discussed."
0,Harmonic Analysis of Finite Lamplighter Random Walks,"Recently, several papers have been devoted to the analysis of lamplighter random walks, in particular, in the case where the underlying graph is the infinite path \( \mathbb{Z} \). In the present paper, we develop a spectral analysis for lamplighter random walks on finite graphs. In the general case, we use the C 2-symmetry to reduce the spectral computations to a series of eigenvalue problems on the underlying graph. If the graph has a transitive isometry group G, we also describe the spectral analysis in terms of the representation theory of the wreath product C 2≀G. We apply our theory to the lamplighter random walks on the complete graph and on the discrete circle. These examples have already been studied by Häggström and Jonasson by probabilistic methods."

We first discuss the absolute continuity of the quasi-norm and its normality, then prove the boundedness of several maximal operators. We also establish a kind of Marcinkiewicz-type interpolation theorem between weak Orlicz spaces. As applications, the weak type analogues of several classical inequalities in harmonic analysis is obtained."
0,Harmonic analysis on the infinite symmetric group,"The infinite symmetric group S(∞), whose elements are finite permutations of {1,2,3,...}, is a model example of a “big” group. By virtue of an old result of Murray–von Neumann, the one–sided regular representation of S(∞) in the Hilbert space ℓ2(S(∞)) generates a type II1 von Neumann factor while the two–sided regular representation is irreducible. This shows that the conventional scheme of harmonic analysis is not applicable to S(∞): for the former representation, decomposition into irreducibles is highly non–unique, and for the latter representation, there is no need of any decomposition at all. We start with constructing a compactification \(\mathfrak{S}\supset{S(\infty)}\), which we call the space of virtual permutations. Although \(\mathfrak{S}\) is no longer a group, it still admits a natural two–sided action of S(∞). Thus, \(\mathfrak{S}\) is a G–space, where G stands for the product of two copies of S(∞). On \(\mathfrak{S}\), there exists a unique G-invariant probability measure μ1, which has to be viewed as a “true” Haar measure for S(∞). More generally, we include μ1 into a family {μ t : t>0} of distinguished G-quasiinvariant probability measures on virtual permutations. By making use of these measures, we construct a family {T z : z∈ℂ} of unitary representations of G, called generalized regular representations (each representation T z  with z≠=0 can be realized in the Hilbert space \(L^2(\mathfrak{S}, \mu_t)\), where t=|z|2). As |z|→∞, the generalized regular representations T z  approach, in a suitable sense, the “naive” two–sided regular representation of the group G in the space ℓ2(S(∞)). In contrast with the latter representation, the generalized regular representations T z  are highly reducible and have a rich structure. We prove that any T z  admits a (unique) decomposition into a multiplicity free continuous integral of irreducible representations of G. For any two distinct (and not conjugate) complex numbers z1, z2, the spectral types of the representations \(T_{z_1}\) and \(T_{z_2}\) are shown to be disjoint. In the case z∈ℤ, a complete description of the spectral type is obtained. Further work on the case z∈ℂ∖ℤ reveals a remarkable link with stochastic point processes and random matrix theory. "

These diffusion equations model the probability distribution of the orientation in space of certain polymers in solution, including DNA. We study the evolution equations satisfied by the Fourier coefficients of such a solution. Our main task here is to estimate these Fourier coefficients sufficiently well that one canestimate the error in truncating the group inverse Fourier transform to afinite region."
0,Complex response analysis of a non-smooth oscillator under harmonic and random excitations,"It is well-known that practical vibro-impact systems are often influenced by random perturbations and external excitation forces, making it challenging to carry out the research of this category of complex systems with non-smooth characteristics. To address this problem, by adequately utilizing the stochastic response analysis approach and performing the stochastic response for the considered non-smooth system with the external excitation force and white noise excitation, a modified conducting process has proposed. Taking the multiple nonlinear parameters, the non-smooth parameters, and the external excitation frequency into consideration, the steady-state stochastic P-bifurcation phenomena of an elastic impact oscillator are discussed. It can be found that the system parameters can make the system stability topology change. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified and demonstrated by the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Consequently, the conclusions show that the process can be applied to stochastic non-autonomous and non-smooth systems."

0,Harmonic analysis of fractal measures,"We consider affine systems inR n constructed from a given integral invertible and expansive matrixR, and a finite setB of translates,σ bx:=R–1x+b; the corresponding measure μ onR n is a probability measure fixed by the self-similarity\(\mu = \left| B \right|^{ - 1} \sum\nolimits_{b \in B} {\mu o\sigma _b^{ - 1} } \). There are twoa priori candidates for an associated orthogonal harmonic analysis: (i) the existence of some subset Λ inR n such that the exponentials {eiλ·x}Λ form anorthogonal basis forL 2(μ); and (ii) the existence of a certaindual pair of representations of theC *-algebraO N wheren is the cardinality of the setB. (For eachN, theC *-algebraO N is known to be simple; it is also called the Cuntz algebra.) We show that, in the “typical” fractal case, the naive version (i) must be rejected; typically the orthogonal exponentials inL 2(μ) fail to span a dense subspace. Instead we show that theC *-algebraic version of an orthogonal harmonic analysis, namely (ii), is a natural substitute. It turns out that this version is still based on exponentialse iλ·x, but in a more indirect way. (See details in Section 5 below.) Our main result concerns the intrinsic geometric features of affine systems, based onR andB, such that μ has theC *-algebra property (ii). Specifically, we show that μ has an orthogonal harmonic analysis (in the sense (ii)) if the system (R, B) satisfies some specific symmetry conditions (which are geometric in nature). Our conditions for (ii) are stated in terms of two pieces of data: (a) aunitary generalized Hadamard matrix, and (b) a certainsystem of lattices which must exist and, at the same time, be compatible with the Hadamard matrix. A partial converse to this result is also given. Several examples are calculated, and a new maximality condition for exponentials is identified."
0,Harmonic analysis and Boolean function complexity,"Any attempt to find connections between mathematical properties of functions and their computational complexity has strong relevance to theory of computation. Indeed, there is the hope that developing new mathematical techniques could lead to discovering properties that might be responsible for lower bounds. The current situation is that none of the known techniques has yet led to lower bounds in general models of computation.The subject of this paper is related to the above general arguments. More precisely, we study the Fourier Transform of Boolean functions, and analyze the extent to which mathematical techniques from the area of  abstract harmonic analysis can provide some insight in our current understanding of Boolean circuit complexity. In addition to presenting new applications of Fourier analysis to circuit complexity, we give the necessary background on abstract harmonic analysis and review some work on the subject."
0,Problems of almost everywhere convergence related to harmonic analysis and number theory,"The object of this paper is to discuss certain methods for studying almost everywhere convergence problems. We consider the generalization of the Riesz-Raikov theorem where the dilation numberϑ>1 is not necessarily an integer. It is known (see [B2]) that the averages (1/N)Σ N1  f(ϑ n x) converge a.e. to ∝ 10  fdx wheneverϑ is algebraic andf a 1-periodic function onR satisfying ∝ 10 |f(x)|2 dx<∞. Here the particular case of rational dilation is treated. The reader is referred to [B2] for the general (algebraic) case.The following definitive relation between a.e. convergence and algebraic numbers is proved. Let {μ j} be the sequence of measures\(\mu _j = \mathop * \limits_{k = 1}^j \left( {\frac{1}{2}\delta _{ - \xi } + \frac{1}{2}\delta _\xi k} \right), \xi = \theta ^{ - 1} \) converging weak* to the natural measureμ on the Cantor set of dissection ratioϑ. Thenf*μ j→f*μ a.e. for allL ∞ (T) functions iffϑ is algebraic. This fact depends on [B3] and a variant of Rota’s theorem [Ro] on a.e. convergence of certain compositions of operators. Further applications of this result in ergodic theory are presented in the last section of the paper. In section 4, a.e. convergence of Riemann sums of periodicL 2-functions is investigated. It is shown that almost surelyR n f has a logarithmic density, where\(R_n f\left( x \right) = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_0^{n - 1} {f\left( {x + \frac{j}{n}} \right)} \). This result complements the work of R. Salem on the subject."

0,Estimates for maximal functions associated with hypersurfaces in ℝ3 and related problems of harmonic analysis,"We study the boundedness problem for maximal operators \( \mathcal{M} \) associated with averages along smooth hypersurfaces S of finite type in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. For p > 2, we prove that if no affine tangent plane to S passes through the origin and S is analytic, then the associated maximal operator is bounded on \( {L^p}\left( {{\mathbb{R}^3}} \right) \) if and only if p > h(S), where h(S) denotes the so-called height of the surface S (defined in terms of certain Newton diagrams). For non-analytic S we obtain the same statement with the exception of the exponent p = h(S). Our notion of height h(S) is closely related to A. N. Varchenko’s notion of height h(ϕ) for functions ϕ such that S can be locally represented as the graph of ϕ after a rotation of coordinates.Several consequences of this result are discussed. In particular we verify a conjecture by E. M. Stein and its generalization by A. Iosevich and E. Sawyer on the connection between the decay rate of the Fourier transform of the surface measure on S and the L p-boundedness of the associated maximal operator \( \mathcal{M} \), and a conjecture by Iosevich and Sawyer which relates the L p-boundedness of \( \mathcal{M} \) to an integrability condition on S for the distance to tangential hyperplanes, in dimension 3.In particular, we also give essentially sharp uniform estimates for the Fourier transform of the surface measure on S, thus extending a result by V. N. Karpushkin from the analytic to the smooth setting and implicitly verifying a conjecture by V. I. Arnold in our context. As an immediate application of this, we obtain an \( {L^p}\left( {{\mathbb{R}^3}} \right) - {L^2}(S) \) Fourier restriction theorem for S."

There is a commutative algebra  spanned by averaging operators A λ , λ ∈ P+, acting on the space of all functions f:V P →, where V P  is in most cases the set of all special vertices of , and P+ is a set of dominant coweights of R. This algebra is studied in [6] and [7] for Ã n  buildings, and the general case is treated in [15].In this paper we show that all algebra homomorphisms h: may be expressed in terms of the Macdonald spherical functions. We also provide a second formula for these homomorphisms in terms of an integral over the boundary of .

0,Harmonic analysis in infinite dimension,We study the Hermite transform onL 2(μ) where μ is a Gaussian measure on a Lusin locally convex spaceE. We are then lead to a Hilbert space (ℋ) of analytic functions onE which is also a natural range for the Laplace transform. LetB be a convenient Hilbert-Schmidt operator on the Cameron-Martin spaceH of μ. There exists a natural sequence Cap n  of capacities onE associated toB. This implies the Kondratev-Yokoi theorem about positive linear forms on the Hida test-functions space.
0,Harmonic analysis on solvable extensions of H-type groups,"To each groupN of Heisenberg type one can associate a generalized Siegel domain, which for specialN is a symmetric space. This domain can be viewed as a solvable extensionS =NA ofN endowed with a natural left-invariant Riemannian metric. We prove that the functions onS that depend only on the distance from the identity form a commutative convolution algebra. This makesS an example of a harmonic manifold, not necessarily symmetric. In order to study this convolution algebra, we introduce the notion of “averaging projector” and of the corresponding spherical functions in a more general context. We finally determine the spherical functions for the groupsS and their Martin boundary."
0,Remarks on ‘Norm Estimates of the Partial Derivatives for Harmonic Mappings and Harmonic Quasiregular Mappings’,"Let \(f = P[F]\) denote the Poisson integral of F in the unit disk \({\mathbb {D}}\) with F being absolutely continuous in the unit circle \({\mathbb {T}}\) and \({\dot{F}}\in L^{p}({\mathbb {T}})\), where \({\dot{F}}(e^{it})=\frac{d}{dt} F(e^{it})\) and \(p\ge 1\). Recently, the author in Zhu (J Geom Anal, 2020) proved that (1) if f is a harmonic mapping and \(1\le p< 2\), then \(f_{z}\) and \(\overline{f_{{\overline{z}}}}\in \mathcal {B}^{p}({\mathbb {D}}),\) the classical Bergman spaces of \({\mathbb {D}}\) [12, Theorem 1.2]; (2) if f is a harmonic quasiregular mapping and \(1\le p\le \infty \), then \(f_{z},\) \(\overline{f_{{\overline{z}}}}\in \mathcal {H}^{p}({\mathbb {D}}),\) the classical Hardy spaces of \({\mathbb {D}}\) [12, Theorem 1.3]. These are the main results in Zhu (J Geom Anal, 2020). The purpose of this paper is to generalize these two results. First, we prove that, under the same assumptions, [12, Theorem 1.2] is true when \(1\le p< \infty \). Also, we show that [12, Theorem 1.2] is not true when \(p=\infty \). Second, we demonstrate that [12, Theorem 1.3] still holds true when the assumption f being a harmonic quasiregular mapping is replaced by the weaker one f being a harmonic elliptic mapping."
0,Asymptotic analysis for Dirac-harmonic maps from degenerating spin surfaces and with bounded index,"We study the refined blow-up behaviour of a sequence of Dirac-harmonic maps from degenerating spin surfaces with uniformly bounded energy in the case that the domain surfaces converge to a spin surface with only Neveu–Schwarz type nodes. For Dirac-harmonic necks appearing near the nodes, we show that the limit of the map part of each neck is a geodesic in the target manifold. Moreover, we give a length formula for the limit geodesics appearing near the node in terms of the Pohozaev type constants associated to the sequence. In particular, if the Ricci curvature of the target manifold has a positive lower bound and the Dirac-harmonic sequence has bounded index, then the limit of the map part of the necks consist of geodesics of finite length and the energy identities hold.

0,Bubbling analysis for approximate Lorentzian harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces,"For a sequence of approximate harmonic maps \((u_n,v_n)\) (meaning that they satisfy the harmonic system up to controlled error terms) from a compact Riemann surface with smooth boundary to a standard static Lorentzian manifold with bounded energy, we prove that identities for the Lorentzian energy hold during the blow-up process. In particular, in the special case where the Lorentzian target metric is of the form \(g_N -\beta dt^2\) for some Riemannian metric \(g_N\) and some positive function \(\beta \) on N, we prove that such identities also hold for the positive energy (obtained by changing the sign of the negative part of the Lorentzian energy) and there is no neck between the limit map and the bubbles. As an application, we complete the blow-up picture of singularities for a harmonic map flow into a standard static Lorentzian manifold. We prove that the energy identities of the flow hold at both finite and infinite singular times. Moreover, the no neck property of the flow at infinite singular time is true."
0,Harmonic Analysis Associated with the One-Dimensional Dunkl Transform,"This paper presents a systematic study for harmonic analysis associated with the one-dimensional Dunkl transform, which is based upon the generalized Cauchy–Riemann equations D  x  u−∂  y  v=0,∂  y  u+D  x  v=0, where D  x  is the Dunkl operator (D  x  f)(x)=f′(x)+(λ/x)(f(x)−f(−x)). Various properties about the λ-subharmonic function, the λ-Poisson integral, the conjugate λ-Poisson integral, and the associated maximal functions are obtained, and the λ-Hilbert transform , a crucial analog to the classical one, is introduced and studied by a stringent method. The theory of the associated Hardy spaces \(H_{\lambda}^{p}({\mathbb{R}}^{2}_{+})\) on the half-plane \({\mathbb{R}}^{2}_{+}\) for p≥p 0=2λ/(2λ+1) with λ>0 extends the results of Muckenhoupt and Stein about the Hankel transform to a general case and contains a number of further results. In particular, the λ-Hilbert transform  is shown to be a bounded mapping from \(H_{\lambda}^{1}({\mathbb{R}})\) to \(L^{1}_{\lambda}({\mathbb{R}})\); and associated to the Dunkl transform, an analog of the well-known Hardy inequality is proved for \(f\in H^{1}_{\lambda}({\mathbb{R}})\)."
0,"From Harmonic Maps to the Nonlinear Supersymmetric Sigma Model of Quantum Field Theory: at the Interface of Theoretical Physics, Riemannian Geometry, and Nonlinear Analysis","Harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces arise from a conformally invariant variational problem. Therefore, on one hand, they are intimately connected with moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, and on the other hand, because the conformal group is noncompact, constitute a prototype for the formation of singularities, the so-called bubbles, in geometric analysis. In theoretical physics, they arise from the nonlinear \(\sigma \)-model of quantum field theory. That model possesses a supersymmetric extension, coupling a harmonic map like field with a nonlinear spinor field. In the physical model, that spinor field is anticommuting. In this contribution, we analyze both a mathematical version with a commuting spinor field and the original supersymmetric version. Moreover, this model gives rise to a further field, a gravitino, that can be seen as the supersymmetric partner of a Riemann surface metric. Altogether, this leads to a beautiful combination of concepts from quantum field theory, structures from Riemannian geometry and Riemann surface theory, and methods of nonlinear geometric analysis."

0,Computational Bounds for Doing Harmonic Analysis on Permutation Modules of Finite Groups,"We develop an approach to finding upper bounds for the number of arithmetic operations necessary for doing harmonic analysis on permutation modules of finite groups. The approach takes advantage of the intrinsic orbital structure of permutation modules, and it uses the multiplicities of irreducible submodules within individual orbital spaces to express the resulting computational bounds. We conclude by showing that these bounds are surprisingly small when dealing with certain permutation modules arising from the action of the symmetric group on tabloids."
0,Higher-order neck analysis of harmonic maps and its applications,"In this paper, we prove some refined estimate in the neck region when a sequence of harmonic maps from surfaces blow up. The new estimate puts more restrictions to the bubble and the weak limit map than the touching required by the classical no-neck theorem. As an application, we prove an inequality about the nullity and index when blow-up occurs."
0,Generalized neck analysis of harmonic maps from surfaces,"In this paper, we study the behavior of a sequence of harmonic maps from surfaces with uniformly bounded energy on the generalized neck domain.

An upper bound of the energy density is proved and we use it to study the limit of the nullity and index of the sequence. "
0,Comparing Harmonic and Inframonogenic Functions in Clifford Analysis,"Harmonic functions are the solutions of the second-order partial differential equation \(\partial _{\underline{x}}\partial _{\underline{x}}u=0\), where \(\partial _{\underline{x}}\) stands for the Dirac operator factorizing the Laplacian in \({{\mathbb {R}}}^m\). In this paper, we consider functions satisfying the sandwich equation \(\partial _{\underline{x}}u\partial _{\underline{x}}=0\), the so-called inframonogenic functions. It is easily seen that the real-valued solutions of both previous equations will be identical. However, the situation is quite different when Clifford algebra valued solutions are considered. This leads to different classes of functions, which appear together in some topics of linear elasticity theory. The main purpose of this paper is to deepen the understanding of inframonogenic functions as well as to contrast its behavior with the more traditional harmonic functions."

For \(p > \frac{n}{2}\), we prove Hölder continuity for weak solution s which satisfy a certain smallness condition.

0,"Harmonic mean curvature lines on
surfaces immersed in 
\( \mathbb{R}^{3} \)
","Consider oriented surfaces immersed in  \( \mathbb{R}^{3} \). Associated to them, here are studied pairs of transversal foliations with singularities, defined on the Elliptic region, where the Gaussian curvature \( {\cal K} \), given by the product of the principal curvatures k 1, k 2 is positive. The leaves of the foliations are the lines of harmonic mean curvature, also called characteristic or diagonal lines, along which the normal curvature of the immersion is given by \( {\cal K}/{\cal H} \), where \( {\cal H} = {\left( {k_{1} + k_{2} } \right)}/2 \) is the arithmetic mean curvature. That is, \( {cal K}/{\cal H} = {\left( {{\left( {1/k_{1} + 1/k_{2} } \right)}/2} \right)}^{{ - 1}} \) is the harmonic mean of the principal curvatures k 1, k 2 of the immersion. The singularities of the foliations are the umbilic points and parabolic curves, where k 1 = k 2 and \( {\cal K} = 0 \), respectively.Here are determined the structurally stable patterns of harmonic mean curvature lines near the umbilic points, parabolic curves and harmonic mean curvature cycles, the periodic leaves of the foliations. The genericity of these patterns is established.This provides the three essential local ingredients to establish sufficient conditions, likely to be also necessary, for Harmonic Mean Curvature Structural Stability of immersed surfaces. This study, outlined towards the end of the paper, is a natural analog and complement for that carried out previously by the authors for the Arithmetic Mean Curvature and the Asymptotic Structural Stability of immersed surfaces, [13, 14, 17], and also extended recently to the case of the Geometric Mean Curvature Configuration [15]."
0,Axially Harmonic Functions and the Harmonic Functional Calculus on the S-spectrum,"The spectral theory on the S-spectrum was introduced to give an appropriate mathematical setting to quaternionic quantum mechanics, but it was soon realized that there were different applications of this theory, for example, to fractional heat diffusion and to the spectral theory for the Dirac operator on manifolds. In this seminal paper we introduce the harmonic functional calculus based on the S-spectrum and on an integral representation of axially harmonic functions. This calculus can be seen as a bridge between harmonic analysis and the spectral theory. The resolvent operator of the harmonic functional calculus is the commutative version of the pseudo S-resolvent operator. This new calculus also appears, in a natural way, in the product rule for the F-functional calculus."

In particular, it has been obtained the description of the domains Ω ⊂ ℂ, where the restoration of the analytic continuation of an analytic element with fixed center a ∈ Ω is possible by universal (independent from an element) one step matrix summation methods. The aim of this paper is the solution of the analog problem on description of the domains Ω ⊂ ℝn, n ≥ 2, where the restoration of the harmonic continuation of harmonic elements (the series of homogeneous harmonic polynomials — the Laplace series converging in a ball in ℝn with fixed center) is possible bymeans of universal semicontinuousmatrix summation methods."

This allows to approximate functions with p-harmonic functions in the same way as the classical harmonic approximation lemma (going back to De Giorgi) does via harmonic functions. Finally, we show how to combine this tool with suitable regularity estimates for solutions to degenerate elliptic systems with a critical growth right hand side, in order to obtain partial \(C^{1,\alpha}\)-regularity of p-harmonic maps."

0,Operator adapted spectral element methods I: harmonic and generalized harmonic polynomials," The paper presents results on the approximation of functions which solve an elliptic differential equation by operator adapted systems of functions. Compared with standard polynomials, these operator adapted systems have superior local approximation properties. First, the case of Laplace's equation and harmonic polynomials as operator adapted functions is analyzed and rates of convergence in a Sobolev space setting are given for the approximation with harmonic polynomials. Special attention is paid to the approximation of singular functions that arise typically in corners. These results for harmonic polynomials are extended to general elliptic equations with analytic coefficients by means of the theory of Bergman and Vekua; the approximation results for Laplace's equation hold true verbatim, if harmonic polynomials are replaced with generalized harmonic polynomials. The Partition of Unity Method is used in a numerical example to construct an operator adapted spectral method for Laplace's equation that is based on approximating with harmonic polynomials locally."
0,Conjugate Harmonic Functions in Euclidean Space: a Spherical Approach,"Given a harmonic function U in a domain Ω in Euclidean space, the problem of finding a harmonic conjugate V, generalizing the well-known case of the complex plane, was considered in [4] in the framework of Clifford analysis. By the nature of the given construction, which is genuinely cartesian, this approach lead to geometric constraints on the domain Ω. In this paper we consider the problem in a larger class of domains, by a spherical approach. Starting from a real-valued function u, and singling out the radial direction, we explicitly construct a harmonic function of the form w = e r v, with v ∈ span(e θ 1,…, e θ  m−1), such that u+w is monogenic, i.e. a null solution of the Dirac operator. As an illustration, the construction is applied to important classes of homogeneous monogenic polynomials and functions. Finally, it is investigated to which extent the approach also applies to the complex plane case."

Namely, we get analogues of these results in n-dimensional Euclidean space in terms of p-harmonic radius. The proofs are based on the technique of moduli of curve families and dissymmetrization of such families."

0,Preconditioned iterative solver on the coarsest level of a multi-grid method for high frequency time harmonic electromagnetic field analyses,"A multi-grid method is one of the most powerful linear solvers for finite element electromagnetic field analysis. However, as the discretized model has recently been enlarged, a solution process for a linear system arising on the coarsest level tends to be problematic in a complete multi-grid solution process. Whereas a linear system on the coarsest level is generally solved by a direct solver, we solve it here by means of an iterative solver to reduce the memory requirements. Since a conventional preconditioning technique is not effective for such a linear system, we introduce preconditioning techniques based on Arnold, Falk, and Winther’s and on Hiptmair’s smoothers. Numerical tests show that the newly installed preconditioning technique greatly improves the convergence rate."

These internal and external peanut harmonic functions are expressed in terms of Lamé—Wangerin functions. Using the expansion for the fundamental solution, we derive an addition theorem for the azimuthal Fourier component in terms of the odd-half-integer degree Legendre function of the second kind as an infinite series in Lamé—Wangerin functions. We also derive integral identities over the Legendre function of the second kind for a product of three Lamé—Wangerin functions.

Previous work showed that such extensions always exist and we study the problem of simultaneous extension of multiple positive definite functions. More specifically, we define a concept of ‘relative energy’ which measures the proximity between a pair of positive definite functions, and show that a pair of positive definite functions on a finite ball can be extended to the entire group without increasing their relative energy. The proof is analytic, involving differentiation of noncommutative Szegö parameters."

It is known that if G is a compact Abelian group and E is a Banach space, then spectral synthesis holds in C(G, E). We give a self-contained proof of this fact, independent of the theory of almost periodic functions. On the other hand, we show that if G is an infinite and discrete Abelian group and E is a Banach space of infinite dimension, then even spectral analysis fails in C(G, E). We also prove that if G is discrete, has finite torsion free rank and if E is a Banach space of finite dimension, then spectral synthesis holds in C(G, E)."
0,On the generalized Hilbert transform and weighted Hardy spaces in q-Dunkl harmonic analysis,"In this paper, by using the harmonic analysis associated with the q-Dunkl operator, we introduce the q-Hilbert transform on the real line, we study some of its main properties. Among the properties, we will see that the q-Hilbert transform is a linear multiplier operator under the q-Dunkl transform and show that it is an isometric isomorphism from \(L_{q,\alpha }^{2}(\mathbb {R}_{q})\) into itself. To close this paper, we finally define the weighted Hardy spaces \(\mathbb {H}_{q,\alpha }^{1}(\mathbb {R}_{q})\) by q-Hilbert transforms. Moreover, we give a characterization of these spaces via q-Hilbert transforms associated with the q-Dunkl transform."
0,A Fundamental Condition for Harmonic Analysis in Anisotropic Generalized Orlicz Spaces,"Anisotropic generalized Orlicz spaces have been investigated in many recent papers, but the basic assumptions are not as well understood as in the isotropic case. We study the greatest convex minorant of anisotropic \(\Phi \)-functions and prove the equivalence of two widely used conditions in the theory of generalized Orlicz spaces, usually called (A1) and (M). This provides a more natural and easily verifiable condition for use in the theory of anisotropic generalized Orlicz spaces for results such as Jensen’s inequality which we obtain as a corollary."
0,Stability analysis of five-grade Leishmania epidemic model with harmonic mean-type incidence rate,"In this paper, we discuss the Anthroponotic Cutaneous Leishmania transmission. In addition, we develop a mathematical model for the Anthroponotic Cutaneous Leishmania transmission and consider its qualitative behavior. We derive the threshold number \(R_{0}\) of the model using the next generation method. In the disease-free case, we carry out the local and global stability under the condition \(R_{0}<1\). Moreover, we derive the global stability at the disease-free equilibrium point by utilizing the Castillo-Chavez method. On the other hand, at the endemic equilibrium point, we show the local and global stability to be held under specific conditions and \(R_{0}>1\). We also establish the global stability at the endemic equilibrium point with the help of a geometrical approach, which is a generalization of Lyapunov theory, by using a second additive compound matrix. Finally, we take into account the sensitivity analysis of the threshold number with other parameters. We also discuss several graphs of important parameters."
0,Invertibility of ‘large’ submatrices with applications to the geometry of Banach spaces and harmonic analysis,"The main problem investigated in this paper is that of restricted invertibility of linear operators acting on finite dimensionall  p -spaces. Our initial motivation to study such questions lies in their applications. The results obtained below enable us to complete earlier work on the structure of complemented subspaces ofL  p -spaces which have extremal euclidean distance.LetA be a realn ×n matrix considered as a linear operator onl  n p  ; l ≦p ≦ ∞. By restricted invertibility ofA, we mean the existence of a subset σ of {1, 2, …,n} such that |σ| ∼n andA acts as an isomorphism when restricted to the linear span of the unit vectorse  i   n i=1  There are various conditions under which this property holds. For instance, if the norm ‖A‖ p  ofA is bounded by a constant independent ofn and the diagonal ofA is the identity matrix, then there exists an index set σ, |σ| ∼n, for which (Rσ) has a bounded inverse σ stands for the restriction map). This is achieved by simply constructing the set σ so that ••R σ(A-I)R σ••p< 12 .The casep=2 is of particular interest. Although the problem is purely Hilbertian, the proofs involve besides the spacel 2 also the spacel 1. The methods are probabilistic and combinatorial. Crucial use is made of Grothendieck’s theorem.The paper also contains a nice application to the behavior of the trigonometric system on sets of positive measure, generalizing results on harmonic density. Given a subsetB of the circleT of positive Lebesgue measure, there exists a subset Λ of the integersZ of positive density dens Λ > 0 such that {fx137-1} whenever the support of the Fourier transform\(\overset{\lower0.5em\hbox{$\smash{\scriptscriptstyle\frown}$}}{f} \) off lies in Λ. The matrices involved here are Laurent matrices.The problem of restricted invertibility is meaningful beyond the class ofl  p -spaces, as is shown in a separate section. However, most of the paper uses specificl  p -techniques and complete results are obtained only in the context ofl  p -spaces."
0,Some new thin sets of integers in harmonic analysis,"We randomly construct various subsets A of the integers which have both smallness and largeness properties. They are small since they are very close, in various senses, to Sidon sets: the continuous functions with spectrum in Λ have uniformly convergent series, and their Fourier coefficients are in ℓp for all p > 1; moreover, all the Lebesgue spaces L qΛ  are equal forq < +∞. On the other hand, they are large in the sense that they are dense in the Bohr group and that the space of the bounded functions with spectrum in Λ is nonseparable. So these sets are very different from the thin sets of integers previously known."

We also prove several uncertainty principles for this transform such as Heisenberg type inequalities and Faris–Price type uncertainty principle.
0,Wiener–Ingham type inequality for Vilenkin groups and its application to harmonic analysis,"An important trigonometric inequality essentially due to Wiener but later on made precise by Ingham concerning the lacunary trigonometric sums \(f(x)=\sum A_ke^{in_kx}\), where \(A_k\)’s are complex numbers, \(n_{-k}=-n_k\) and \(\{n_k\}\) satisfies the small gap condition \((n_{k+1}-n_k)\ge q\ge 1\) for \(k=0,1,2,\ldots \), says that if I is any subinterval of \([-\pi ,\pi ]\) of length \(|I|=2\pi (1+\delta )/q>2\pi /q\) then \(\sum |A_k|^2\le A_{\delta }|I|^{-1}\int _I|f|^2\), \(|A_k|\le A_{\delta }|I|^{-1}\int _I|f|\), wherein \(A_{\delta }\) depends only on \(\delta \). Such an inequality is proved here in the setting of the Vilenkin groups G. The inequality is then applied to generalize the Bernstěin, Szász and Stečhkin type results concerning the absolute convergence of Fourier series on G."
0,Generalised operations in free harmonic analysis,"In this article we study the formal side of operations in free harmonic analysis and examine the emerging general picture of all this. We establish an analytic correspondence of semi-rings between Witt vectors and free probability, by building on previous joint work with Friedrich and McKay (Formal groups, Witt vectors and free probability, 2012. arXiv:1204.6522). In particular, an exponential map, which relates the free additive convolution semigroup on \({\mathbb {R}}\) with the free multiplicative convolution semigroup on either the unit circle or the positive real axis of compactly supported, freely infinitely divisible probability measures, is derived with complex analytic methods. Then we define several novel operations on these sets, discuss their relation with classically infinitely divisible measures and determine the internal geometry of the spaces involved. Finally, we formalise the structure induced by the various operations we have introduced, in the language of operads and algebraic theories."

0,Induced representations and harmonic analysis on finite groups,"The aim of the present paper is to develop a theory of spherical functions for noncommutative Hecke algebras on finite groups. Let G be a finite group, K a subgroup and \((\theta ,V)\) an irreducible, unitary K-representation. After a careful analysis of Frobenius reciprocity, we are able to introduce an orthogonal basis in the commutant of \(\text {Ind}_K^GV\), and an associated Fourier transform. Then we translate our results in the corresponding Hecke algebra, an isomorphic algebra in the group algebra of G. Again a complete Fourier analysis is developed. As particular cases, we obtain some classical results of Curtis and Fossum on the irreducible characters. Finally, we develop a theory of Gelfand–Tsetlin bases for Hecke algebras."
0,Quantitative weighted estimates for Harmonic analysis operators in the Bessel setting by using sparse domination,"In this paper we obtain quantitative weighted \(L^p\)-inequalities for some operators involving Bessel convolutions. We consider maximal operators, Littlewood-Paley functions and variational operators. We obtain \(L^p(w)\)-operator norms in terms of the \(A_p\)-characteristic of the weight w. In order to do this we show that the operators under consideration are dominated by a suitable family of sparse operators in the space of homogeneous type \(((0,\infty ),|\cdot |,x^{2\lambda }dx)\)."
0,Some questions of harmonic analysis in weighted Morrey type spaces,"Weighted Morrey-type classes of functions that are harmonic in the unit disk and in the upper half plane are defined in this work. Under some conditions on the weight function, we study some properties of functions belonging to these classes. Estimation of the maximum values of harmonic functions for a nontangential angle through the Hardy–Littlewood maximal function are generalized to more general case, and then the boundedness of Hardy–Littlewood operator is applied in the Morrey-type spaces. Weighted Morrey–Lebesgue type space is defined, where the shift operator is continuous with respect to shift, and its invariance with regard to the singular operator is proved. The validity of Minkowski inequality in Morrey–Lebesgue type spaces is also proved. An approximation properties of the Poisson kernel are studied."
0,Applications of classical approximation theory to periodic basis function networks and computational harmonic analysis,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to classical approximation theory of periodic univariate and multivariate functions by trigonometric polynomials. While classical wisdom holds that such approximation is too sensitive to the lack of smoothness of the target functions at isolated points, our constructions show how to overcome this problem. We describe applications to approximation by periodic basis function networks, and indicate further research in the direction of Jacobi expansion and approximation on the Euclidean sphere. While the paper is mainly intended to be a survey of our recent research in these directions, several results are proved for the first time here."

In this article we present results for harmonic functions on rank one asymptotically harmonic manifolds \(X\) with mild curvature boundedness conditions. Our main results are (a) the explicit calculation of the Radon–Nikodym derivative of the visibility measures, (b) an explicit integral representation for the solution of the Dirichlet problem at infinity in terms of these visibility measures, and (c) a result on horospherical means of bounded eigenfunctions implying that these eigenfunctions do not admit non-trivial continuous extensions to the geometric compactification \(\overline{X}\)."

In this paper, we obtain Bergman norm estimates of the partial derivatives for w, i.e., \(\Vert w_z\Vert _{L^p}\) and \(\Vert \overline{w_{{\bar{z}}}}\Vert _{L^p}\), where \(1\le p<2\). Furthermore, if w is a harmonic quasiregular mapping of \({\mathbb {D}}\), then we show that \(w_z\) and \(\overline{w_{{\bar{z}}}}\) are in the Hardy space \(H^p\), where \(1\le p\le \infty \). The corresponding Hardy norm estimates, \(\Vert w_z\Vert _{p}\) and \(\Vert \overline{w_{{\bar{z}}}}\Vert _{p}\), are also obtained."
0,Solving the Laplace equation by meshless collocation using harmonic kernels,"We present a meshless technique which can be seen as an alternative to the method of fundamental solutions (MFS). It calculates homogeneous solutions of the Laplacian (i.e. harmonic functions) for given boundary data by a direct collocation technique on the boundary using kernels which are harmonic in two variables. In contrast to the MFS, there is no artificial boundary needed, and there is a fairly general and complete error analysis using standard techniques from meshless methods for the recovery of functions. We present two explicit examples of harmonic kernels, a mathematical analysis providing error bounds and convergence rates, and some illustrating numerical examples."

Recall that, in the terminology of Everitt and Giertz, the differential operator A is said to be separated in L 2 (M) if for all u ∈ L 2 (M) such that Au ∈ L 2 (M) we have ΔE 2 u ∈ L 2 (M) and qu ∈ L 2 (M)."

0,Incremental harmonic balance method for airfoil flutter with multiple strong nonlinearities,"The incremental harmonic balance method was extended to analyze the flutter of systems with multiple structural strong nonlinearities. The strongly nonlinear cubic plunging and pitching stiffness terms were considered in the flutter equations of two-dimensional airfoil. First, the equations were transferred into matrix form, then the vibration process was divided into the persistent incremental processes of vibration moments. And the expression of their solutions could be obtained by using a certain amplitude as control parameter in the harmonic balance process, and then the bifurcation, limit cycle flutter phenomena and the number of harmonic terms were analyzed. Finally, numerical results calculated by the Runge-Kutta method were given to verify the results obtained by the proposed procedure. It has been shown that the incremental harmonic method is effective and precise in the analysis of strongly nonlinear flutter with multiple structural nonlinearities."

Secondly, our interest is focused on the properties of electrical networks supported on Bratteli diagrams. We show that the structure of Bratteli diagrams allows one to describe algorithmically harmonic functions as well as monopoles and dipoles. We also discuss some special classes of Bratteli diagrams (stationary, Pascal, trees), and we give conditions under which the harmonic functions defined on these diagrams have finite energy."

0,Harmonic maps with torsion,In this article we introduce a natural extension of the well-studied equation for harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds by assuming that the target manifold is equipped with a connection that is metric but has non-vanishing torsion. Such connections have already been classified in the work of Cartan (1924). The maps under consideration do not arise as critical points of an energy functional leading to interesting mathematical challenges. We will perform a first mathematical analysis of these maps which we will call harmonic maps with torsion.
0,On simulations of the classical harmonic oscillator equation by difference equations,We discuss the discretizations of the second-order linear ordinary diffrential equations with constant coefficients. Special attention is given to the exact discretization because there exists a difference equation whose solutions exactly coincide with solutions of the corresponding differential equation evaluated at a discrete sequence of points. Such exact discretization can be found for an arbitrary lattice spacing.

0,Differentiability of p-Harmonic Functions on Metric Measure Spaces,"We study p-harmonic functions on metric measure spaces, which are formulated as minimizers to certain energy functionals. For spaces supporting a p-Poincaré inequality, we show that such functions satisfy an infinitesmal Lipschitz condition almost everywhere. This result is essentially sharp, since there are examples of metric spaces and p-harmonic functions that fail to be locally Lipschitz continuous on them. As a consequence of our main theorem, we show that p-harmonic functions also satisfy a generalized differentiability property almost everywhere, in the sense of Cheeger’s measurable differentiable structures."
0,Vanishing theorems for ach Kähler manifolds and harmonic maps,We discuss a class of complete Kähler manifolds which are asymptotically complex hyperbolic near infinity. The main result is vanishing theorems for the second L 2 cohomology of such manifolds when it has positive spectrum. We also generalize the result to the weighted Poincaré inequality case and establish a vanishing theorem provided that the weighted function ρ is of sub-quadratic growth of the distance function. We also obtain a vanishing theorem of harmonic maps on manifolds which satisfies the weighted Poincaré inequality.
0,The method of harmonic balance applied to coupled asymmetrical van der Pol oscillators for intestinal modelling,"The spontaneous electrical rhythms recorded from the gastro-intestinal tract of humans and animals have been successfully modelled by an array of interconnected van der Pol oscillators. To account for asymmetry in the recorded waveforms (with particular reference to the human small intestine) an additional term in the van der Pol dynamics has been included. It is shown that the method of harmonic balance can be used to give analytical results for this asymmetrical condition. The non-linear algebraic equations are solved by hill-climbing to give values of d.c., fundamental and second harmonic amplitudes together with the entrained frequency. The results correlate well with actual measurements made on an analogue simulation by three different methods for waveshape factors of 0.1 and 1.0"
0,Polynomial growth harmonic functions on finitely generated abelian groups,"In the present paper, we develop geometric analysis techniques on Cayley graphs of finitely generated abelian groups to study the polynomial growth harmonic functions. We provide a geometric analysis proof of the classical Heilbronn theorem (Heilbronn in Proc Camb Philos Soc 45:194–206, 1949) and the recent Nayar theorem (Nayar in Bull Pol Acad Sci Math 57:231–242, 2009) on polynomial growth harmonic functions on lattices \(\mathbb Z ^n\) that does not use a representation formula for harmonic functions. In the abelian group case, by Yau’s gradient estimate, we actually give a simplified proof of a general polynomial growth harmonic function theorem of (Alexopoulos in Ann Probab 30:723–801, 2002). We calculate the precise dimension of the space of polynomial growth harmonic functions on finitely generated abelian groups by linear algebra, rather than by Floquet theory Kuchment and Pinchover (Trans Am Math Soc 359:5777–5815, 2007). While the Cayley graph not only depends on the abelian group, but also on the choice of a generating set, we find that this dimension depends only on the group itself. Moreover, we also calculate the dimension of solutions to higher order Laplace operators."
0,1/3 Pure sub-harmonic solution and fractal characteristic of transient process for Duffing’s equation,"The 1/3 sub-harmonic solution for the Duffing’s with damping equation was investigated by using the methods of harmonic balance and numerical integration. The assumed solution is introduced, and the domain of sub-harmonic frequencies was found. The asymptotical stability of the subharmonic resonances and the sensitivity of the amplitude responses to the variation of damping coefficient were examined. Then, the subharmonic resonances were analyzed by using the techniques from the general fractal theory. The analysis indicates that the sensitive dimensions of the system time-field responses show sensitivity to the conditions of changed initial perturbation, changed damping coefficient or the amplitude of excitation, thus the sensitive dimension can clearly describe the characteristic of the transient process of the subharmonic resonances."

We use oriented Jordan curves in the plane to prove that for a finely locally injective finely harmonic morphism f in a fine domain in C, either f or f is a finely holomorphic function. This partially extends result by Fuglede, who considered a kind of continuity for the fine derivatives of the finely harmonic morphism. As a consequence of this we obtain a both necessary and sufficient condition for a function f to be finely holomorphic or finely antiholomorphic. We do not know if the condition of finely local injectivity (q.e.) is automatically fulfilled by any non-constant finely harmonic morphism."

It is known that, for each w ∈ Ω, there exist harmonic functions on Ω that are universal at w, in the sense that partial sums of their homogeneous polynomial expansion about w approximate all plausibly approximable functions in the complement of Ω. Under the assumption that Ω omits an infinite cone, it is shown that the connectedness hypothesis on \(\left(\mathbb{R}^{N}\cup\lbrace\infty\rbrace\right)\setminus\Omega\) is essential, and that a harmonic function which is universal at one point is actually universal at all points of Ω."

0,Non-Commutative Harmonic and Subharmonic Polynomials,"The paper introduces a notion of the Laplace operator of a polynomial p in noncommutative variables x = (x 1,…, x  g ). The Laplacian Lap[p, h] of p is a polynomial in x and in a noncommuting variable h. When all variables commute we have Lap[p, h] = h 2Δ x  p where Δ x  p is the usual Laplacian. A symmetric polynomial in symmetric variables will be called harmonic if Lap[p, h] = 0 and subharmonic if the polynomial q(x, h) :=  Lap[p, h] takes positive semidefinite matrix values whenever matrices X 1,…, X  g , H are substituted for the variables x 1,…, x  g , h. In this paper we classify all homogeneous symmetric harmonic and subharmonic polynomials in two symmetric variables. We find there are not many of them: for example, the span of all such subharmonics of any degree higher than 4 has dimension 2 (if odd degree) and 3 (if even degree). Hopefully, the approach here will suggest ways of defining and analyzing other partial differential equations and inequalities."

It is simpler than the formula in [2], and can be regarded as an extension of [1] under the weighted case."
0,A Remark on Isolated Singularities at the Free Boundary of Harmonic Maps,Using a simple lemma on harmonic functions it is shown how well known results can be combined to exclude isolated singularities at the free boundary of two-dimensional weakly harmonic maps.
0,Regularity of generalized sphere valued p-harmonic maps with small mean oscillations,"We prove (see Theorem 1.3 below) that a generalized harmonic map into a round sphere, i.e. a map u∈W 1,1  loc (Ω,𝕊n−1) which solves the system \({{ {{{{\rm{ div}}}}}(u^i\nabla u^j - u^j\nabla u^i) =0,{{\quad}}\!i,j=1,\ldots,n, }}\) is smooth as soon as |∇u|∈L q for any q>1, and the norm of u in BMO is sufficiently small. Here, Ω⊂ℝm is open, and m,n are arbitrary. This extends various earlier results of Almeida [1], Ge [15], and R. Moser [38]. A version of this result for generalized p-harmonic maps into spheres is also proved. The proofs rely on the duality of Hardy space and BMO combined with L p stability of the Hodge decomposition and reverse Hölder inequalities."
0,Solving the 3D Laplace equation by meshless collocation via harmonic kernels,"This paper solves the Laplace equation Δu = 0 on domains Ω ⊂ ℝ3 by meshless collocation on scattered points of the boundary \(\partial\Omega\). Due to the use of new positive definite kernels K(x, y) which are harmonic in both arguments and have no singularities for x = y, one can directly interpolate on the boundary, and there is no artificial boundary needed as in the Method of Fundamental Solutions. In contrast to many other techniques, e.g. the Boundary Point Method or the Method of Fundamental Solutions, we provide a solid and comprehensive mathematical foundation which includes error bounds and works for general star-shaped domains. The convergence rates depend only on the smoothness of the domain and the boundary data. Some numerical examples are included."
0,A Semigroup Approach to Harmonic Maps,"We present a semigroup approach to harmonic maps between metric spaces. Our basic assumption on the target space (N,d) is that it admits a “barycenter contraction”, i.e. a contracting map which assigns to each probability measure q on N a point b(q) in N. This includes all metric spaces with globally nonpositive curvature in the sense of Alexandrov as well as all metric spaces with globally nonpositive curvature in the sense of Busemann. It also includes all Banach spaces.The analytic input comes from the domain space (M,ρ) where we assume that we are given a Markov semigroup (pt)t>0. Typical examples come from elliptic or parabolic second-order operators on Rn, from Lévy type operators, from Laplacians on manifolds or on metric measure spaces and from convolution operators on groups. In contrast to the work of Korevaar and Schoen (1993, 1997), Jost (1994, 1997), Eells and Fuglede (2001) our semigroups are not required to be symmetric.The linear semigroup acting, e.g., on the space of bounded measurable functions u:M→R gives rise to a nonlinear semigroup (P *t )t acting on certain classes of measurable maps f:M → N. We will show that contraction and smoothing properties of the linear semigroup (pt)t can be extended to the nonlinear semigroup (P *t )t, for instance, Lp–Lq smoothing, hypercontractivity, and exponentially fast convergence to equilibrium. Among others, we state existence and uniqueness of the solution to the Dirichlet problem for harmonic maps between metric spaces. Moreover, for this solution we prove Lipschitz continuity in the interior and Hölder continuity at the boundary.Our approach also yields a new interpretation of curvature assumptions which are usually required to deduce regularity results for the harmonic map flow: lower Ricci curvature bounds on the domain space are equivalent to estimates of the L1-Wasserstein distance between the distribution of two Brownian motions in terms of the distance of their starting points; nonpositive sectional curvature on the target space is equivalent to the fact that the L1-Wasserstein distance of two distributions always dominates the distance of their barycenters."

Inthe compact case, we recover a version of the Eells–Sampson theorem,while for noncompact target manifold N, we establishsuitable hypotheses and ensure global existence and convergence atinfinity. In the second part of the paper, we study phenomena of blowingup solutions."
0,Concentrated boundary data and axially symmetric harmonic maps,"We examine the existence problem for harmonic maps between the three-dimensional ball and the two-sphere. We utilize results on the classification of harmonic maps into hemispheres and a result on the regularity of the weak limit of energy minimizers over the class of axially symmetric maps to establish the existence of asmooth harmonic extension for boundary data suitably “concentrated” away from the axis of symmetry. In addition, we establish convergence results for the harmonic map heat flow problem for suitably “concentrated” axially symmetric initial and boundary data."

Furthermore, if (M, g) has positive isotropic curvature at some point, then there is no non-trivial L 2 harmonic two-form. We obtain that an almost Kähler manifold of non-negative isotropic curvature is Kähler and a symplectic manifold can not admit any almost Kähler structure of positive isotropic curvature."
0,Harmonic and subharmonic bifurcation in the Brussel model with periodic force,"A famous model, the chemical reaction-Brussel model with periodic force, is investigated. We study the regular Hopf bifurcation and singular Hopf bifurcation from a basic equilibrium, and show the existence of the subharmonic solutions by using the averaging method and perturbed methods and bifurcation equations. By our analysis it can be shown that the homoclinic orbits do not occur, so we can conjecture that the harmonic oscillation can make successive subharmonic bifurcations, until a chaotic state ultimately develops. The results and methods in this paper are our first step in theoretically treating the transition to a chaotic state in the Brussel model and are appropriate to investigating the general nonlinear oscillation with periodic force."

The proofs of these results make use the Gauss–Lucas Theorem. Our results show that two recent conjectures, the one by Kumar, Gupta, Singh and Dorff, and the one of Liu, Jiang and Li, are true. Moreover, examples of univalent harmonic mappings related to the above-mentioned results are presented, suggesting that the bounds given by our results may be sharp."

A conjugation by the inversion brings the singularity at the origin, and a conjugation by the Cayley transform and an isometry of the ball moves the singularity at any point on the sphere."

We consider various spaces of harmonic mapsu: Ω →N that have a singular setZ and controlled behavior nearZ. We study the structure of such spacesH and questions of existence, uniqueness, stability, and minimality under perturbation. In caseZ = 0,H is a Banach manifold locally diffeomorphic to a submanifold of the product of the boundary data space with a finite-dimensional space of Jacobi fields with controlled singular behavior.

Among properties of such functions we investigate various types of Harnack estimates on balls and compact sets, weak and strong maximum principles, comparison principles, the Hölder and the Lipschitz estimates and some differentiability properties. The latter one is based on the notion of a weak upper gradient. The Dirichlet problem for functions satisfying the mean value property is studied via the dynamical programming method related to stochastic games. Finally, we discuss and prove the Liouville type theorems. Our results are obtained for various types of measures: continuous with respect to a metric, doubling, uniform, measures satisfying the annular decay condition. Relations between such measures are presented as well. The presentation is illustrated by examples."

Then we show that a harmonic Bloch mapping f is a support point of the unit ball of the normalized harmonic Bloch spaces in 𝔻 if and only if the Bloch unit-valued set of f is not empty. We also give a characterization for the support points of the unit ball of the harmonic Bloch spaces in 𝔻."

In dimension two we specify the dependence of the constants on Z in these inequalities by showing that only the number of nodal domains of u, i.e. the number of connected components of \({B\setminus Z}\), plays a role."
0,A continuation fixed-point iterative method on harmonic generations with strong nonlinear optical effects in multi-layer structures,"A continuation fixed-point iterative method for harmonic generations with strong nonlinear optical effects in one-dimensional nonlinear multi-layer structures, which are governed by the nonlinear Helmholtz systems, is presented in this paper. Three kinds of harmonic generations via \(\chi ^{(2)}\) or \(\chi ^{(3)}\) nonlinear process, which are important phenomena in nonlinear optics, are modeled as the application of our proposed method. In the regime of strong nonlinearity, the theoretical and computational analysis of the model problems encounters enormous challenges due to the discontinuity across layers and the strongly nonlinear coupling of modes. To overcome the difficulties in the nonlinearity and discontinuity, a fixed-point iteration with the finite element method is used to study the nonlinear conversion efficiencies by solving the weak formulations. Furthermore, a continuation technique that depends on the weak formulations to solve three model problems, is introduced to handle the iterative procedure for cases with large nonlinearity. The theoretical framework and numerical algorithm towards a uniform process is offered to study almost all the harmonic generations in \(\chi ^{(2)}\) or \(\chi ^{(3)}\) interaction. With the continuation fixed-point iterative technique, the convergence of the iterative procedure can be ensured, even in the presence of strong nonlinearity. Three numerical experiments with high conversion efficiencies are also presented to show the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method."

We also prove that if two complete Riemannian manifolds are roughly isometric to each other, then their p-harmonic boundaries are homeomorphic to each other. In the case, there is a one to one correspondence between the sets of bounded energy finite solutions on such manifolds. In particular, in the case of the Laplacian, it becomes a linear isomorphism between the spaces of bounded harmonic functions with finite Dirichlet integral on the manifolds. "

We then show that for a lamination with singularities of a compact set in \(\mathbb{P}^2, \) without directed positive closed currents, there is a unique positive harmonic current which minimizes energy. If X is a compact laminated set in \(\mathbb{P}^2 \) of class \(\mathcal{C}^{1} \) it carries a unique positive harmonic current T of mass 1. The current T can be obtained by an Ahlfors type construction starting with an arbitrary leaf of X. When X has a totally disconnected set of singularities, contained in a countable union of analytic sets, the above construction still gives positive harmonic currents."

We show that, under certain restrictions on the holonomy of the connection, the lifted diffusion on the orthonormal frame bundle has the same ∗-recurrence property as the original Brownian motion. This observation leads us to introduce a technique we call scalarization which reduces the problem of discretization for a tensor field to that of ordinary harmonic functions."

0,"A Maximum Principle for Generalizations of Harmonic Maps in Hermitian, Affine, Weyl, and Finsler Geometry","In this note we prove that the maximum principle of Jäger–Kaul for harmonic maps holds for a more general class of maps, \(V\)-harmonic maps. This includes Hermitian harmonic maps (Jost and Yau, Acta Math 170:221–254, 1993), Weyl harmonic maps (Kokarev, Proc Lond Math Soc 99:168–194, 2009), affine harmonic maps Jost and Simsir (Analysis (Munich) 29:185–197, 2009), and Finsler maps from a Finsler manifold into a Riemannian manifold. With this maximum principle we establish the existence of \(V\)-harmonic maps into regular balls."

In particular, for a local difference M of bounded potentials that are locally less then 1 or that are countable sum of continuous potentials it turns out that the perturbed space is again a Bauer space if and only if M is continuous (i.e., the difference is continuous, but not necessarily each potential."

0,"Harmonic Functions, Entropy, and a Characterization of the Hyperbolic Space"," Let (M n,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold with Ric ≥−(n−1). It is well known that the bottom of spectrum λ 0 of its universal covering satisfies λ 0≤(n−1)2/4. We prove that equality holds iff M is hyperbolic. This follows from a sharp estimate for the Kaimanovich entropy. "

Diamo qui una nuova e più esplicita dimostrazione di quel risultato. Essa, essendo più libera da certi procedimenti speciali di analisi armonica, si può adattare a corrispondenti caratterizzazioni per le soluzioni di problemi ben posti di varie equazioni a derivate parziali. In [4] per esempio abbiamo dato un risultato analogo per il problema di valori iniziali per l’equazione del calore con dati iniziali inBMO(R n)."

Under his guidance and encouragement his students started the research on spherical harmonic analysis and approximation. In this paper, we incompletely introduce the main achievements in this area obtained by our group and relative researchers during recent 5 years (2001–2005). The main topics are: convergence of Cesàro summability, a.e. and strong summability of Fourier-Laplace series; smoothness and K-functionals; Kolmogorov and linear widths."

Some ω-weighted classes of delta-subharmonic functions with bounded Tsuji type characteristics are introduced in the upper half-plane and the descriptive representations of these classes are found."
0,Non-conforming Harmonic Virtual Element Method: \(h\)- and \(p\)-Versions,"We study the \(h\)- and \(p\)-versions of non-conforming harmonic virtual element methods (VEM) for the approximation of the Dirichlet–Laplace problem on a 2D polygonal domain, providing quasi-optimal error bounds. Harmonic VEM do not make use of internal degrees of freedom. This leads to a faster convergence, in terms of the number of degrees of freedom, as compared to standard VEM. Importantly, the technical tools used in our \(p\)-analysis can be employed as well in the analysis of more general non-conforming finite element methods and VEM. The theoretical results are validated in a series of numerical experiments. The hp-version of the method is numerically tested, demonstrating exponential convergence with rate given by the square root of the number of degrees of freedom."
0,Complex Geodesics in Tube Domains and Their Role in the Study of Harmonic Mappings in the Disc,We continue the research on the structure of complex geodesics in tube domains over (bounded) convex bases. In some special cases a more explicit form of the geodesics than the existing ones are provided. As one of the consequences of our study an effective formula for the Kobayashi—Royden metric in the tube domain \({T_{{\mathbb{B}_n}}}\) at the origin is given. The results on the Kobayashi—Royden metric in a natural way provide versions of the Schwarz Lemma for harmonic mappings. We also present a result on harmonic mappings defined on the disc that may be seen as a generalisation of the Radó—Kneser—Choquet Theorem for a class of harmonic bivalent mappings that lets understand better the geometry of complex geodesics in tube domains.

We establish an estimate of the conjugate \(\tilde u\) of the same type which is sharp in some sense, and in the case E = ∂ⅅ coincides with known estimates. As an application we describe growth classes defined by the non-radial condition |u(z)| ≾ ρ−q(z) in terms of smoothness of the Stieltjes measure associated to the harmonic function u."
0,Harmonic balance method with alternating frequency/time domain technique for nonlinear dynamical system with fractional exponential,"Comparisons of the common methods for obtaining the periodic responses show that the harmonic balance method with alternating frequency/time (HB-AFT) domain technique has some advantages in dealing with nonlinear problems of fractional exponential models. By the HB-AFT method, a rigid rotor supported by ball bearings with nonlinearity of Hertz contact and ball passage vibrations is considered. With the aid of the Floquet theory, the movement characteristics of interval stability are deeply studied. Besides, a simple strategy to determine the monodromy matrix is proposed for the stability analysis."

The shortest-wavelength harmonic emission corresponding to the 91st order harmonic (8.63nm) is observed in argon. In neon, the harmonics up to order 131 (5.99nm) is also observed. The effects of gas density, laser intensity, free electron and the focusing geometry parameters of the laser beam on the process of harmonic generation are investigated. The direct experimental evidence that an increased electron density causes a degenerated harmonic radiation is obtained."

We also investigate the uniform boundedness and quasiconformal extendability of strongly starlike functions. Some coefficient conditions can be given for strong starlikeness and spirallikeness. We consider a special form of harmonic functions as an application."
0,Inner estimate and quasiconformal harmonic maps between smooth domains,"We prove a type of “inner estimate” for quasi-conformal diffeomorphisms, which satisfies a certain estimate concerning their Laplacian. This, in turn, implies that quasiconformal harmonic mappings between smooth domains (with respect to an approximately analytic metric), have bounded partial derivatives; in particular, these mappings are Lipschitz. We discuss harmonic mappings with respect to (a) spherical and Euclidean metrics (which are approximately analytic) (b) the metric induced by a holomorphic quadratic differential."
0,Asymptotic Dirichlet Problem for \(\mathcal {A}\)-Harmonic Functions on Manifolds with Pinched Curvature,"We study the asymptotic Dirichlet problem for \(\mathcal {A}\)-harmonic functions on a Cartan-Hadamard manifold whose radial sectional curvatures outside a compact set satisfy an upper bound \( K(P)\le - \frac {1+\varepsilon }{r(x)^{2} \log r(x)} \) and a pointwise pinching condition \( | K(P) |\le C_{K}| K(P^{\prime }) | \) for some constants ε > 0 and C  K  ≥ 1, where P and \(P^{\prime }\) are any 2-dimensional subspaces of T  x  M containing the (radial) vector ∇r(x) and r(x) = d(o, x) is the distance to a fixed point o ∈ M. We solve the asymptotic Dirichlet problem with any continuous boundary data \(f\in C(\partial _{\infty } M)\). The results apply also to the Laplacian and p-Laplacian, \(1<p<\infty ,\) as special cases."
0,Nonuniform Sampling of Complex-Valued Harmonic Functions,"The class \(\mathcal{H}_{\sigma,\mathbb{C}}\) of complex-valued entire harmonic functions of exponential type σ contains various interesting subclasses such as bandlimited signals, Bernstein classes, Paley-Wiener classes, entire functions of exponential type, and real-valued entire harmonic functions of exponential type. First, we mention some properties of the class \(\mathcal{H}_{\sigma,\mathbb{C}}\) and its subclasses. Then we show that every function w ∈ \(\mathcal{H}_{\sigma,\mathbb{C}}\) is uniquely determined by samples of w and of the Wirtinger derivative \(\partial w/\partial \bar z\), the samples being taken on two sequences of (not necessarily uniform) points on the real line. Finally, we establish formulae for the reconstruction of w from these samples, treating the cases of 'sampling at a lowest rate' and 'oversampling' separately. By a restriction of these formulae to subclasses of \(\mathcal{H}_{\sigma,\mathbb{C}}\) , several old and new results on nonuniform sampling of functions can be deduced."
0,"Superrigidity, Generalized Harmonic Maps and Uniformly Convex Spaces","We prove several superrigidity results for isometric actions on Busemann non-positively curved uniformly convex metric spaces. In particular we generalize some recent theorems of N. Monod on uniform and certain non-uniform irreducible lattices in products of locally compact groups, and we give a proof of an unpublished result on commensurability superrigidity due to G.A. Margulis. The proofs rely on certain notions of harmonic maps and the study of their existence, uniqueness, and continuity."

0,On the method of harmonic linearization,"The development of numerical methods, computational engineering, and the applied theory of bifurcations made it possible to consider the application and verification of the harmonic linearization procedure from new positions. The joint application of the harmonic linearization procedure, the classical method of a small parameter, and numerical methods enables calculating the periodic modes of automatic control systems by the multistage procedure, where at the first stage the method of harmonic linearization is used."
0,Harmonic Interpolating Wavelets in a Ring,"Complementing the authors' earlier joint papers on the application of orthogonal wavelets to represent solutions of Dirichlet problems with the Laplace operator and its powers in a disk and a ring and of interpolating wavelets for the same problem in a disk, we develop a technique of applying periodic interpolating wavelets in a ring for the Dirichlet boundary value problem. The emphasis is not on the exact representation of the solution in the form of (double) series in a wavelet system but on the approximation of solutions with any given accuracy by finite linear combinations of dyadic rational translations of special harmonic polynomials; these combinations are constructed with the use of interpolating wavelets. The obtained approximation formulas are simply calculated, especially if the squared Fourier transform of the Meyer scaling function with the properties described in the paper is explicitly defined in terms of the corresponding elementary functions."

In the paper one answers affirmatively a question raised by B. Rodkin [K. F. Barth, D. A. Branna, and W. K. Hayman, “Research problems in complx analysis,” Bull. London Math. Soc.,l6, No. 5, 490–517, 1984]. Namely, one proves that in the family ɛ(d0) of continua E ∃ ɛ, satisfying the condition diam E=d0,o<d0⩽2, one has the inequality\(\omega _{\rm E} (0) \geqslant \frac{1}{\pi }\) arcsin d0/2, one indicates all the cases for which equality prevails."

As a corollary, we characterize the differential of a map as a harmonic morphism."
0,Harmonic morphisms from the classical compact semisimple Lie groups,"In this article, we introduce a new method for manufacturing harmonic morphisms from semi-Riemannian manifolds. This is employed to yield a variety of new examples from the compact Lie groups SO(n), SU(n) and Sp(n) equipped with their standard Riemannian metrics. We develop a duality principle and show how this can be used to construct the first known examples of harmonic morphisms from the non-compact Lie groups \({\bf SL}_n({\mathbb{R}})\), SU *(2n), \({\bf Sp}(n, {\mathbb{R}})\) , SO *(2n), SO(p, q), SU(p, q) and Sp(p, q) equipped with their standard dual semi-Riemannian metrics."

Our results are extensions of those obtained by Bass and Kassmann (Commun Part Diff Eq 30:1249–1259, 2005)."
0,An Area Theorem for Joint Harmonic Functions on the Product of Homogeneous Trees,"For harmonic functions v on the disc, it has been known for a long time that non-tangential boundedness a.e.is equivalent to finiteness a.e. of the integral of the area function of v (Lusin area theorem). This result also hold for functions that are non-tangentially bounded only in a measurable subset of the boundary, and has been extended to rank-one hyperbolic spaces, and also to infinite trees (homogeneous or not). No equivalent of the Lusin area theorem is known on higher rank symmetric spaces, with the exception of the degenerate higher rank case given by the cartesian product of rank-one hyperbolic spaces. Indeed, for products of two discs, an area theorem for jointly harmonic functions was proved by M.P. and P. Malliavin, who introduced a new area function; non-tangential boundedness a.e. is a sufficient condition, but not necessary, for the finiteness of this area integral. Their result was later extended to general products of rank-one hyperbolic spaces by Korányi and Putz. Here we prove an area theorem for jointly harmonic functions on the product of a finite number of infinite homogeneous trees; for the sake of simplicity, we give the proofs for the product of two trees. This could be the first step to an area theorem for Bruhat–Tits affine buildings, thereby shedding light on the higher rank continuous set-up."
0,Existence of (Dirac-)harmonic Maps from Degenerating (Spin) Surfaces,"We study the existence of harmonic maps and Dirac-harmonic maps from degenerating surfaces to a nonpositive curved manifold via the scheme of Sacks and Uhlenbeck. By choosing a suitable sequence of \(\alpha \)-(Dirac-)harmonic maps from a sequence of suitable closed surfaces degenerating to a hyperbolic surface, we get the convergence and a cleaner energy identity under the uniformly bounded energy assumption. In this energy identity, there is no energy loss near the punctures. As an application, we obtain an existence result about (Dirac-)harmonic maps from degenerating (spin) surfaces. If the energies of the map parts also stay away from zero, which is a necessary condition, both the limiting harmonic map and Dirac-harmonic map are nontrivial."
0,Local Symmetry of Harmonic Spaces as Determined by The Spectra of Small Geodesic Spheres,"We show that in any harmonic space, the eigenvalue spectra of the Laplace operator on small geodesic spheres around a given point determine the norm \({{|\nabla{R}|}}\) of the covariant derivative of the Riemannian curvature tensor in that point. In particular, the spectra of small geodesic spheres in a harmonic space determine whether the space is locally symmetric. For the proof we use the first few heat invariants and consider certain coefficients in the radial power series expansions of the curvature invariants |R|2 and |Ric|2 of the geodesic spheres. Moreover, we obtain analogous results for geodesic balls with either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. We also comment on the relevance of these results to constructions of Z.I. Szabó."
0,The maximum principle and the Dirichlet problem for Dirac-harmonic maps,We establish a maximum principle and uniqueness for Dirac-harmonic maps from a Riemannian spin manifold with boundary into a regular ball in any Riemannian manifold N.

0,On Domains in Which Harmonic Functions Satisfy Generalized Mean Value Properties,"Assume that a bounded domain Ω⊂ℝN (N ≥ 2) has the property that there exists a signed measure µ with compact support in Ω such that, for every integrable harmonic function h in Ω, ∫Ω h dx = ∫Ω h dµ(Ω is a ‘quadrature domain’). The main question studied is whether this implies that Ω has the same property for some positive measure (with in general larger, but still compact, support). We show that this is the case provided every positive harmonic function in Ω is the pointwise limit of a sequence of integrable positive harmonic functions in Ω. Moreover, for N = 2 we give a complete affirmative answer of the main question. This result is partially based on a previously known explicit description of all quadrature domains in two dimensions."

We derive a sharp condition to guarantee the continuity of solutions u. In particular, we show that when n ≥ 3, the condition that, for some \({\epsilon >0 ,}\) f belongs to$${\mathfrak{L}}({\rm log}\,{\mathfrak{L}})^{n-1}({\rm log}\,{\rm log}\,{\mathfrak{L}})^{n-2}\cdots({\rm log}\cdots{\rm log}\,{\mathfrak{L}})^{n-2}({\rm log}\cdots{\rm log}\,{\mathfrak{L}})^{n-2+\epsilon}(\Omega)$$is sufficient for continuity of u, but not for \({\epsilon=0}\)."
0,Conformal Contractions and Lower Bounds on the Density of Harmonic Measure,"We give a concrete sufficient condition for a simply-connected domain to be the image of the unit disk under a nonexpansive conformal map. This class of domains is also characterized by having sufficiently dense harmonic measure. The relation with the harmonic measure provides a natural higher-dimensional analogue of this problem, which is also addressed."

If f is a harmonic quasiconformal mapping between the unit ball in \(\mathbb {R}^{n}\) and a spatial domain with C1,α boundary, then f is Lipschitz continuous in B. This generalizes some known results for n = 2 and improves some others in higher dimensional case."
0,Positive Harmonic Functions that Vanish on a Subset of a Cylindrical Surface,"This paper investigates positive harmonic functions on domains that are complementary to a subset of a cylindrical surface. It characterizes, both in terms of harmonic measure and of a Wiener-type criterion, those domains that admit minimal harmonic functions with exponential growth. Illustrative examples are provided. Two applications are also given. The first of these concerns minimal harmonic functions associated with an irregular boundary point, and amplifies a recent construction of Gardiner and Hansen. The second concerns the possible non-approximability of positive harmonic functions by integrable positive harmonic functions."
